| **[Keeping it Local, Tiny and Real: Automated Report Generation on Edge Computing Devices for Mechatronic-Based Cognitive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02507v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems, that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services. In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table; accepted for MECATRONICS-REM 2025 International Conference, PARIS, FRANCE December 3-5 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards classification-based representation learning for place recognition on LiDAR scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00738v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is a crucial task in autonomous driving, allowing vehicles to determine their position using sensor data. While most existing methods rely on contrastive learning, we explore an alternative approach by framing place recognition as a multi-class classification problem. Our method assigns discrete location labels to LiDAR scans and trains an encoder-decoder model to classify each scan's position directly. We evaluate this approach on the NuScenes dataset and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to contrastive learning-based methods while offering advantages in training efficiency and stability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Chance-Constrained Neural MPC under Uncontrollable Agents via Sequential Convex Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03293v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the challenge of ensuring safety guarantees under uncontrollable agents whose behaviors are stochastic and depend on both their own and the system's states. We present a neural model predictive control (MPC) framework that predicts the trajectory of the uncontrollable agent using a predictor learned from offline data. To provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction errors, we employ split conformal prediction to construct region-specific, time-dependent uncertainty bounds, which are integrated into the MPC formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex, discontinuous optimization problem, we propose a two-loop iterative sequential convex programming algorithm. The inner loop solves convexified subproblems with fixed error bounds, while the outer loop refines these bounds based on updated control sequences. We establish convergence guarantees under mild regularity conditions and demonstrate the optimality of the algorithm. We illustrate our method with an autonomous driving scenario involving interactive pedestrians. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior safety and efficiency compared to baseline methods, with success rates exceeding 99.5\% while maintaining higher average speeds in multi-pedestrian scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Crucial-Diff: A Unified Diffusion Model for Crucial Image and Annotation Synthesis in Data-scarce Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09915v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset, Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%.

| **[3D Point Cloud Object Detection on Edge Devices for Split Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02293v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing, with deep learning being a key component. Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for 3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex, leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

| **[LLMs as Judges: Toward The Automatic Review of GSN-compliant Assurance Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02203v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assurance cases allow verifying the correct implementation of certain non-functional requirements of mission-critical systems, including their safety, security, and reliability. They can be used in the specification of autonomous driving, avionics, air traffic control, and similar systems. They aim to reduce risks of harm of all kinds including human mortality, environmental damage, and financial loss. However, assurance cases often tend to be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their creation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques, such as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to enhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task that ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their acceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that leverages the \textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process. Specifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize well-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM prompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show that, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately outperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that human reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adv-BMT: Bidirectional Motion Transformer for Safety-Critical Traffic Scenario Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09485v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial traffic interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstructs the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20%. Demo and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/adv-bmt/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://metadriverse.github.io/adv-bmt) |
| **[MetAdv: A Unified and Interactive Adversarial Testing Platform for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06534v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating and ensuring the adversarial robustness of autonomous driving (AD) systems is a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper introduces MetAdv, a novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical sandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines, end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments, with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla. A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM 2025 Most Popular Demo Award</p></details> | None |
| **[UniLION: Towards Unified Autonomous Driving Model with Linear Group RNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01768v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, their quadratic attention mechanisms introduce significant computational overhead when processing long-sequence data. In this paper, we present a unified autonomous driving model, UniLION, which efficiently handles large-scale LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution multi-view images, and even temporal sequences based on the linear group RNN operator (i.e., performs linear RNN for grouped features). Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single versatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized variants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal temporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or multi-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive and even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks, including 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D occupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion prediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm naturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous driving systems while maintaining superior performance. Ultimately, we hope UniLION offers a fresh perspective on the development of 3D foundation models in autonomous driving.

| **[LLM-Assisted Tool for Joint Generation of Formulas and Functions in Rule-Based Verification of Map Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01423v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-definition map transformations are essential in autonomous driving systems, enabling interoperability across tools. Ensuring their semantic correctness is challenging, since existing rule-based frameworks rely on manually written formulas and domain-specific functions, limiting scalability. In this paper, We present an LLM-assisted pipeline that jointly generates logical formulas and corresponding executable predicates within a computational FOL framework, extending the map verifier in CommonRoad scenario designer with elevation support. The pipeline leverages prompt-based LLM generation to produce grammar-compliant rules and predicates that integrate directly into the existing system. We implemented a prototype and evaluated it on synthetic bridge and slope scenarios. The results indicate reduced manual engineering effort while preserving correctness, demonstrating the feasibility of a scalable, semi-automated human-in-the-loop approach to map-transformation verification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VeriODD: From YAML to SMT-LIB -- Automating Verification of Operational Design Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01417v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operational Design Domains (ODDs) define the conditions under which an Automated Driving System (ADS) is allowed to operate, while Current Operational Domains (CODs) capture the actual runtime situation. Ensuring that a COD instance lies within the ODD is a crucial step in safety assurance. Today, ODD and COD specifications are frequently expressed in YAML to remain accessible for stakeholders, but such descriptions are not directly suitable for solver-based verification. Manual translation into formal languages such as SMT-LIB is slow and error-prone. We present VeriODD, a tool that automates this translation. VeriODD uses ANTLR-based compiler technology to transform YAML-based ODD/COD specifications into both human-readable propositional logic, for lightweight review on a simple basis, and solver-ready SMT-LIB. The tool integrates with SMT solvers such as Z3 to provide automated consistency checks of ODD specifications and verification of COD conformance. A graphical user interface supports editing specifications, inspecting generated formulas, and performing verification with a single click. VeriODD thereby closes the gap between stakeholder-friendly ODD/COD notations and formal verification, enabling scalable and automated assurance of operational boundaries in autonomous driving.

| **[Risk Aware Safe Control with Cooperative Sensing for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01403v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the design, development, and on vehicle implementation and validation of a safety critical controller for autonomous driving under sensing and communication uncertainty. Cooperative sensing, fused via a Wasserstein barycenter (WB), is used to optimize the distribution of the dynamic obstacle locations. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is introduced to form a risk aware control-barrier-function (CBF) framework with the optimized distribution samplings. The proposed WB CVaR CBF safety filter improves control inputs that minimize tail risk while certifying forward invariance of the safe set. A model predictive controller (MPC) performs path tracking, and the safety filter modulates the nominal control inputs to enforce risk aware constraints. We detail the software architecture and integration with vehicle actuation and cooperative sensing. The approach is evaluated on a full-scale autonomous vehicle (AV) in scenarios with measurement noise, communication perturbations, and input disturbances, and is compared against a baseline MPC CBF design. Results demonstrate improved safety margins and robustness, highlighting the practicality of deploying the risk-aware safety filter on an actual AV.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Embodied Cognition Augmented End2End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01334v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a new paradigm. However, popular end-to-end approaches typically rely on visual feature extraction networks trained under label supervision. This limited supervision framework restricts the generality and applicability of driving models. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm termed $E^{3}AD$, which advocates for comparative learning between visual feature extraction networks and the general EEG large model, in order to learn latent human driving cognition for enhancing end-to-end planning. In this work, we collected a cognitive dataset for the mentioned contrastive learning process. Subsequently, we investigated the methods and potential mechanisms for enhancing end-to-end planning with human driving cognition, using popular driving models as baselines on publicly available autonomous driving datasets. Both open-loop and closed-loop tests are conducted for a comprehensive evaluation of planning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the $E^{3}AD$ paradigm significantly enhances the end-to-end planning performance of baseline models. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of driving cognition and the effectiveness of comparative learning process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate human driving cognition for improving end-to-end autonomous driving planning. It represents an initial attempt to incorporate embodied cognitive data into end-to-end autonomous driving, providing valuable insights for future brain-inspired autonomous driving systems. Our code will be made available at Github</p></details> | 24 pages,4 pages | None |
| **[DepthVanish: Optimizing Adversarial Interval Structures for Stereo-Depth-Invisible Patches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16690v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant) can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous works have shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these naively repeated textures perform poorly in physical implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical utility for stress-testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals among the repeated textures, creating a grid structure, significantly enhances the patch's attack performance. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of this novel structure influence the adversarial effectiveness. Based on these insights, we develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the interval structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be inserted into any scenes and successfully attack advanced stereo depth estimation methods of different paradigms, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of stereo systems.

| **[Layer-Wise Modality Decomposition for Interpretable Multimodal Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00859v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, transparency in the decision-making of perception models is critical, as even a single misperception can be catastrophic. Yet with multi-sensor inputs, it is difficult to determine how each modality contributes to a prediction because sensor information becomes entangled within the fusion network. We introduce Layer-Wise Modality Decomposition (LMD), a post-hoc, model-agnostic interpretability method that disentangles modality-specific information across all layers of a pretrained fusion model. To our knowledge, LMD is the first approach to attribute the predictions of a perception model to individual input modalities in a sensor-fusion system for autonomous driving. We evaluate LMD on pretrained fusion models under camera-radar, camera-LiDAR, and camera-radar-LiDAR settings for autonomous driving. Its effectiveness is validated using structured perturbation-based metrics and modality-wise visual decompositions, demonstrating practical applicability to interpreting high-capacity multimodal architectures.

| **[Co-MTP: A Cooperative Trajectory Prediction Framework with Multi-Temporal Fusion for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16589v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[D$^2$GS: Dense Depth Regularization for LiDAR-free Urban Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25173v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs, \textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose D$^2$GS, a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency. $\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians. In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unveiling Uniform Shifted Power Law in Stochastic Human and Autonomous Driving Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00659v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately simulating rare but safety-critical driving behaviors is essential for the evaluation and certification of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, current models often fail to reproduce realistic collision rates when calibrated on real-world data, largely due to inadequate representation of long-tailed behavioral distributions. Here, we uncover a simple yet unifying shifted power law that robustly characterizes the stochasticity of both human-driven vehicle (HV) and AV behaviors, especially in the long-tail regime. The model adopts a parsimonious analytical form with only one or two parameters, enabling efficient calibration even under data sparsity. Analyzing large-scale, micro-level trajectory data from global HV and AV datasets, the shifted power law achieves an average R2 of 0.97 and a nearly identical tail distribution, uniformly fits both frequent behaviors and rare safety-critical deviations, significantly outperforming existing Gaussian-based baselines. When integrated into an agent-based traffic simulator, it enables forward-rolling simulations that reproduce realistic crash patterns for both HVs and AVs, achieving rates consistent with real-world statistics and improving the fidelity of safety assessment without post hoc correction. This discovery offers a unified and data-efficient foundation for modeling high-risk behavior and improves the fidelity of simulation-based safety assessments for mixed AV/HV traffic. The shifted power law provides a promising path toward simulation-driven validation and global certification of AV technologies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dynamic Model Selection for Trajectory Prediction via Pairwise Ranking and Meta-Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00126v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep trajectory predictors (e.g., Jiang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2022) have achieved strong average accuracy but remain unreliable in complex long-tail driving scenarios. These limitations reveal the weakness of the prevailing "one-model-fits-all" paradigm, particularly in safety-critical urban contexts where simpler physics-based models can occasionally outperform advanced networks (Kalman, 1960). To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamic multi-expert gating framework that adaptively selects the most reliable trajectory predictor among a physics-informed LSTM, a Transformer, and a fine-tuned GameFormer on a per-sample basis. Our method leverages internal model signals (meta-features) such as stability and uncertainty (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), which we demonstrate to be substantially more informative than geometric scene descriptors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate trajectory expert selection as a pairwise-ranking problem over internal model signals (Burges et al., 2005), directly optimizing decision quality without requiring post-hoc calibration. Evaluated on the nuPlan-mini dataset (Caesar et al., 2021) with 1,287 samples, our LLM-enhanced tri-expert gate achieves a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 2.567 m, representing a 9.5 percent reduction over GameFormer (2.835 m), and realizes 57.8 percent of the oracle performance bound. In open-loop simulations, after trajectory horizon alignment, the same configuration reduces FDE on left-turn scenarios by approximately 10 percent, demonstrating consistent improvements across both offline validation and open-loop evaluation. These results indicate that adaptive hybrid systems enhance trajectory reliability in safety-critical autonomous driving, providing a practical pathway beyond static single-model paradigms.</p></details> |  | None |

The pipeline significantly reduces the computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation. Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to $3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Modified-Emergency Index (MEI): A Criticality Metric for Autonomous Driving in Lateral Conflict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27333v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective, reliable, and efficient evaluation of autonomous driving safety is essential to demonstrate its trustworthiness. Criticality metrics provide an objective means of assessing safety. However, as existing metrics primarily target longitudinal conflicts, accurately quantifying the risks of lateral conflicts - prevalent in urban settings - remains challenging. This paper proposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify evasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index (EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers, enabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral conflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500 high-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events. MEI is then compared with the well-established ACT and the widely used PET metrics. Results show that MEI consistently outperforms them in accurately quantifying criticality and capturing risk evolution. Overall, these findings highlight MEI as a promising metric for evaluating urban conflicts and enhancing the safety assessment framework for autonomous driving.

To address these issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution Segmentation (PanOoS), with the aim of achieving comprehensive and safe scene understanding. Furthermore, we propose the first solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images through text-guided prompt distribution learning. Specifically, POS integrates a disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain generalization capability of CLIP. The proposed Prompt-based Restoration Attention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and self-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL) refines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype supervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we establish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex environments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic annular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of POS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS, outperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods. Moreover, POS achieves leading closed-set segmentation capabilities and advances the development of panoramic understanding.

Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful transition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real transfer methods struggle to address the autonomy-oriented requirements of balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust performance with limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain representations, and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain points, we present a unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive representations through conditional latent diffusion for sim2real transferable automated driving. Our framework offers options to leverage: (i) alternate foundation models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and (iii) textual as well as image prompts for mapping across given source and target domains. It is also capable of generating diverse high-quality samples when diffusing across parameter spaces such as times of day, weather conditions, seasons, and operational design domains. We systematically analyze the presented framework and report our findings in terms of performance benchmarks and ablation studies. Additionally, we demonstrate its serviceability for autonomous driving using behavioral cloning case studies. Our experiments indicate that the proposed framework is capable of bridging the perceptual sim2real gap by over 40%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> | None |
| **[Alpamayo-R1: Bridging Reasoning and Action Prediction for Generalizable Autonomous Driving in the Long Tail](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00088v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end architectures trained via imitation learning have advanced autonomous driving by scaling model size and data, yet performance remains brittle in safety-critical long-tail scenarios where supervision is sparse and causal understanding is limited. To address this, we introduce Alpamayo-R1 (AR1), a vision-language-action model (VLA) that integrates Chain of Causation reasoning with trajectory planning to enhance decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) the Chain of Causation (CoC) dataset, built through a hybrid auto-labeling and human-in-the-loop pipeline producing decision-grounded, causally linked reasoning traces aligned with driving behaviors; (2) a modular VLA architecture combining Cosmos-Reason, a Vision-Language Model pre-trained for Physical AI applications, with a diffusion-based trajectory decoder that generates dynamically feasible plans in real time; (3) a multi-stage training strategy using supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize reasoning quality via large reasoning model feedback and enforce reasoning-action consistency. Evaluation shows AR1 achieves up to a 12% improvement in planning accuracy on challenging cases compared to a trajectory-only baseline, with a 35% reduction in off-road rate and 25% reduction in close encounter rate in closed-loop simulation. RL post-training improves reasoning quality by 45% as measured by a large reasoning model critic and reasoning-action consistency by 37%. Model scaling from 0.5B to 7B parameters shows consistent improvements. On-vehicle road tests confirm real-time performance (99 ms latency) and successful urban deployment. By bridging interpretable reasoning with precise control, AR1 demonstrates a practical path towards Level 4 autonomous driving. We plan to release AR1 models and a subset of the CoC in a future update.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AD-SAM: Fine-Tuning the Segment Anything Vision Foundation Model for Autonomous Driving Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27047v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention. Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM, Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes, respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a 0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models enable reliable and scalable AD perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (IEEE T-ITS)</p></details> | None |

However, prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly, CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and was honored with the Innovation Award.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neurosymbolic Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13138v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract, thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols. Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Self-localization based on a camera often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets. Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WOD-E2E: Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving in Challenging Long-tail Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26125v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.</p></details> |  | None |

Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Atlas Graphs for Dynamic Scene Decomposition and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16336v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning editable high-resolution scene representations for dynamic scenes is an open problem with applications across the domains from autonomous driving to creative editing - the most successful approaches today make a trade-off between editability and supporting scene complexity: neural atlases represent dynamic scenes as two deforming image layers, foreground and background, which are editable in 2D, but break down when multiple objects occlude and interact. In contrast, scene graph models make use of annotated data such as masks and bounding boxes from autonomous-driving datasets to capture complex 3D spatial relationships, but their implicit volumetric node representations are challenging to edit view-consistently. We propose Neural Atlas Graphs (NAGs), a hybrid high-resolution scene representation, where every graph node is a view-dependent neural atlas, facilitating both 2D appearance editing and 3D ordering and positioning of scene elements. Fit at test-time, NAGs achieve state-of-the-art quantitative results on the Waymo Open Dataset - by 5 dB PSNR increase compared to existing methods - and make environmental editing possible in high resolution and visual quality - creating counterfactual driving scenarios with new backgrounds and edited vehicle appearance. We find that the method also generalizes beyond driving scenes and compares favorably - by more than 7 dB in PSNR - to recent matting and video editing baselines on the DAVIS video dataset with a diverse set of human and animal-centric scenes.

However, the lack of quality datasets hinders research and development. We report a new method that is able to simulate 4D millimeter wave radar signals including pitch, yaw, range, and Doppler velocity along with radar signal strength (RSS) using camera image, light detection and ranging (lidar) point cloud, and ego-velocity. The method is based on two new neural networks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of radar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on appearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method using open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The experimental results show that our method can successfully generate high-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object detection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar. The network outperforms the counterpart trained only on raw radar data, a promising result to facilitate future radar-based research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17685v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly used for end-to-end driving due to their world knowledge and reasoning ability. Most prior work, however, inserts textual chains-of-thought (CoT) as intermediate steps tailored to the current scene. Such symbolic compressions can blur spatio-temporal relations and discard fine visual cues, creating a cross-modal gap between perception and planning. We propose FSDrive, a visual spatio-temporal CoT framework that enables VLAs to think in images. The model first acts as a world model to generate a unified future frame that overlays coarse but physically-plausible priors-future lane dividers and 3D boxes-on the predicted future image. This unified frame serves as the visual CoT, capturing both spatial structure and temporal evolution. The same VLA then functions as an inverse-dynamics model, planning trajectories from current observations and the visual CoT. To equip VLAs with image generation while preserving understanding, we introduce a unified pre-training paradigm that expands the vocabulary to include visual tokens and jointly optimizes VQA (for semantics) and future-frame prediction (for dynamics). A progressive easy-to-hard scheme first predicts lane/box priors to enforce physical constraints, then completes full future frames for fine details. On nuScenes and NAVSIM, FSDrive improves trajectory accuracy and reduces collisions under both ST-P3 and UniAD metrics, and attains competitive FID for future-frame generation despite using lightweight autoregression. It also advances scene understanding on DriveLM. Together, these results indicate that visual CoT narrows the cross-modal gap and yields safer, more anticipatory planning.

We systematically explore techniques ranging from logic-based frameworks to computational legal reasoning approaches, emphasizing their capability to ensure regulatory compliance and interpretability in dynamic and uncertain driving environments. A central finding is that significant challenges arise at the intersection of perceptual reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability. To systematically analyze these challenges, we introduce a taxonomy categorizing existing approaches by their theoretical foundations, architectural implementations, and validation strategies. We particularly focus on methods that address perceptual uncertainty and incorporate explicit legal norms, facilitating decisions that are both technically robust and legally defensible. The review covers neural-symbolic integration methods for perception, logic-driven rule representation, and norm-aware prediction strategies, all contributing toward transparent and accountable autonomous vehicle operation. We highlight critical open questions and practical trade-offs that must be addressed, offering multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law to guide future developments in legally compliant autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC)</p></details> | None |

However, prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SenSys 2026</p></details> | None |

While recent advances have made impressive progress, most methods still unify all background elements into a single representation, hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the 3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are available at our project page.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification, quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However, these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework, called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning. Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by 3.9% to 8.5%</p></details> | <details><summary>It wa...</summary><p>It was accepted by ICDE2026</p></details> | None |

However, current urban scene reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs, \textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency. $\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians. In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present SCD-Bench (Safety Cognition Driving Benchmark) a novel framework specifically designed to assess the safety cognition capabilities of VLMs within interactive driving scenarios. To address the scalability challenge of data annotation, we introduce ADA (Autonomous Driving Annotation), a semi-automated labeling system, further refined through expert review by professionals with domain-specific knowledge in autonomous driving. To facilitate scalable and consistent evaluation, we also propose an automated assessment pipeline leveraging large language models, which demonstrates over 98% agreement with human expert judgments. In addressing the broader challenge of aligning VLMs with safety cognition in driving environments, we construct SCD-Training, the first large-scale dataset tailored for this task, comprising 324.35K high-quality samples. Through extensive experiments, we show that models trained on SCD-Training exhibit marked improvements not only on SCD-Bench, but also on general and domain-specific benchmarks, offering a new perspective on enhancing safety-aware interactions in vision-language systems for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Explainability is vital for users' trust calibration, but explainable MAS face challenges due to complex environments, the human factor, and non-standardised evaluation. Leveraging the counterfactual effect size model and LLMs, we propose Agentic eXplanations via Interrogative Simulation (AXIS). AXIS generates human-centred action explanations for multi-agent policies by having an LLM interrogate an environment simulator using prompts like 'whatif' and 'remove' to observe and synthesise counterfactual information over multiple rounds. We evaluate AXIS on autonomous driving across ten scenarios for five LLMs with a comprehensive methodology combining robustness, subjective preference, correctness, and goal/action prediction with an external LLM as evaluator. Compared to baselines, AXIS improves perceived explanation correctness by at least 7.7% across all models and goal prediction accuracy by 23% for four models, with comparable action prediction accuracy, achieving the highest scores overall.

These approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT (Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process, learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios, demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Delay Tolerant Control for Autonomous Driving Using CDOB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24898v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of autonomous vehicle technologies, effective path-tracking control has become a critical component in ensuring safety and efficiency in complex traffic scenarios. When a high level decision making agent generates a collision free path, a robust low level controller is required to precisely follow this trajectory. However, connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) are inherently affected by communication delays and computation delays, which significantly degrade the performance of conventional controllers such as PID or other more advanced controllers like disturbance observers (DOB). While DOB-based designs have shown effectiveness in rejecting disturbances under nominal conditions, their performance deteriorates considerably in the presence of unknown time delays. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a delay-tolerant communication disturbance observer (CDOB) framework for path-tracking control in delayed systems. The proposed CDOB compensates for the adverse effects of time delays, maintaining accurate trajectory tracking even under uncertain and varying delay conditions. It is shown through a simulation study that the proposed control architecture maintains close alignment with the reference trajectory across various scenarios, including single lane change, double-= lane change, and Elastic Band generated collision avoidance paths under various time delays. Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches in both tracking accuracy and delay robustness, making it well suited for autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning to Drive Safely with Hybrid Options](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24674v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore, in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies over actions.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a systematic framework built on four core components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing, Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature, top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks.

Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data. ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM (simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on HUGSIM.

Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods predominantly adopt either attention-based flatten fusion or bird's eye view fusion through geometric transformations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited interpretability or dense computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce GaussianFusion, a Gaussian-based multi-sensor fusion framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our method employs intuitive and compact Gaussian representations as intermediate carriers to aggregate information from diverse sensors. Specifically, we initialize a set of 2D Gaussians uniformly across the driving scene, where each Gaussian is parameterized by physical attributes and equipped with explicit and implicit features. These Gaussians are progressively refined by integrating multi-modal features. The explicit features capture rich semantic and spatial information about the traffic scene, while the implicit features provide complementary cues beneficial for trajectory planning. To fully exploit rich spatial and semantic information in Gaussians, we design a cascade planning head that iteratively refines trajectory predictions through interactions with Gaussians. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed GaussianFusion framework. The source code will be released at https://github.com/Say2L/GaussianFusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Say2L/GaussianFusion) |
| **[Modeling and Scheduling of Fusion Patterns in Autonomous Driving Systems (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23895v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are widely used to model complex data dependencies and inter-task communication. However, existing DAG scheduling approaches oversimplify data fusion tasks by assuming fixed triggering mechanisms, failing to capture the diverse fusion patterns found in real-world ADS software stacks. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for analyzing various fusion patterns and their performance implications in ADS. Our framework models three distinct fusion task types: timer-triggered, wait-for-all, and immediate fusion, which comprehensively represent real-world fusion behaviors. Our Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based approach enables an optimization of multiple real-time performance metrics, including reaction time, time disparity, age of information, and response time, while generating deterministic offline schedules directly applicable to real platforms. Evaluation using real-world ADS case studies, Raspberry Pi implementation, and randomly generated DAGs demonstrates that our framework handles diverse fusion patterns beyond the scope of existing work, and achieves substantial performance improvements in comparable scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints, enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Neural Stereo Video Compression with Hybrid Disparity Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20383v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disparity compensation represents the primary strategy in stereo video compression (SVC) for exploiting cross-view redundancy. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal shifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to reduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid disparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel displacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform implicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby capturing a broader range of disparity information. Specifically, HDC first computes a similarity map by fusing the horizontally shifted cross-view features to capture pixel displacement information. This similarity map is then normalized into an "explicit pixel-wise attention score" to perform the cross-attention mechanism, implicitly aligning features from one view to another. Building upon HDC, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimized neural stereo video compression framework, which integrates HDC-based modules into key coding operations, including cross-view feature extraction and reconstruction (HDC-FER) and cross-view entropy modeling (HDC-EM). Extensive experiments on SVC benchmarks, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Nagoya, which cover both autonomous driving and general scenes, demonstrate that our framework outperforms both neural and traditional SVC methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark. Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation, and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value in downstream tasks.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of GenAI in automotive, highlighting enabling technologies such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders. Key opportunities include accelerating autonomous driving validation through synthetic data generation, optimizing component design, and enhancing human machine interaction via personalized and adaptive interfaces. At the same time, the paper identifies significant technical, ethical, and safety challenges, including computational demands, bias, intellectual property concerns, and adversarial robustness, that must be addressed for responsible deployment. A case study on Mercedes Benzs MBUX Virtual Assistant illustrates how GenAI powered voice systems deliver more natural, proactive, and personalized in car interactions compared to legacy rule based assistants. Through this review and case study, the paper outlines both the promise and limitations of GenAI integration in the automotive sector and presents directions for future research and development aimed at achieving safer, more efficient, and user centric mobility.

| **[Uncertainty-Aware Autonomous Vehicles: Predicting the Road Ahead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22680v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems have advanced rapidly in recent years, providing vehicles with the ability to accurately interpret their environment. Perception systems remain susceptible to errors caused by overly-confident predictions in the case of rare events or out-of-sample data. This study equips an autonomous vehicle with the ability to 'know when it is uncertain', using an uncertainty-aware image classifier as part of the AV software stack. Specifically, the study exploits the ability of Random-Set Neural Networks (RS-NNs) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty. Unlike traditional CNNs or Bayesian methods, RS-NNs predict belief functions over sets of classes, allowing the system to identify and signal uncertainty clearly in novel or ambiguous scenarios. The system is tested in a real-world autonomous racing vehicle software stack, with the RS-NN classifying the layout of the road ahead and providing the associated uncertainty of the prediction. Performance of the RS-NN under a range of road conditions is compared against traditional CNN and Bayesian neural networks, with the RS-NN achieving significantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration. This integration of RS-NNs into Robot Operating System (ROS)-based vehicle control pipeline demonstrates that predictive uncertainty can dynamically modulate vehicle speed, maintaining high-speed performance under confident predictions while proactively improving safety through speed reductions in uncertain scenarios. These results demonstrate the potential of uncertainty-aware neural networks - in particular RS-NNs - as a practical solution for safer and more robust autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year and has been open-sourced.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 | None |

However, current methods perform poorly in high quality predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and schedules.

However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings.

The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our synthetic data with actual snowy conditions.

The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second (FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy.

| **[HARMONY: Hidden Activation Representations and Model Output-Aware Uncertainty Estimation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22171v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions, aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA, VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and 6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for VLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, applying RL to end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Most existing approaches treat RGB and infrared modalities equally. They typically adopt two symmetrical backbones for multimodal feature extraction, which ignore the substantial differences between modalities and bring great difficulty for the reduction of the computational cost as well as effective crossmodal fusion. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient framework named Wavelet-context Cooperative Network (WCCNet) that is able to differentially extract complementary features of different spectra with lower computational complexity, and further fuse these diverse features based on their spatially relevant crossmodal semantics. In particular, WCCNet simultaneously explore wavelet context and RGB textures within a cooperative dual-stream backbone, which is composed of adaptive discrete wavelet transform (ADWT) layers and heavyweight neural layers. The ADWT layers extract frequency components for infrared modality, while neural layers handle RGB modality features. Since ADWT layers are lightweight and extract complementary features, this cooperative structure not only significantly reduces the computational complexity, but also facilitates the subsequent crossmodal fusion. To further fuse these infrared and RGB features with significant semantic differences, we elaborately design the crossmodal rearranging fusion module (CMRF), which can mitigate spatial misalignment and merge semantically complementary features in spatially-related local regions to amplify the crossmodal reciprocal information. Experimental results on KAIST and FLIR benchmarks indicate that WCCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with considerable efficiency and competitive accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures | None |

Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis. However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a constraint function that classifies the states of the system under consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.</p></details> |  | None |

DL models support perception modules, equipped with tasks such as object detection and sensor fusion. These DL models enable vehicles to process multi-sensor inputs to understand complex surroundings. Deploying DL models in autonomous driving systems faces stringent challenges, including real-time processing, limited computational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these challenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to optimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique quality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as crashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation. Unfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these quality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as these models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor processing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature extraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which existing testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates test input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by assembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities required by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and updates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting, mutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to enrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the autonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential testing.</p></details> |  | None |

A crucial part of multi-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer from high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an association algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a multidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their spatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and a realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood associations in ambiguous settings.</p></details> |  | None |

We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured, grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text, SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench, a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | None |

Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height, and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes. Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes, and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing models often underperform in these situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics, and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in fully AVs.</p></details> |  | None |

AI systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks (e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets, protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a model server.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing autonomous driving datasets inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference. By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a major obstacle to model generalization. To address this challenge from a data-centric perspective, this paper introduces a profile extraction and discovery framework for characterizing the style profiles underlying both synthetic and real image datasets. We propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized profiling-based quality control paradigm that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |

Especially in the face of adversarial attacks, DRL may suffer serious performance degradation or even make potentially dangerous decisions, so it is crucial to ensure their stability in security-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce the basic framework of DRL and analyze the main security challenges faced in complex and changing environments. In addition, this paper proposes an adversarial attack classification framework based on perturbation type and attack target and reviews the mainstream adversarial attack methods against DRL in detail, including various attack methods such as perturbation state space, action space, reward function and model space. To effectively counter the attacks, this paper systematically summarizes various current robustness training strategies, including adversarial training, competitive training, robust learning, adversarial detection, defense distillation and other related defense techniques, we also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these methods in improving the robustness of DRL. Finally, this paper looks into the future research direction of DRL in adversarial environments, emphasizing the research needs in terms of improving generalization, reducing computational complexity, and enhancing scalability and explainability, aiming to provide valuable references and directions for researchers.</p></details> |  | None |

These risks could lead to the attacks including user behavior recognition, sensitive location inference and trajectory reconstruction. In order to mitigate the data security risk caused by the automotive location sharing, this paper proposes a high-precision privacy protection mechanism based on format-preserving encryption (FPE) of geographical coordinates. The automotive coordinate data key mapping mechanism is designed to reduce to the accuracy loss of the geographical location data caused by the repeated encryption and decryption. The experimental results demonstrate that the average relative distance retention rate (RDR) reached 0.0844, and the number of hotspots in the critical area decreased by 98.9% after encryption. To evaluate the accuracy loss of the proposed encryption algorithm on automotive geographical location data, this paper presents the experimental analysis of decryption accuracy, and the result indicates that the decrypted coordinate data achieves a restoration accuracy of 100%. This work presents a high-precision privacy protection method for automotive location data, thereby providing an efficient data security solution for the sensitive data sharing in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods rely on keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware." Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for advancing cross-view geo-localization research.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure. 6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles, but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper Award at the Embedded Vision Workshop ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Due to the surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |

While Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS, existing methods rely heavily on manual effort and lack automation. We present AutoMT, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic rules and the generation of valid follow-up test cases. AutoMT leverages LLMs to extract MRs from traffic rules in Gherkin syntax using a predefined ontology. A vision-language agent analyzes scenarios, and a search agent retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up cases via computer vision. Experiments show that AutoMT achieves up to 5 x higher test diversity in follow-up case generation compared to the best baseline (manual expert-defined MRs) in terms of validation rate, and detects up to 20.55% more behavioral violations. While manual MT relies on a fixed set of predefined rules, AutoMT automatically extracts diverse metamorphic relations that augment real-world datasets and help uncover corner cases often missed during in-field testing and data collection. Its modular architecture separating MR extraction, filtering, and test generation supports integration into industrial pipelines and potentially enables simulation-based testing to systematically cover underrepresented or safety-critical scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods relying on hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution, and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models": deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research and applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies have demonstrated that imitation learning-based planners and learning-based trajectory scorers can effectively generate and select safety trajectories that closely mimic expert demonstrations. However, such trajectory planners and scorers face the challenge of generating temporally inconsistent and uncomfortable trajectories. To address these issues, ComDrive first extracts 3D spatial representations through sparse perception, which then serves as conditional inputs. These inputs are used by a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)-based motion planner to generate temporally consistent multi-modal trajectories. A dual-stream adaptive trajectory scorer subsequently selects the most comfortable trajectory from these candidates to control the vehicle. Experiments demonstrate that ComDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both comfort and safety, outperforming UniAD by 17% in driving comfort and reducing collision rates by 25% compared to SparseDrive.

As an emerging sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection, and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features. Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft (VoD) object detection benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |

Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are $\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

In Phase-1, a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains) further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception, prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example, using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to 66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing autonomous driving datasets inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference. By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.</p></details> |  | None |

While miniaturized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platforms have emerged as a promising solution, a systematic framework supporting rigorous quantitative analysis is generally lacking, limiting their value as scientific evaluation tools. To address this challenge, we propose MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized testing from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative analysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic three-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended Functionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the performance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning systems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a unified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring consistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through comprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of approximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged this validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a critical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms. This work shows that a structured process, combined with a platform offering a unified spatio-temporal benchmark, enables reproducible, interpretable, and quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It creates a feedback loop where the agent's performance influences the generation of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent. However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how can we train an adversarial cooperator? We propose a novel strategy that combines a pretrained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies where the learning policy, the Cooperator agent, underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state of the art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.</p></details> |  | None |

This report presents our winning solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV 2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints, providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing models, however, are typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences, imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes. However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary \textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose RAD, a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for end-to-end Autonomous Driving. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards to guide the policy in effectively responding to safety-critical events and understanding real-world causal relationships. To better align with human driving behavior, we incorporate IL into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, particularly exhibiting a 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented in the supplementary material.

Current methods trained solely on synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects. We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains. We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans. Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.</p></details> | Under Review | [Code Link](https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP) |

To support this growth, cloud providers offer ML services to ease the integration of ML components in software systems. The evolving business requirements and the popularity of ML services have led practitioners of all skill levels to implement, and maintain ML service-based systems. However, they may not always adhere to optimal design and usage practices for ML cloud services, resulting in common misuse which could significantly degrade the quality of ML service-based systems and adversely affect their maintenance and evolution. Though much research has been conducted on ML service misuse, a consistent terminology and specification for these misuses remain absent. We therefore conduct in this paper a comprehensive, multi-vocal empirical study exploring the prevalence of ML cloud service misuses in practice. We propose a catalog of 20 ML cloud service misuses, most of which have not been studied in prior research. To achieve this, we conducted a) a systematic literature review of studies on ML misuses, b) a gray literature review of the official documentation provided by major cloud providers, c) an empirical analysis of a curated set of 377 ML service-based systems on GitHub, and d) a survey with 50 ML practitioners. Our results show that ML service misuses are common in both open-source projects and industry, often stemming from a lack of understanding of service capabilities, and insufficient documentation. This emphasizes the importance of ongoing education in best practices for ML services, which is the focus of this paper, while also highlighting the need for tools to automatically detect and refactor ML misuses.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spacer-ai.github.io/</p></details> | None |

While Vision Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce 4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread. The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate 4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

This could revolutionize applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. However, before treating these models as world models, we must ask: Do they adhere to physical conservation laws? To answer this, we introduce Morpheus, a benchmark for evaluating video generation models on physical reasoning. It features 80 real-world videos capturing physical phenomena, guided by conservation laws. Since artificial generations lack ground truth, we assess physical plausibility using physics-informed metrics evaluated with respect to infallible conservation laws known per physical setting, leveraging advances in physics-informed neural networks and vision-language foundation models. Our findings reveal that even with advanced prompting and video conditioning, current models struggle to encode physical principles despite generating aesthetically pleasing videos.

To address this, we propose Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance, while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt.

However, how a language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions. First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities, critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned, trustworthy LLM explanations.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited 3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their complementary strengths.

However, their large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding, which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet</p></details> |  | None |

The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.</p></details> |  | None |

Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances.

To bridge this gap, we present ORAD-3D, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest dataset specifically curated for off-road autonomous driving. ORAD-3D covers a wide spectrum of terrains, including woodlands, farmlands, grasslands, riversides, gravel roads, cement roads, and rural areas, while capturing diverse environmental variations across weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, and snowy) and illumination levels (bright daylight, daytime, twilight, and nighttime). Building upon this dataset, we establish a comprehensive suite of benchmark evaluations spanning five fundamental tasks: 2D free-space detection, 3D occupancy prediction, rough GPS-guided path planning, vision-language model-driven autonomous driving, and world model for off-road environments. Together, the dataset and benchmarks provide a unified and robust resource for advancing perception and planning in challenging off-road scenarios. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/chaytonmin/ORAD-3D.</p></details> | Off-road robotics | [Code Link](https://github.com/chaytonmin/ORAD-3D) |

Although traditional object detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition, we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.</p></details> | Neurocomputing | None |

Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ICCV 2025 2nd Workshop on the Challenge Of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL)</p></details> | None |

Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object detection through object specific transformations at both training and inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic, diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and inference respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 Workshops</p></details> | None |

| **[Perfect Prediction or Plenty of Proposals? What Matters Most in Planning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15505v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[VDRive: Leveraging Reinforced VLA and Diffusion Policy for End-to-end Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15446v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</p></details> | 1st version | None |
| **[FreqPDE: Rethinking Positional Depth Embedding for Multi-View 3D Object Detection Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15385v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism. Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and 3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 | None |

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and overcoming occlusions, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous driving. In recent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged; however, these datasets primarily focus on cameras and LiDAR, neglecting 4D Radar, a sensor used in single-vehicle autonomous driving to provide robust perception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap created by the absence of 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we present V2X-Radar, the first large-scale, real-world multi-modal dataset featuring 4D Radar. V2X-Radar dataset is collected using a connected vehicle platform and an intelligent roadside unit equipped with 4D Radar, LiDAR, and multi-view cameras. The collected data encompasses sunny and rainy weather conditions, spanning daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as various typical challenging scenarios. The dataset consists of 20K LiDAR frames, 40K camera images, and 20K 4D Radar data, including 350K annotated boxes across five categories. To support various research domains, we have established V2X-Radar-C for cooperative perception, V2X-Radar-I for roadside perception, and V2X-Radar-V for single-vehicle perception. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive benchmarks across these three sub-datasets.

LiDAR-generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's-eye view for the scene representation, enabling self-supervised joint scene predictions while exhibiting resilience to partial observability and perception detection failures. Prior approaches have focused on deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures within the grid cell space. While these methods have seen some success, they frequently produce unrealistic predictions and fail to capture the stochastic nature of the environment. Additionally, they do not effectively integrate additional sensor modalities present in AVs. Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction (LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a generative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and planned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder, which provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based batch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal consistency issues and reduce compression losses. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets show that all variants of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperform prior approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[WorldSplat: Gaussian-Centric Feed-Forward 4D Scene Generation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23402v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose WorldSplat, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: (i) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. (ii) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WorldSplat effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00709v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

Scenic, a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs) suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14 prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics (compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11). EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88 percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting, Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options for autonomous-driving scenario programming.</p></details> |  | None |

In order to improve the robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial attack, such as state observation attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art.

These large-scale datasets are often dominated by common environmental conditions such as "Clear and Day" weather, leading to decreased performance in under-represented conditions like "Rainy and Night". To address this issue, we introduce SynDiff-AD, a novel data augmentation pipeline that leverages diffusion models (DMs) to generate realistic images for such subgroups. SynDiff-AD uses ControlNet-a DM that guides data generation conditioned on semantic maps-along with a novel prompting scheme that generates subgroup-specific, semantically dense prompts. By augmenting datasets with SynDiff-AD, we improve the performance of segmentation models like Mask2Former and SegFormer by up to 1.2% and 2.3% on the Waymo dataset, and up to 1.4% and 0.7% on the DeepDrive dataset, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that our SynDiff-AD pipeline enhances the driving performance of end-to-end autonomous driving models, like AIM-2D and AIM-BEV, by up to 20% across diverse environmental conditions in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, providing a more robust model.

Nevertheless, most methods often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively. Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios. The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation (DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI) loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> | None |

| **[Partitioned Scheduling for DAG Tasks Considering Probabilistic Execution Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13279v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems, critical for safety, require real-time guarantees and can be modeled as DAGs. Their acceleration features, such as caches and pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack (SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance. We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces Hi-Drive, a hierarchical planning algorithm addressing uncertainties at both behavior and trajectory levels using a hierarchical Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation. Hi-Drive employs driver models to represent uncertain behavioral intentions of other vehicles and uses their parameters to infer hidden driving styles. By treating driver models as high-level decision-making actions, our approach effectively manages the exponential complexity inherent in POMDPs. To further enhance safety and robustness, Hi-Drive integrates a trajectory optimization based on importance sampling, refining trajectories using a comprehensive analysis of critical agents. Evaluations on real-world urban driving datasets demonstrate that Hi-Drive significantly outperforms state-of-the-art planning-based and learning-based methods across diverse urban driving situations in real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

The research community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles (AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models' performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e., SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.) still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892, truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values, confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 14 figures | None |

Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in 2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI benchmark.

To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Safe Driving in Occluded Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13114v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safe autonomous driving in the presence of occlusions poses a significant challenge in its policy design. While existing model-driven control techniques based on set invariance can handle visible risks, occlusions create latent risks in which safety-critical states are not observable. Data-driven techniques also struggle to handle latent risks because direct mappings from risk-critical objects in sensor inputs to safe actions cannot be learned without visible risk-critical objects. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic safety certificate for latent risk. Our key technical enabler is the application of probabilistic invariance: It relaxes the strict observability requirements imposed by set-invariance methods that demand the knowledge of risk-critical states. The proposed techniques provide linear action constraints that confine the latent risk probability within tolerance. Such constraints can be integrated into model predictive controllers or embedded in data-driven policies to mitigate latent risks. The proposed method is tested using the CARLA simulator and compared with a few existing techniques. The theoretical and empirical analysis jointly demonstrate that the proposed methods assure long-term safety in real-time control in occluded environments without being overly conservative and with transparency to exposed risks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context. Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation to evaluating autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures | None |

Consequently, obstacle detection latency is critical to the safety and effectiveness of autonomous driving systems. However, the latency of the obstacle detection module and its resilience to various changes in the LiDAR point cloud data are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive investigation on measuring and modeling the performance of the obstacle detection modules in two industry-grade autonomous driving systems, i.e., Apollo and Autoware. Learning from this investigation, we introduce ADPerf, a tool that aims to generate realistic point cloud data test cases that can expose increased detection latency. Increasing latency decreases the availability of the detected obstacles and stresses the capabilities of subsequent modules in autonomous driving systems, i.e., the modules may be negatively impacted by the increased latency in obstacle detection. We applied ADPerf to stress-test the performance of widely used 3D obstacle detection modules in autonomous driving systems, as well as the propagation of such tests on trajectory prediction modules. Our evaluation highlights the need to conduct performance testing of obstacle detection components, especially 3D obstacle detection, as they can be a major bottleneck to increased latency of the autonomous driving system. Such an adverse outcome will also further propagate to other modules, reducing the overall reliability of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> | None |

This requires building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data. Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/simuli</p></details> | None |

However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> | None |

The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> | None |

To achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent decision-making framework in complex scenarios.

However, existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion. CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.</p></details> |  | None |

This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects, while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS.</p></details> |  | None |

Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the first time, angle-based perception was introduced into the multi-modality image fusion task</p></details> | None |

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving.

While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa) |

The COOOL benchmark targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies, and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models (VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events.

| **[StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01875v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has been utilized in numerous robotic applications due to its appealing characteristics to solve non-convex optimization problems. However, the stochastic nature of sampling-based methods can cause significant chattering in the resulting commands. Chattering becomes more prominent in cases where the environment changes rapidly, possibly even causing the MPPI to diverge. To address this issue, we propose a method that seamlessly combines MPPI with an input-lifting strategy. In addition, we introduce a new action cost to smooth control sequence during trajectory rollouts while preserving the information theoretic interpretation of MPPI, which was derived from non-affine dynamics. We validate our method in two nonlinear control tasks with neural network dynamics: a pendulum swing-up task and a challenging autonomous driving task. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the MPPI baselines with additionally applied smoothing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (and IROS 2022).

| **[Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08045v5)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  | None |

For these vehicles, as well as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics. In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICAR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant (de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering, liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows 95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from 521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h) on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Data Scaling Laws for Imitation Learning-Based End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02689v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm has recently attracted lots of attention due to its scalability. However, existing methods are constrained by the limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration of the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address this issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and behaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing imitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically, approximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were gathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We performed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400 diverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop) under stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we discovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law relationship with the amount of data, but this is not the case in closed-loop evaluation. The inconsistency between the two assessments shifts our focus toward the distribution of data rather than merely expanding its volume. (2) a small increase in the quantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the corresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to achieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions. Our results highlight the critical role of data scaling in improving the generalizability of models across diverse autonomous driving scenarios, assuring safe deployment in the real world..

| **[Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11092v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |
| **[Flow Matching-Based Autonomous Driving Planning with Advanced Interactive Behavior Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11083v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models, removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation, which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures.

We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.</p></details> | 5 pages | None |
| **[Game-Theoretic Risk-Shaped Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10960v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety, efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L) framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate, collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency.

| **[Neutral Agent-based Adversarial Policy Learning against Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-party Open Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and dependent on interactions with victim agents. To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Since vehicles always cruise in highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy, while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous driving systems.

Traditionally, difficult scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually. However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset.

However, their behavior is often governed by a cost function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning for broader autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to the IEEE ICRA 2026, Vienna, Austria</p></details> | None |

Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and 66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM planners.</p></details> |  | None |

This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Risk-Budgeted Control Framework for Balanced Performance and Safety in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10442v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a risk-budgeted monitor with a control framework that certifies safety for autonomous driving. In this process, a sliding window is proposed to monitor for insufficient barrier residuals or nonzero tail risk, ensuring system safety. When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers switching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control barrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF) to address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time triggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In the FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a suboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints for the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety margin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it falls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF constraints. The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC) for autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization noise and obstacle position uncertainties. Multiple AV-pedestrian interaction scenarios are considered, with 1,500 Monte Carlo runs conducted for all scenarios. In the most challenging setting with pedestrian detection uncertainty of 5 m, the proposed framework achieves a 94-96% success rate of not colliding with the pedestrians over 300 trials while maintaining the lowest mean cross-track error (CTE = 3.2-3.6 m) to the reference path. The reduced CTE indicates faster trajectory recovery after obstacle avoidance, demonstrating a balance between safety and performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging Perspectives: Foundation Model Guided BEV Maps for 3D Object Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10287v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving.

| **[Improving Hierarchical Representations of Vectorized HD Maps with Perspective Clues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11155v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The construction of vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps from onboard surround-view cameras has become a significant focus in autonomous driving. However, current map vector estimation pipelines face two key limitations: input-agnostic queries struggle to capture complex map structures, and the view transformation leads to information loss. These issues often result in inaccurate shape restoration or missing instances in map predictions. To address this concern, we propose a novel approach, namely \textbf{PerCMap}, which explicitly exploits clues from perspective-view features at both instance and point level. Specifically, at instance level, we propose Cross-view Instance Activation (CIA) to activate instance queries across surround-view images, thereby helping the model recover the instance attributes of map vectors. At point level, we design Dual-view Point Embedding (DPE), which fuses features from both views to generate input-aware positional embeddings and improve the accuracy of point coordinate estimation. Extensive experiments on \textit{nuScenes} and \textit{Argoverse 2} demonstrate that PerCMap achieves strong and consistent performance across benchmarks, reaching 67.1 and 70.5 mAP, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Style-Based Metric for Quantifying the Synthetic-to-Real Gap in Autonomous Driving Image Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10203v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Beyond ADE and FDE: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Safety-Critical Prediction in Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10086v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution. Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation, contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, there has been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset. All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a computer vision conference (under review)</p></details> | None |

Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

However, LiDAR's high cost continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).</p></details> |  | None |

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally, extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench, demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across all scales and scenarios.

Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control. Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries, outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection choice.

These degradations affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are further classified based on their scope: single-task models, multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time deployment, and agentic AI frameworks.

Although calibrated physics-based and trained data-driven CFMs can replicate human driving behavior, their reliance on specific datasets limits generalization across diverse scenarios and reduces reliability in real-world deployment. Moreover, these models typically focus on behavioral fidelity and do not support the explicit optimization of local and string stability, which are increasingly important for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge-Informed Deep Learning (KIDL) paradigm that distills the generalization capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into a lightweight and stability-aware neural architecture. LLMs are used to extract fundamental car-following knowledge beyond dataset-specific patterns, and this knowledge is transferred to a reliable, tractable, and computationally efficient model through knowledge distillation. KIDL also incorporates stability constraints directly into its training objective, ensuring that the resulting model not only emulates human-like behavior but also satisfies the local and string stability requirements essential for real-world AV deployment. We evaluate KIDL on the real-world NGSIM and HighD datasets, comparing its performance with representative physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid CFMs. Both empirical and theoretical results consistently demonstrate KIDL's superior behavioral generalization and traffic flow stability, offering a robust and scalable solution for next-generation traffic systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Safer and Understandable Driver Intention Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09200v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations.

However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.</p></details> | <details><summary>We be...</summary><p>We believe that the contribution of this paper is not enough, so we integrated it into another new paper.

While open-set detection methods aim to address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

| **[Robust Driving Control for Autonomous Vehicles: An Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09041v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii) they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation. Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Single Domain Generalization of LiDAR-based Semantic Segmentation under Imperfect Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09035v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability. The code will be released at https://github.com/xmm-prio/BEVTrack.</p></details> | IJCAI version | [Code Link](https://github.com/xmm-prio/BEVTrack) |

However, extrapolating from offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work, we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13% improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2025 (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> | None |
| **[ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Approximate Domain Unlearning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08132v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g., illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code: https://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning/.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning) |
| **[LinguaSim: Interactive Multi-Vehicle Testing Scenario Generation via Natural Language Instruction Based on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08046v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop, interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.</p></details> |  | None |
