| **[3D Gaussian Splatting against Moving Objects for High-Fidelity Street Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12001v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate reconstruction of dynamic street scenes is critical for applications in autonomous driving, augmented reality, and virtual reality. Traditional methods relying on dense point clouds and triangular meshes struggle with moving objects, occlusions, and real-time processing constraints, limiting their effectiveness in complex urban environments. While multi-view stereo and neural radiance fields have advanced 3D reconstruction, they face challenges in computational efficiency and handling scene dynamics. This paper proposes a novel 3D Gaussian point distribution method for dynamic street scene reconstruction. Our approach introduces an adaptive transparency mechanism that eliminates moving objects while preserving high-fidelity static scene details. Additionally, iterative refinement of Gaussian point distribution enhances geometric accuracy and texture representation. We integrate directional encoding with spatial position optimization to optimize storage and rendering efficiency, reducing redundancy while maintaining scene integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high reconstruction quality, improved rendering performance, and adaptability in large-scale dynamic environments. These contributions establish a robust framework for real-time, high-precision 3D reconstruction, advancing the practicality of dynamic scene modeling across multiple applications.</p></details> |  | None |

To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining as straightforward to integrate and as generic as auxiliary supervision. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in vectorized map prediction performance up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline and find similar improvements. A detailed analysis of the latent BEV grid confirms a more structured latent space of AugMapNet and shows the value of our novel concept beyond pure performance improvement. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision-Making: Scenarios, Approaches, Challenges and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13415v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent decision-making techniques have gradually surpassed human levels in various human-machine competitions, especially in complex multi-agent cooperative task scenarios. Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). Theseapproaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models(LLMs)reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL andLLMs-baseddecision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks. Further, several prominent research directions in the future and potential challenges of multi-agent cooperative decision-making are also detailed.</p></details> | 54 pages, 24 figures | None |
| **[Dual-Domain Homogeneous Fusion with Cross-Modal Mamba and Progressive Decoder for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08992v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fusing LiDAR and image features in a homogeneous BEV domain has become popular for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, this paradigm is constrained by the excessive feature compression. While some works explore dense voxel fusion to enable better feature interaction, they face high computational costs and challenges in query generation. Additionally, feature misalignment in both domains results in suboptimal detection accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a Dual-Domain Homogeneous Fusion network (DDHFusion), which leverages the complementarily of both BEV and voxel domains while mitigating their drawbacks. Specifically, we first transform image features into BEV and sparse voxel representations using lift-splat-shot and our proposed Semantic-Aware Feature Sampling (SAFS) module. The latter significantly reduces computational overhead by discarding unimportant voxels. Next, we introduce Homogeneous Voxel and BEV Fusion (HVF and HBF) networks for multi-modal fusion within respective domains. They are equipped with novel cross-modal Mamba blocks to resolve feature misalignment and enable comprehensive scene perception. The output voxel features are injected into the BEV space to compensate for the information loss brought by direct height compression. During query selection, the Progressive Query Generation (PQG) mechanism is implemented in the BEV domain to reduce false negatives caused by feature compression. Furthermore, we propose a Progressive Decoder (QD) that sequentially aggregates not only context-rich BEV features but also geometry-aware voxel features with deformable attention and the Multi-Modal Voxel Feature Mixing (MMVFM) block for precise classification and box regression.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[A Generalized Control Revision Method for Autonomous Driving Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14688v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is one of the most crucial challenges of autonomous driving vehicles, and one solution to guarantee safety is to employ an additional control revision module after the planning backbone. Control Barrier Function (CBF) has been widely used because of its strong mathematical foundation on safety. However, the incompatibility with heterogeneous perception data and incomplete consideration of traffic scene elements make existing systems hard to be applied in dynamic and complex real-world scenarios. In this study, we introduce a generalized control revision method for autonomous driving safety, which adopts both vectorized perception and occupancy grid map as inputs and comprehensively models multiple types of traffic scene constraints based on a new proposed barrier function. Traffic elements are integrated into one unified framework, decoupled from specific scenario settings or rules. Experiments on CARLA, SUMO, and OnSite simulator prove that the proposed algorithm could realize safe control revision under complicated scenes, adapting to various planning backbones, road topologies, and risk types. Physical platform validation also verifies the real-world application feasibility.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Clustering is back: Reaching state-of-the-art LiDAR instance segmentation without training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13203v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoptic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds is fundamental to outdoor scene understanding, with autonomous driving being a primary application. While state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on end-to-end deep learning architectures and extensive manual annotations of instances, the significant cost and time investment required for labeling large-scale point cloud datasets remains a major bottleneck in this field. In this work, we demonstrate that competitive panoptic segmentation can be achieved using only semantic labels, with instances predicted without any training or annotations. Our method achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks including SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and outperforms every publicly available method on SemanticKITTI as a drop-in instance head replacement, while running in real-time on a single-threaded CPU and requiring no instance labels. Our method is fully explainable, and requires no learning or parameter tuning.

| **[InsightDrive: Insight Scene Representation for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13047v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directly generating planning results from raw sensors has become increasingly prevalent due to its adaptability and robustness in complex scenarios. Scene representation, as a key module in the pipeline, has traditionally relied on conventional perception, which focus on the global scene. However, in driving scenarios, human drivers typically focus only on regions that directly impact driving, which often coincide with those required for end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving method called InsightDrive is proposed, which organizes perception by language-guided scene representation. We introduce an instance-centric scene tokenizer that transforms the surrounding environment into map- and object-aware instance tokens. Scene attention language descriptions, which highlight key regions and obstacles affecting the ego vehicle's movement, are generated by a vision-language model that leverages the cognitive reasoning capabilities of foundation models. We then align scene descriptions with visual features using the vision-language model, guiding visual attention through these descriptions to give effectively scene representation. Furthermore, we employ self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model the ego-agents and ego-map relationships to comprehensively build the topological relationships of the scene. Finally, based on scene understanding, we jointly perform motion prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that the proposed InsightDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end autonomous driving.

| **[SparseAlign: A Fully Sparse Framework for Cooperative Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12982v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative perception can increase the view field and decrease the occlusion of an ego vehicle, hence improving the perception performance and safety of autonomous driving. Despite the success of previous works on cooperative object detection, they mostly operate on dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature maps, which are computationally demanding and can hardly be extended to long-range detection problems. More efficient fully sparse frameworks are rarely explored. In this work, we design a fully sparse framework, SparseAlign, with three key features: an enhanced sparse 3D backbone, a query-based temporal context learning module, and a robust detection head specially tailored for sparse features. Extensive experimental results on both OPV2V and DairV2X datasets show that our framework, despite its sparsity, outperforms the state of the art with less communication bandwidth requirements. In addition, experiments on the OPV2Vt and DairV2Xt datasets for time-aligned cooperative object detection also show a significant performance gain compared to the baseline works.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OptiPMB: Enhancing 3D Multi-Object Tracking with Optimized Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12968v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enables robust perception, navigation, and planning in complex environments. While deep learning-based solutions have demonstrated impressive 3D MOT performance, model-based approaches remain appealing for their simplicity, interpretability, and data efficiency. Conventional model-based trackers typically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the tracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic data association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set (RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a theoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning. In this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs an optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several key innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a measurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track initialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively maintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track extraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior tracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing a new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for future research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Treble Counterfactual VLMs: A Causal Approach to Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06169v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multi-modal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and reasoning. However, they often generate hallucinated outputs inconsistent with the visual context or prompt, limiting reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging. Existing studies link hallucination to statistical biases, language priors, and biased feature learning but lack a structured causal understanding. In this work, we introduce a causal perspective to analyze and mitigate hallucination in VLMs. We hypothesize that hallucination arises from unintended direct influences of either the vision or text modality, bypassing proper multi-modal fusion. To address this, we construct a causal graph for VLMs and employ counterfactual analysis to estimate the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of vision, text, and their cross-modal interaction on the output. We systematically identify and mitigate these unintended direct effects to ensure that responses are primarily driven by genuine multi-modal fusion. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) designing structural causal graphs to distinguish correct fusion pathways from spurious modality shortcuts, (2) estimating modality-specific and cross-modal NDE using perturbed image representations, hallucinated text embeddings, and degraded visual inputs, and (3) implementing a test-time intervention module to dynamically adjust the model's dependence on each modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination while preserving task performance, providing a robust and interpretable framework for improving VLM reliability. To enhance accessibility and reproducibility, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/TREE985/Treble-Counterfactual-VLMs.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TREE985/Treble-Counterfactual-VLMs) |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Secure On-Device Video OOD Detection Without Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06166v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. While deploying personalized OOD detection directly on edge devices is desirable, it remains challenging due to large model sizes and the computational infeasibility of on-device training. Federated learning partially addresses this but still requires gradient computation and backpropagation, exceeding the capabilities of many edge devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose SecDOOD, a secure cloud-device collaboration framework for efficient on-device OOD detection without requiring device-side backpropagation. SecDOOD utilizes cloud resources for model training while ensuring user data privacy by retaining sensitive information on-device. Central to SecDOOD is a HyperNetwork-based personalized parameter generation module, which adapts cloud-trained models to device-specific distributions by dynamically generating local weight adjustments, effectively combining central and local information without local fine-tuning. Additionally, our dynamic feature sampling and encryption strategy selectively encrypts only the most informative feature channels, largely reducing encryption overhead without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and OOD scenarios demonstrate that SecDOOD achieves performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, enabling secure, efficient, and personalized OOD detection on resource-limited edge devices. To enhance accessibility and reproducibility, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dystopians/SecDOOD.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Dystopians/SecDOOD) |

Using a lightweight ResNet-34 network without complex components, the framework incorporates expanded evaluation metrics, including traffic light compliance (TL), lane-keeping ability (LK), and extended comfort (EC) to address unsafe behaviors not captured by traditional NAVSIM-derived teachers. Like other end-to-end autonomous driving approaches, \hydra processes raw images directly without relying on privileged perception signals. Hydra-MDP++ achieves state-of-the-art performance by integrating these components with a 91.0% drive score on NAVSIM through scaling to a V2-99 image encoder, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling diverse driving scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Image and video segmentation are fundamental tasks in computer vision with wide-ranging applications in healthcare, agriculture, industrial inspection, and autonomous driving. With the advent of large-scale foundation models, SAM2 - an improved version of SAM (Segment Anything Model)has been optimized for segmentation tasks, demonstrating enhanced performance in complex scenarios. However, SAM2's adaptability and limitations in specific domains require further investigation. This paper systematically analyzes the application of SAM2 in image and video segmentation and evaluates its performance in various fields. We begin by introducing the foundational concepts of image segmentation, categorizing foundation models, and exploring the technical characteristics of SAM and SAM2. Subsequently, we delve into SAM2's applications in static image and video segmentation, emphasizing its performance in specialized areas such as medical imaging and the challenges of cross-domain adaptability. As part of our research, we reviewed over 200 related papers to provide a comprehensive analysis of the topic. Finally, the paper highlights the strengths and weaknesses of SAM2 in segmentation tasks, identifies the technical challenges it faces, and proposes future development directions. This review provides valuable insights and practical recommendations for optimizing and applying SAM2 in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> | None |

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods. For widespread use and further development, the research work is fully open-source at https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Metho...</summary><p>Method mistakes appearing in this paper</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO) |

Neural rendering techniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic environments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based approaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera and LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling. Conversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for scene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization. However, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model non-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to sensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified representation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for rendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data rendering. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This work presents a unified and efficient solution for realistic simulation of camera and LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, offering significant advancements in both rendering quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Unfortunately, acquiring high-quality stereo images remains challenging due to the precise calibration requirements of dual-camera setups and the complexity of obtaining accurate, dense disparity maps. Existing stereo image generation methods typically focus on either visual quality for viewing or geometric accuracy for matching, but not both. We introduce GenStereo, a diffusion-based approach, to bridge this gap. The method includes two primary innovations (1) conditioning the diffusion process on a disparity-aware coordinate embedding and a warped input image, allowing for more precise stereo alignment than previous methods, and (2) an adaptive fusion mechanism that intelligently combines the diffusion-generated image with a warped image, improving both realism and disparity consistency. Through extensive training on 11 diverse stereo datasets, GenStereo demonstrates strong generalization ability. GenStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stereo image generation and unsupervised stereo matching tasks. Our framework eliminates the need for complex hardware setups while enabling high-quality stereo image generation, making it valuable for both real-world applications and unsupervised learning scenarios.

However, their limitations in fine-grained spatial reasoning pose challenges for system interpretability and user trust. We introduce Logic-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that improves LMMs' spatial understanding in driving scenarios. Logic-RAG constructs a dynamic knowledge base (KB) about object-object relationships in first-order logic (FOL) using a perception module, a query-to-logic embedder, and a logical inference engine. We evaluated Logic-RAG on visual-spatial queries using both synthetic and real-world driving videos. When using popular LMMs (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5) as proxies for an autonomous driving system, these models achieved only 55% accuracy on synthetic driving scenes and under 75% on real-world driving scenes. Augmenting them with Logic-RAG increased their accuracies to over 80% and 90%, respectively. An ablation study showed that even without logical inference, the fact-based context constructed by Logic-RAG alone improved accuracy by 15%. Logic-RAG is extensible: it allows seamless replacement of individual components with improved versions and enables domain experts to compose new knowledge in both FOL and natural language. In sum, Logic-RAG addresses critical spatial reasoning deficiencies in LMMs for autonomous driving applications.

Existing MCoT studies design various methodologies and innovative reasoning paradigms to address the unique challenges of image, video, speech, audio, 3D, and structured data across different modalities, achieving extensive success in applications such as robotics, healthcare, autonomous driving, and multimodal generation. However, MCoT still presents distinct challenges and opportunities that require further focus to ensure consistent thriving in this field, where, unfortunately, an up-to-date review of this domain is lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic survey of MCoT reasoning, elucidating the relevant foundational concepts and definitions.

| **[Point Cloud Based Scene Segmentation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12595v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving is a safety-critical application, and it is therefore a top priority that the accompanying assistance systems are able to provide precise information about the surrounding environment of the vehicle. Tasks such as 3D Object Detection deliver an insufficiently detailed understanding of the surrounding scene because they only predict a bounding box for foreground objects. In contrast, 3D Semantic Segmentation provides richer and denser information about the environment by assigning a label to each individual point, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving tasks, such as navigation or lane changes. To inspire future research, in this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art methods in the field of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for autonomous driving. We categorize the approaches into projection-based, 3D-based and hybrid methods. Moreover, we discuss the most important and commonly used datasets for this task and also emphasize the importance of synthetic data to support research when real-world data is limited. We further present the results of the different methods and compare them with respect to their segmentation accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CurveFormer++: 3D Lane Detection by Curve Propagation with Temporal Curve Queries and Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06423v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurate 3D lane detection using monocular cameras is important for downstream tasks. Recent CNN and Transformer approaches usually apply a two-stage model design. The first stage transforms the image feature from a front image into a bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Subsequently, a sub-network processes the BEV feature to generate the 3D detection results. However, these approaches heavily rely on a challenging image feature transformation module from a perspective view to a BEV representation. In our work, we present CurveFormer++, a single-stage Transformer-based method that does not require the view transform module and directly infers 3D lane results from the perspective image features. Specifically, our approach models the 3D lane detection task as a curve propagation problem, where each lane is represented by a curve query with a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. By employing a Transformer decoder, the model can iteratively refine the 3D lane results. A curve cross-attention module is introduced to calculate similarities between image features and curve queries. To handle varying lane lengths, we employ context sampling and anchor point restriction techniques to compute more relevant image features. Furthermore, we apply a temporal fusion module that incorporates selected informative sparse curve queries and their corresponding anchor point sets to leverage historical information. In the experiments, we evaluate our approach on two publicly real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our method provides outstanding performance compared with both CNN and Transformer based methods. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of each component.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.07989</p></details> | None |
| **[Car-1000: A New Large Scale Fine-Grained Visual Categorization Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12385v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) is a challenging but significant task in computer vision, which aims to recognize different sub-categories of birds, cars, airplanes, etc. Among them, recognizing models of different cars has significant application value in autonomous driving, traffic surveillance and scene understanding, which has received considerable attention in the past few years. However, Stanford-Car, the most widely used fine-grained dataset for car recognition, only has 196 different categories and only includes vehicle models produced earlier than 2013. Due to the rapid advancements in the automotive industry during recent years, the appearances of various car models have become increasingly intricate and sophisticated. Consequently, the previous Stanford-Car dataset fails to capture this evolving landscape and cannot satisfy the requirements of automotive industry. To address these challenges, in our paper, we introduce Car-1000, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for fine-grained visual categorization of diverse car models. Car-1000 encompasses vehicles from 165 different automakers, spanning a wide range of 1000 distinct car models.

To improve accuracy, prior research has implemented various computationally demanding and memory-intensive 3D operations, imposing significant computational requirements on the platform during training and testing. This paper proposes L2COcc, a lightweight camera-centric SSC framework that also accommodates LiDAR inputs. With our proposed efficient voxel transformer (EVT) and cross-modal knowledge modules, including feature similarity distillation (FSD), TPV distillation (TPVD) and prediction alignment distillation (PAD), our method substantially reduce computational burden while maintaining high accuracy. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the current state-of-the-art vision-based SSC methods regarding accuracy on both the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, our method is more lightweight, exhibiting a reduction in both memory consumption and inference time by over 23% compared to the current state-of-the-arts method.

While state-of-the-art (SOTA) LPR methods perform well in clean weather, they still struggle with weather-induced corruption commonly encountered in driving scenarios. To tackle this, we propose ResLPRNet, a novel LiDAR data restoration network that largely enhances LPR performance under adverse weather by restoring corrupted LiDAR scans using a wavelet transform-based network. ResLPRNet is efficient, lightweight and can be integrated plug-and-play with pretrained LPR models without substantial additional computational cost. Given the lack of LPR datasets under adverse weather, we introduce ResLPR, a novel benchmark that examines SOTA LPR methods under a wide range of LiDAR distortions induced by severe snow, fog, and rain conditions. Experiments on our proposed WeatherKITTI and WeatherNCLT datasets demonstrate the resilience and notable gains achieved by using our restoration method with multiple LPR approaches in challenging weather scenarios.

This paper investigates E2E robot navigation in unstructured road environments. First, we introduce two data collection pipelines - one for real-world robot data and another for synthetic data generated using the Isaac Sim simulator, which together produce an unstructured robotics navigation dataset -- FreeWorld Dataset. Second, we fine-tuned an efficient E2E autonomous driving model -- VAD -- using our datasets to validate the performance and adaptability of E2E autonomous driving models in these environments. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning through our datasets significantly enhances the navigation potential of E2E autonomous driving models in unstructured robotic environments. Thus, this paper presents the first dataset targeting E2E robot navigation tasks in unstructured scenarios, and provides a benchmark based on vision-based E2E autonomous driving algorithms to facilitate the development of E2E navigation technology for logistics and service robots.

However, existing E2E-AD systems typically adopt a traditional multi-task framework, addressing perception, prediction, and planning tasks through separate task-specific heads. Despite being trained in a fully differentiable manner, they still encounter issues with task coordination, and the system complexity remains high. In this work, we introduce DiffAD, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that redefines autonomous driving as a conditional image generation task. By rasterizing heterogeneous targets onto a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) and modeling their latent distribution, DiffAD unifies various driving objectives and jointly optimizes all driving tasks in a single framework, significantly reducing system complexity and harmonizing task coordination. The reverse process iteratively refines the generated BEV image, resulting in more robust and realistic driving behaviors. Closed-loop evaluations in Carla demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, achieving a new state-of-the-art Success Rate and Driving Score. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

While traditional sparse convolution techniques efficiently capture local structures, they struggle with modeling long-range relationships. However, capturing long-range dependencies is fundamental for 3D object detection. In contrast, transformers are designed to capture these long-range dependencies through attention mechanisms. But, they come with high computational costs, due to their quadratic query-key-value interactions. Furthermore, directly applying attention to non-empty voxels is inefficient due to the sparse nature of 3D scenes. Our SFMNet is built on a novel Sparse Focal Modulation (SFM) module, which integrates short- and long-range contexts with linear complexity by leveraging a new hierarchical sparse convolution design. This approach enables SFMNet to achieve high detection performance with improved efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale LiDAR scenes. We show that our detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on autonomous driving datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the current open-source datasets do not systematically include long-tail distributed scenario data, making acquiring such scenarios a formidable task. To address this problem, a data mining framework is proposed, which performs in-depth analysis on two widely-used datasets, NGSIM and INTERACTION, to pinpoint data with hazardous behavioral traits, aiming to bridge the gap in these overlooked scenarios. The approach utilizes Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) based on an enhanced Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model, integrated with the vehicle's environmental analysis, to iteratively refine and represent the newly generated vehicle trajectory. Innovatively, the solution optimizes the generation of adversarial scenario data from the perspectives of sensitivity and reasonable adversarial. It is demonstrated through experiments that, compared to the unfiltered data and baseline models, the approach exhibits more adversarial yet natural behavior regarding collision rate, acceleration, and lane changes, thereby validating its suitability for generating scenario data and providing constructive insights for the development of future scenarios and subsequent decision training.</p></details> |  | None |

However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

Current approaches are trained to predict trajectories in an open-loop environment, which struggle with quick reactions to other agents in closed-loop environments and risk generating kinematically infeasible plans due to the gap between open-loop training and closed-loop driving. In this paper, we introduce Hydra-NeXt, a novel multi-branch planning framework that unifies trajectory prediction, control prediction, and a trajectory refinement network in one model. Unlike current open-loop trajectory prediction models that only handle general-case planning, Hydra-NeXt further utilizes a control decoder to focus on short-term actions, which enables faster responses to dynamic situations and reactive agents. Moreover, we propose the Trajectory Refinement module to augment and refine the planning decisions by effectively adhering to kinematic constraints in closed-loop environments. This unified approach bridges the gap between open-loop training and closed-loop driving, demonstrating superior performance of 65.89 Driving Score (DS) and 48.20% Success Rate (SR) on the Bench2Drive dataset without relying on external experts for data collection. Hydra-NeXt surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 22.98 DS and 17.49 SR, marking a significant advancement in autonomous driving.

However, it requires laborious human efforts to annotate the point cloud for training a segmentation model. To address this challenge, we propose a YoCo framework, which generates 3D pseudo labels using minimal coarse click annotations in the bird's eye view plane. It is a significant challenge to produce high-quality pseudo labels from sparse annotations. Our YoCo framework first leverages vision foundation models combined with geometric constraints from point clouds to enhance pseudo label generation. Second, a temporal and spatial-based label updating module is designed to generate reliable updated labels. It leverages predictions from adjacent frames and utilizes the inherent density variation of point clouds (dense near, sparse far). Finally, to further improve label quality, an IoU-guided enhancement module is proposed, replacing pseudo labels with high-confidence and high-IoU predictions. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate YoCo's effectiveness and generality, achieving state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised methods and surpassing fully supervised Cylinder3D. Additionally, the YoCo is suitable for various networks, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised methods with minimal fine-tuning using only 0.8% of the fully labeled data, significantly reducing annotation costs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 | None |

However, current methods are mostly constrained by processing only single-frame inputs, which hampers their robustness and effectiveness in complex scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose an online map construction system that exploits the long-term temporal information to build a consistent vectorized map. First, the system efficiently fuses all historical road marking detections from an off-the-shelf network into a semantic voxel map, which is implemented using a hashing-based strategy to exploit the sparsity of road elements. Then reliable voxels are found by examining the fused information and incrementally clustered into an instance-level representation of road markings. Finally, the system incorporates domain knowledge to estimate the geometric and topological structures of roads, which can be directly consumed by the planning and control (PnC) module. Through experiments conducted in complicated urban environments, we have demonstrated that the output of our system is more consistent and accurate than the network output by a large margin and can be effectively used in a closed-loop autonomous driving system.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures | None |

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and overcoming occlusions, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous driving. In recent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged; however, these datasets primarily focus on cameras and LiDAR, neglecting 4D Radar, a sensor used in single-vehicle autonomous driving to provide robust perception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap created by the absence of 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we present V2X-Radar, the first large-scale, real-world multi-modal dataset featuring 4D Radar. V2X-Radar dataset is collected using a connected vehicle platform and an intelligent roadside unit equipped with 4D Radar, LiDAR, and multi-view cameras. The collected data encompasses sunny and rainy weather conditions, spanning daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as various typical challenging scenarios. The dataset consists of 20K LiDAR frames, 40K camera images, and 20K 4D Radar data, including 350K annotated boxes across five categories. To support various research domains, we have established V2X-Radar-C for cooperative perception, V2X-Radar-I for roadside perception, and V2X-Radar-V for single-vehicle perception. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive benchmarks across these three sub-datasets. We will release all datasets and benchmark codebase at http://openmpd.com/column/V2X-Radar and https://github.com/yanglei18/V2X-Radar.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/yanglei18/V2X-Radar) |

Conventional approaches, such as real-world test drives, are not only expensive but also lack the flexibility to capture targeted edge cases for thorough evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a controllable latent diffusion that guides the training of diffusion models via reinforcement learning to automatically generate a diverse and controllable set of driving scenarios for virtual testing. Our approach removes the reliance on large-scale real-world data by generating complex scenarios whose properties can be finely tuned to challenge and assess autonomous vehicle systems. Experimental results show that our approach has the lowest collision rate of $0.098$ and lowest off-road rate of $0.096$, demonstrating superiority over existing baselines.

One common solution is to have a ``fallback layer'' that checks the planned trajectory for rule violations and replaces it with a pre-defined safe action if necessary. Another approach involves adjusting the planner's decisions to minimize a pre-defined ``cost function'' using additional system predictions such as road layouts and detected obstacles. However, these pre-programmed rules or cost functions cannot learn and improve with new training data, often resulting in overly conservative behaviors. In this work, we propose Centaur (Cluster Entropy for Test-time trAining using Uncertainty) which updates a planner's behavior via test-time training, without relying on hand-engineered rules or cost functions. Instead, we measure and minimize the uncertainty in the planner's decisions. For this, we develop a novel uncertainty measure, called Cluster Entropy, which is simple, interpretable, and compatible with state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Using data collected at prior test-time time-steps, we perform an update to the model's parameters using a gradient that minimizes the Cluster Entropy. With only this sole gradient update prior to inference, Centaur exhibits significant improvements, ranking first on the navtest leaderboard with notable gains in safety-critical metrics such as time to collision. To provide detailed insights on a per-scenario basis, we also introduce navsafe, a challenging new benchmark, which highlights previously undiscovered failure modes of driving models.</p></details> |  | None |

Their integration into autonomous driving systems shows promising results in isolated proof-of-concept applications, while their performance is evaluated on selective singular aspects of perception, reasoning, or planning. To leverage their full potential a systematic framework for evaluating MLLMs in the context of autonomous driving is required. This paper proposes a holistic framework for a capability-driven evaluation of MLLMs in autonomous driving. The framework structures scenario understanding along the four core capability dimensions semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical. They are derived from the general requirements of autonomous driving systems, human driver cognition, and language-based reasoning. It further organises the domain into context layers, processing modalities, and downstream tasks such as language-based interaction and decision-making. To illustrate the framework's applicability, two exemplary traffic scenarios are analysed, grounding the proposed dimensions in realistic driving situations. The framework provides a foundation for the structured evaluation of MLLMs' potential for scenario understanding in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE IAVVC 2025, Under Review</p></details> | None |

Classic localization methods typically follow the retrieve-then-register paradigm, achieving remarkable success. Recently, the emergence of end-to-end localization approaches has offered distinct advantages, including a streamlined system architecture and the elimination of the need to store extensive map data. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results, current end-to-end localization approaches still face limitations in robustness and accuracy. Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) image is one of the most widely adopted data representations in autonomous driving. It significantly reduces data complexity while preserving spatial structure and scale consistency, making it an ideal representation for localization tasks. However, research on BEV-based end-to-end localization remains notably insufficient. To fill this gap, we propose BEVDiffLoc, a novel framework that formulates LiDAR localization as a conditional generation of poses. Leveraging the properties of BEV, we first introduce a specific data augmentation method to significantly enhance the diversity of input data. Then, the Maximum Feature Aggregation Module and Vision Transformer are employed to learn robust features while maintaining robustness against significant rotational view variations. Finally, we incorporate a diffusion model that iteratively refines the learned features to recover the absolute pose. Extensive experiments on the Oxford Radar RobotCar and NCLT datasets demonstrate that BEVDiffLoc outperforms the baseline methods.

Although this approach aids in concentrating on salient features and diminishing computational burden, it incurs the loss of vital detailed information, a drawback that is particularly damaging in end-to-end autonomous driving scenarios. Downsampling can lead to an inadequate capture of distant or small objects such as pedestrians, road signs, or obstacles, all of which are crucial for safe navigation. This loss of features negatively impacts an autonomous driving system's capacity to accurately perceive the environment, potentially escalating the risk of accidents. To tackle this problem, we put forward the Dynamic Resolution Vision Language Model (DynRsl-VLM). DynRsl-VLM incorporates a dynamic resolution image input processing approach that captures all entity feature information within an image while ensuring that the image input remains computationally tractable for the Vision Transformer (ViT). Moreover, we devise a novel image-text alignment module to replace the Q-Former, enabling simple and efficient alignment with text when dealing with dynamic resolution image inputs.

This paper introduces a Gaussian Splatting (GS) based system to address these challenges: We first break down sensor simulator components and analyze the possible advantages of GS over NeRF. Then in practice, we refactor three crucial components through GS, to leverage its explicit scene representation and real-time rendering: (1) choosing the 2D neural Gaussian representation for physics-compliant scene and sensor modeling, (2) proposing a scene editing pipeline to leverage Gaussian primitives library for data augmentation, and (3) coupling a controllable diffusion model for scene expansion and harmonization. We implement this framework on a proprietary autonomous driving dataset supporting cameras and LiDAR sensors. We demonstrate through ablation studies that our approach reduces frame-wise simulation latency, achieves better geometric and photometric consistency, and enables interpretable explicit scene editing and expansion. Furthermore, we showcase how integrating such a GS-based sensor simulator with traffic and dynamic simulators enables full-stack testing of end-to-end autonomy algorithms. Our work provides both algorithmic insights and practical validation, establishing GS as a cornerstone for industrial-grade sensor simulation.</p></details> |  | None |

Implicitly infusing the spatial geometric prior knowledge acquired by a data-fusion teacher network into a single-modal student network is a practical, albeit less explored research avenue. This article delves into this topic and resorts to knowledge distillation approaches to address this problem. We introduce the Learning to Infuse ''X'' (LIX) framework, with novel contributions in both logit distillation and feature distillation aspects. We present a mathematical proof that underscores the limitation of using a single, fixed weight in decoupled knowledge distillation and introduce a logit-wise dynamic weight controller as a solution to this issue. Furthermore, we develop an adaptively-recalibrated feature distillation algorithm, including two novel techniques: feature recalibration via kernel regression and in-depth feature consistency quantification via centered kernel alignment. Extensive experiments conducted with intermediate-fusion and late-fusion networks across various public datasets provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating the superior performance of our LIX framework when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, high data collection costs and diverse real-world scenarios limit the scale of training data. Once distribution shifts occur between training and test data, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation, known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problems. To address this, controllable Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion offers a potential solution for training data enhancement, which is required to generate diverse OOD scenarios with precise 3D object geometry. Nevertheless, existing controllable T2I approaches are restricted by the limited scale of training data or struggle to preserve all annotated 3D objects. In this paper, we present DriveGEN, a method designed to improve the robustness of 3D detectors in Driving via Training-Free Controllable Text-to-Image Diffusion Generation. Without extra diffusion model training, DriveGEN consistently preserves objects with precise 3D geometry across diverse OOD generations, consisting of 2 stages: 1) Self-Prototype Extraction: We empirically find that self-attention features are semantic-aware but require accurate region selection for 3D objects. Thus, we extract precise object features via layouts to capture 3D object geometry, termed self-prototypes. 2) Prototype-Guided Diffusion: To preserve objects across various OOD scenarios, we perform semantic-aware feature alignment and shallow feature alignment during denoising.

However, training these models requires large amounts of labeled data, which is time-consuming and expensive. Considering that the real-world driving data exhibits a long-tailed distribution where simple scenarios constitute a majority part of the data, we are thus inspired to identify the most challenging scenarios within it. Subsequently, we can efficiently improve the performance of the model by training with the selected data of the highest value. Prior research has focused on the selection of valuable data by empirically designed strategies. However, manually designed methods suffer from being less generalizable to new data distributions. Observing that the BEV (Bird's Eye View) features in end-to-end models contain all the information required to represent the scenario, we propose an active learning framework that relies on these vectorized scene-level features, called SEAD. The framework selects initial data based on driving-environmental information and incremental data based on BEV features. Experiments show that we only need 30\% of the nuScenes training data to achieve performance close to what can be achieved with the full dataset.

Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of Trajectory Mamba in trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing defence methods are predominantly white-box approaches that require access to model parameters and extensive modifications, making them costly and impractical for many real-world scenarios. Although some black-box defences have been proposed, they often impose input constraints or require multiple queries, limiting their effectiveness in safety-critical tasks such as autonomous driving. To address these challenges, we propose a novel black-box defence framework called \textbf{T}extual \textbf{A}nchoring for \textbf{I}mmunizing \textbf{J}ailbreak \textbf{I}mages (\textbf{TAIJI}). TAIJI leverages key phrase-based textual anchoring to enhance the model's ability to assess and mitigate the harmful content embedded within both visual and textual prompts. Unlike existing methods, TAIJI operates effectively with a single query during inference, while preserving the VLM's performance on benign tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAIJI significantly enhances the safety and reliability of VLMs, providing a practical and efficient solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review of IJCAI-25</p></details> | None |

One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model.

Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training. Current methods often overlook uncertainties arising from adversarial conditions or distributional shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation under various camera corruption scenarios, such as fog or missing cameras, demonstrates that our approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty by assigning higher uncertainty values to unseen data. We introduce region-specific corruptions to simulate defects affecting only a single camera and validate our findings through both scene-level and region-level assessments. Our results show superior performance in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection and confidence calibration compared to common baselines such as Deep Ensembles and MC-Dropout.

Nevertheless, critical limitations persist: reconstruction-based methods exhibit substantial performance deterioration under significant viewpoint deviations from training trajectories, while generation-based techniques struggle with temporal coherence and precise scene controllability. To overcome these challenges, we present MuDG, an innovative framework that integrates Multi-modal Diffusion model with Gaussian Splatting (GS) for Urban Scene Reconstruction. MuDG leverages aggregated LiDAR point clouds with RGB and geometric priors to condition a multi-modal video diffusion model, synthesizing photorealistic RGB, depth, and semantic outputs for novel viewpoints. This synthesis pipeline enables feed-forward NVS without computationally intensive per-scene optimization, providing comprehensive supervision signals to refine 3DGS representations for rendering robustness enhancement under extreme viewpoint changes.

TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints.

Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel $\textbf{T}$raffic-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{R}$adar $\textbf{S}$cene flow estimation method, named $\textbf{TARS}$, which utilizes the motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. Therefrom, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space, enabling a holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

The CARLA simulator is often the preferred choice, and the autonomous agents from the CARLA Leaderboard challenge are regarded as the best-performing agents within this environment. However, researchers who test these agents, rather than training their own ones from scratch, often face challenges in utilizing them within customized test environments and scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce PCLA (Pretrained CARLA Leaderboard Agents), an open-source Python testing framework that includes nine high-performing pre-trained autonomous agents from the Leaderboard challenges. PCLA is the first infrastructure specifically designed for testing various autonomous agents in arbitrary CARLA environments/scenarios. PCLA provides a simple way to deploy Leaderboard agents onto a vehicle without relying on the Leaderboard codebase, it allows researchers to easily switch between agents without requiring modifications to CARLA versions or programming environments, and it is fully compatible with the latest version of CARLA while remaining independent of the Leaderboard's specific CARLA version.

However, achieving high-granularity surface reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering remains a challenge. Gaussian splatting offers efficient photorealistic rendering but struggles with geometric inconsistencies due to fragmented primitives and sparse observational data in robotics applications. Existing regularization methods, which rely on render-derived constraints, often fail in complex environments. Moreover, effectively integrating sparse LiDAR data with Gaussian splatting remains challenging. We propose a unified LiDAR-visual system that synergizes Gaussian splatting with a neural signed distance field. The accurate LiDAR point clouds enable a trained neural signed distance field to offer a manifold geometry field, This motivates us to offer an SDF-based Gaussian initialization for physically grounded primitive placement and a comprehensive geometric regularization for geometrically consistent rendering and reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality across diverse trajectories.

However, current methods fall short in achieving this level of generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UGP, a pruned framework designed to enhance generalization power for LiDAR point cloud registration. The core insight in UGP is the elimination of cross-attention mechanisms to improve generalization, allowing the network to concentrate on intra-frame feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a progressive self-attention module to reduce ambiguity in large-scale scenes and integrate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features to incorporate semantic information about scene elements. Together, these enhancements significantly boost the network's generalization performance. We validated our approach through various generalization experiments in multiple outdoor scenes. In cross-distance generalization experiments on KITTI and nuScenes, UGP achieved state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall rates of 94.5% and 91.4%, respectively. In cross-dataset generalization from nuScenes to KITTI, UGP achieved a state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall of 90.9%.

However, the algorithmic backbone of neural networks is brittle to imperceptible perturbations in the system inputs, which were generally known as misclassifying attacks. By targeting the real-time processing capability, a new class of latency attacks are reported recently. They exploit new attack surfaces in object detectors by creating a computational bottleneck in the post-processing module, that leads to cascading failure and puts the real-time downstream tasks at risks. In this work, we take an initial attempt to defend against this attack via background-attentive adversarial training that is also cognizant of the underlying hardware capabilities. We first draw system-level connections between latency attack and hardware capacity across heterogeneous GPU devices. Based on the particular adversarial behaviors, we utilize objectness loss as a proxy and build background attention into the adversarial training pipeline, and achieve a reasonable balance between clean and robust accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the defense effectiveness of restoring real-time processing capability from $13$ FPS to $43$ FPS on Jetson Orin NX, with a better trade-off between the clean and robust accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mamba-VA: A Mamba-based Approach for Continuous Emotion Recognition in Valence-Arousal Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10104v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Emotion Recognition (CER) plays a crucial role in intelligent human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and autonomous driving. Emotion modeling based on the Valence-Arousal (VA) space enables a more nuanced representation of emotional states. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling long-term dependencies and capturing complex temporal dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel emotion recognition model, Mamba-VA, which leverages the Mamba architecture to efficiently model sequential emotional variations in video frames. First, the model employs a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to extract deep visual features from video frames, enhancing the robustness of temporal information. Then, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is utilized for temporal modeling to capture local temporal dependencies. Subsequently, Mamba is applied for long-sequence modeling, enabling the learning of global emotional trends. Finally, a fully connected (FC) layer performs regression analysis to predict continuous valence and arousal values. Experimental results on the Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation task of the 8th competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves valence and arousal scores of 0.5362 (0.5036) and 0.4310 (0.4119) on the validation (test) set, respectively, outperforming the baseline.

However, the over-reliance on real labeled data in LiDAR perception limits the scale of on-road attempts. 3D real world data is notoriously time-and-energy-consuming to annotate and lacks corner cases like rare traffic participants. On the contrary, in simulators like CARLA, generating labeled LiDAR point clouds with corner cases is a piece of cake. However, introducing synthetic point clouds to improve real perception is non-trivial. This stems from two challenges: 1) sample efficiency of simulation datasets 2) simulation-to-real gaps. To overcome both challenges, we propose a plug-and-play method called JiSAM , shorthand for Jittering augmentation, domain-aware backbone and memory-based Sectorized AlignMent. In extensive experiments conducted on the famous AD dataset NuScenes, we demonstrate that, with SOTA 3D object detector, JiSAM is able to utilize the simulation data and only labels on 2.5% available real data to achieve comparable performance to models trained on all real data. Additionally, JiSAM achieves more than 15 mAPs on the objects not labeled in the real training set. We will release models and codes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods are susceptible to the inaccurate calibration relationship between LiDAR and the camera sensor. Such inaccuracies result in errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, ultimately causing misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a robust fusion framework called Graph BEV. Addressing errors caused by inaccurate point cloud projection, we introduce a Local Align module that employs neighbor-aware depth features via Graph matching. Additionally, we propose a Global Align module to rectify the misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. Our Graph BEV framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP of 70.1\%, surpassing BEV Fusion by 1.6\% on the nuscenes validation set.

By performing occupancy prediction of the 3D space in the environment, the ability and robustness of scene understanding can be effectively improved. However, existing occupancy prediction tasks are primarily modeled using voxel or point cloud-based approaches: voxel-based network structures often suffer from the loss of spatial information due to the voxelization process, while point cloud-based methods, although better at retaining spatial location information, face limitations in representing volumetric structural details. To address this issue, we propose a dual-modal prediction method based on 3D Gaussian sets and sparse points, which balances both spatial location and volumetric structural information, achieving higher accuracy in semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, our method adopts a Transformer-based architecture, taking 3D Gaussian sets, sparse points, and queries as inputs. Through the multi-layer structure of the Transformer, the enhanced queries and 3D Gaussian sets jointly contribute to the semantic occupancy prediction, and an adaptive fusion mechanism integrates the semantic outputs of both modalities to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, to further improve accuracy, we dynamically refine the point cloud at each layer, allowing for more precise location information during occupancy prediction. We conducted experiments on the Occ3DnuScenes dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method on IoU based metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated with procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks do not capture real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive simulator. We analyze the characteristics of nuPlan's recorded logs and find that each city has its own unique driving behaviors, suggesting that robust planners must adapt to different environments. We learn to model such unique behaviors with BehaviorNet, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that predicts reactive agent behaviors using features derived from recently-observed agent histories; intuitively, some aggressive agents may tailgate lead vehicles, while others may not. To model such phenomena, BehaviorNet predicts the parameters of an agent's motion controller rather than directly predicting its spacetime trajectory (as most forecasters do). Finally, we present AdaptiveDriver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls different world models conditioned on BehaviorNet's predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveDriver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan closed-loop planning benchmark, improving over prior work by 2% on Test-14 Hard R-CLS, and generalizes even when evaluated on never-before-seen cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project has been accepted to the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025.

Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> |  | None |

To support this growth, cloud providers offer ML services to ease the integration of ML components in software systems. The evolving business requirements and the popularity of ML services have led practitioners of all skill levels to implement, and maintain ML service-based systems. However, they may not always adhere to optimal design and usage practices for ML cloud services, resulting in common misuse which could significantly degrade the quality of ML service-based systems and adversely affect their maintenance and evolution. Though much research has been conducted on ML service misuse, a consistent terminology and specification for these misuses remain absent. We therefore conduct in this paper a comprehensive, multi-vocal empirical study exploring the prevalence of ML cloud service misuses in practice. We propose a catalog of 20 ML cloud service misuses, most of which have not been studied in prior research. To achieve this, we conducted a) a systematic literature review of studies on ML misuses, b) a gray literature review of the official documentation provided by major cloud providers, c) an empirical analysis of a curated set of 377 ML service-based systems on GitHub, and d) a survey with 50 ML practitioners. Our results show that ML service misuses are common in both open-source projects and industry, often stemming from a lack of understanding of service capabilities, and insufficient documentation. This emphasizes the importance of ongoing education in best practices for ML services, which is the focus of this paper, while also highlighting the need for tools to automatically detect and refactor ML misuses.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often focus on either driving or vision-language understanding but achieving both high driving performance and extensive language understanding remains challenging. In addition, the dominant approach to tackle vision-language understanding is using visual question answering. However, for autonomous driving, this is only useful if it is aligned with the action space. Otherwise, the model's answers could be inconsistent with its behavior. Therefore, we propose a model that can handle three different tasks: (1) closed-loop driving, (2) vision-language understanding, and (3) language-action alignment.

However, existing DWMs are limited to scene generation and fail to incorporate scene understanding, which involves interpreting and reasoning about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a unified Driving World Model named HERMES. We seamlessly integrate 3D scene understanding and future scene evolution (generation) through a unified framework in driving scenarios. Specifically, HERMES leverages a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation to consolidate multi-view spatial information while preserving geometric relationships and interactions. We also introduce world queries, which incorporate world knowledge into BEV features via causal attention in the Large Language Model, enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive studies on nuScenes and OmniDrive-nuScenes datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing generation error by 32.4% and improving understanding metrics such as CIDEr by 8.0%.

However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RS2V-L: Vehicle-Mounted LiDAR Data Generation from Roadside Sensor Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07085v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving solutions, which process multi-modal sensory data to directly generate refined control commands, have become a dominant paradigm in autonomous driving research. However, these approaches predominantly depend on single-vehicle data collection for model training and optimization, resulting in significant challenges such as high data acquisition and annotation costs, the scarcity of critical driving scenarios, and fragmented datasets that impede model generalization. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce RS2V-L, a novel framework for reconstructing and synthesizing vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor observations. Specifically, our method transforms roadside LiDAR point clouds into the vehicle-mounted LiDAR coordinate system by leveraging the target vehicle's relative pose. Subsequently, high-fidelity vehicle-mounted LiDAR data is synthesized through virtual LiDAR modeling, point cloud classification, and resampling techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to reconstruct vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the generated data into model training-complementing the KITTI dataset-enhances 3D object detection accuracy by over \text{30\%} while improving the efficiency of end-to-end autonomous driving data generation by more than an order of magnitude. These findings strongly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and underscore its potential in reducing dependence on costly vehicle-mounted data collection while improving the robustness of autonomous driving models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon self-examination, we have found that the data in the experimental section of our paper is uncertain.

| **[Object-Centric World Model for Language-Guided Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06170v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Case Study on Model Checking and Runtime Verification for Awkernel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09282v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In operating system development, concurrency poses significant challenges. It is difficult for humans to manually review concurrent behaviors or to write test cases covering all possible executions, often resulting in critical bugs. Preemption in schedulers serves as a typical example. This paper proposes a development method for concurrent software, such as schedulers. Our method incorporates model checking as an aid for tracing code, simplifying the analysis of concurrent behavior; we refer to this as model checking-assisted code review. While this approach aids in tracing behaviors, the accuracy of the results is limited because of the semantics gap between the modeling language and the programming language. Therefore, we also introduce runtime verification to address this limitation in model checking-assisted code review. We applied our approach to a real-world operating system, Awkernel, as a case study. This new operating system, currently under development for autonomous driving, is designed for preemptive task execution using asynchronous functions in Rust. After implementing our method, we identified several bugs that are difficult to detect through manual reviews or simple tests.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HisTrackMap: Global Vectorized High-Definition Map Construction via History Map Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07168v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an essential component of autonomous driving systems, high-definition (HD) maps provide rich and precise environmental information for auto-driving scenarios; however, existing methods, which primarily rely on query-based detection frameworks to directly model map elements or implicitly propagate queries over time, often struggle to maintain consistent temporal perception outcomes. These inconsistencies pose significant challenges to the stability and reliability of real-world autonomous driving and map data collection systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end tracking framework for global map construction by temporally tracking map elements' historical trajectories. Firstly, instance-level historical rasterization map representation is designed to explicitly store previous perception results, which can control and maintain different global instances' history information in a fine-grained way. Secondly, we introduce a Map-Trajectory Prior Fusion module within this tracking framework, leveraging historical priors for tracked instances to improve temporal smoothness and continuity. Thirdly, we propose a global perspective metric to evaluate the quality of temporal geometry construction in HD maps, filling the gap in current metrics for assessing global geometric perception results. Substantial experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both single-frame and temporal metrics.

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement. We present both, qualitative and quantitative results where we compare our generated cyclists against those from a recent stable diffusion-based method.</p></details> |  | None |

As Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) continue to expand, ground vehicles (GVs) face the challenge of handling huge amounts of sensor data to drive safely. Specifically, due to energy and capacity limitations, GVs will need to offload resource-hungry tasks to external (cloud) computing units for faster processing. In 6th generation (6G) wireless systems, the research community is exploring the concept of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), where satellites can serve as space edge computing nodes to aggregate, store, and process data from GVs. In this paper we propose new data offloading strategies between a cluster of GVs and satellites in the Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), to optimize the trade-off between coverage and end-to-end delay. For the accuracy of the simulations, we consider real data and orbits from the Starlink constellation, one of the most representative and popular examples of commercial satellite deployments for communication. Our results demonstrate that Starlink satellites can support real-time offloading under certain conditions that depend on the onboard computational capacity of the satellites, the frame rate of the sensors, and the number of GVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

| **[Simulator Ensembles for Trustworthy Autonomous Driving Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08936v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing with driving simulators is extensively used to identify failing conditions of automated driving assistance systems (ADAS) and reduce the amount of in-field road testing. However, existing studies have shown that repeated test execution in the same as well as in distinct simulators can yield different outcomes, which can be attributed to sources of flakiness or different implementations of the physics, among other factors. In this paper, we present MultiSim, a novel approach to multi-simulation ADAS testing based on a search-based testing approach that leverages an ensemble of simulators to identify failure-inducing, simulator-agnostic test scenarios. During the search, each scenario is evaluated jointly on multiple simulators. Scenarios that produce consistent results across simulators are prioritized for further exploration, while those that fail on only a subset of simulators are given less priority, as they may reflect simulator-specific issues rather than generalizable failures. Our case study, which involves testing a deep neural network-based ADAS on different pairs of three widely used simulators, demonstrates that MultiSim outperforms single-simulator testing by achieving on average a higher rate of simulator-agnostic failures by 51%. Compared to a state-of-the-art multi-simulator approach that combines the outcome of independent test generation campaigns obtained in different simulators, MultiSim identifies 54% more simulator-agnostic failing tests while showing a comparable validity rate. An enhancement of MultiSim that leverages surrogate models to predict simulator disagreements and bypass executions does not only increase the average number of valid failures but also improves efficiency in finding the first valid failure.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering advanced techniques for compressing point clouds more efficiently than conventional coding methods while also allowing effective computer vision tasks performed in the compressed domain thus, for the first time, making available a common compressed visual representation effective for both man and machine. Taking advantage of this potential, JPEG has recently finalized the JPEG Pleno Learning-based Point Cloud Coding (PCC) standard offering efficient lossy coding of static point clouds, targeting both human visualization and machine processing by leveraging deep learning models for geometry and color coding. The geometry is processed directly in its original 3D form using sparse convolutional neural networks, while the color data is projected onto 2D images and encoded using the also learning-based JPEG AI standard. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete technical description of the JPEG PCC standard, along with a thorough benchmarking of its performance against the state-of-the-art, while highlighting its main strengths and weaknesses. In terms of compression performance, JPEG PCC outperforms the conventional MPEG PCC standards, especially in geometry coding, achieving significant rate reductions. Color compression performance is less competitive but this is overcome by the power of a full learning-based coding framework for both geometry and color and the associated effective compressed domain processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 12 figures, accepted in IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

However, traditional cooperative methods are constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 11% higher success rate across diverse highly interactive V2V driving scenarios.

Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

The potential of leveraging planning in query design and interaction has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we introduce a multi-granularity planning query representation that integrates heterogeneous waypoints, including spatial, temporal, and driving-style waypoints across various sampling patterns. It provides additional supervision for trajectory prediction, enhancing precise closed-loop control for the ego vehicle. Additionally, we explicitly utilize the geometric properties of planning trajectories to effectively retrieve relevant image features based on physical locations using deformable attention. By combining these strategies, we propose a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework, termed HiP-AD, which simultaneously performs perception, prediction, and planning within a unified decoder. HiP-AD enables comprehensive interaction by allowing planning queries to iteratively interact with perception queries in the BEV space while dynamically extracting image features from perspective views. Experiments demonstrate that HiP-AD outperforms all existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods on the closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and achieves competitive performance on the real-world dataset nuScenes.</p></details> |  | None |

This is caused by the lack of large-scale annotated datasets on the one hand, and lack of methods that can robustly handle the sparse and often noisy LiDAR data in a reasonable time on the other hand. We address these limitations using a traffic simulation engine and present LiSu, the first large-scale, synthetic LiDAR point cloud dataset with ground truth surface normal annotations, eliminating the need for tedious manual labeling. Additionally, we propose a novel method that exploits the spatiotemporal characteristics of autonomous driving data to enhance surface normal estimation accuracy. By incorporating two regularization terms, we enforce spatial consistency among neighboring points and temporal smoothness across consecutive LiDAR frames. These regularizers are particularly effective in self-training settings, where they mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust real-world deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LiSu, achieving state-of-the-art performance in LiDAR surface normal estimation. Moreover, we showcase its full potential in addressing the challenging task of synthetic-to-real domain adaptation, leading to improved neural surface reconstruction on real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) strategies, designed atop standard chip architectures, are both cost-effective and adaptable to different architectures, making them particularly attractive. However, traditional ABFT relies on precise error metrics, triggering error recovery procedures even for minor computational deviations. These minor errors often do not impact the accuracy of the neural network model due to the inherent fault tolerance. To address this inefficiency, we propose an approximate ABFT approach, called ApproxABFT, which initiates error recovery only when computational errors are significant. This approach avoids unnecessary recovery procedures, streamlines the error recovery process, and focuses on correcting impactful errors, ultimately enhancing recovery quality. Additionally, ApproxABFT incorporates a fine-grained blocking strategy to smooth error sensitivity across layers within neural network models. Experimental results demonstrate that ApproxABFT reduces the computing overhead by 67.83\% and improves the tolerable bit error rate by an order of magnitude on average compared to classical accurate ABFT.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, despite the strong performance of PETR-based methods in 3D perception benchmarks, their direct INT8 quantization for onboard deployment leads to drastic accuracy drops-up to 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. In this work, we propose Q-PETR, a quantization-aware position embedding transformation that re-engineers key components of the PETR framework to reconcile the discrepancy between the dynamic ranges of positional encodings and image features, and to adapt the cross-attention mechanism for low-bit inference. By redesigning the positional encoding module and introducing an adaptive quantization strategy, Q-PETR maintains floating-point performance with a performance degradation of less than 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Moreover, compared to its FP32 counterpart, Q-PETR achieves a two-fold speedup and reduces memory usage by three times, thereby offering a deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained onboard devices. Extensive experiments across various PETR-series models validate the strong generalization and practical benefits of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets. V-Max integrates a set of observation and reward functions, transformer-based encoders, and training pipelines.

Existing methods typically generate a single data form directly from a coarse scene layout, which not only fails to output rich data forms required for diverse downstream tasks but also struggles to model the direct layout-to-data distribution. In this paper, we introduce UniScene, the first unified framework for generating three key data forms - semantic occupancy, video, and LiDAR - in driving scenes. UniScene employs a progressive generation process that decomposes the complex task of scene generation into two hierarchical steps: (a) first generating semantic occupancy from a customized scene layout as a meta scene representation rich in both semantic and geometric information, and then (b) conditioned on occupancy, generating video and LiDAR data, respectively, with two novel transfer strategies of Gaussian-based Joint Rendering and Prior-guided Sparse Modeling. This occupancy-centric approach reduces the generation burden, especially for intricate scenes, while providing detailed intermediate representations for the subsequent generation stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniScene outperforms previous SOTAs in the occupancy, video, and LiDAR generation, which also indeed benefits downstream driving tasks.

However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), collecting and processing limited scene-aware contexts. Instead, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors like LiDAR offer rich depth information and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Meanwhile, the emerging 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is capable of detecting the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. Therefore, the integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, enabling more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, in this paper, we exploratively propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar contexts. To adaptively balance the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we have designed a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds dual-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Additionally, we have designed a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we innovatively devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge. Our experiments have demonstrated that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures | None |

While end-to-end models trained on large datasets perform well in standard driving scenarios, they struggle with complex low-frequency events. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) advancements offer enhanced reasoning but suffer from computational inefficiency. Inspired by the dual-process cognitive model "Thinking, Fast and Slow", we propose $\textbf{FASIONAD}$ -- a novel dual-system framework that synergizes a fast end-to-end planner with a VLM-based reasoning module. The fast system leverages end-to-end learning to achieve real-time trajectory generation in common scenarios, while the slow system activates through uncertainty estimation to perform contextual analysis and complex scenario resolution. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A dynamic switching mechanism enabling slow system intervention based on real-time uncertainty assessment; (2) An information bottleneck with high-level plan feedback that optimizes the slow system's guidance capability; (3) A bidirectional knowledge exchange where visual prompts enhance the slow system's reasoning while its feedback refines the fast planner's decision-making. To strengthen VLM reasoning, we develop a question-answering mechanism coupled with reward-instruct training strategy. In open-loop experiments, FASIONAD achieves a $6.7\%$ reduction in average $L2$ trajectory error and $28.1\%$ lower collision rate.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, the lack of quality datasets hinders research and development. We report a new method that is able to simulate 4D millimeter wave radar signals including pitch, yaw, range, and Doppler velocity along with radar signal strength (RSS) using camera image, light detection and ranging (lidar) point cloud, and ego-velocity. The method is based on two new neural networks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of radar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on appearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method using open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The experimental results show that our method can successfully generate high-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object detection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar. The network outperforms the counterpart trained only on raw radar data, a promising result to facilitate future radar-based research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one task and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks, achieving a 10.7% improvement in challenging rare perception scenarios and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

A powerful autonomous driving system should be capable of handling images under all conditions, including nighttime. Generating accurate and diverse nighttime semantic segmentation datasets is crucial for enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms in low-light conditions. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach named NPSim, which enables the simulation of realistic nighttime images from real daytime counterparts with monocular inverse rendering and ray tracing. NPSim comprises two key components: mesh reconstruction and relighting. The mesh reconstruction component generates an accurate representation of the scene structure by combining geometric information extracted from the input RGB image and semantic information from its corresponding semantic labels. The relighting component integrates real-world nighttime light sources and material characteristics to simulate the complex interplay of light and object surfaces under low-light conditions. The scope of this thesis mainly focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the mesh reconstruction component. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh reconstruction component in producing high-quality scene meshes and their generality across different autonomous driving datasets. We also propose a detailed experiment plan for evaluating the entire pipeline, including both quantitative metrics in training state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches and human perceptual studies, aiming to indicate the capability of our approach to generate realistic nighttime images and the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

In autonomous driving, recent end-to-end models have greatly improved planning performance but still struggle with long-tailed problems due to limited common sense and reasoning abilities. Some studies integrate vision-language models (VLMs) into autonomous driving, but they typically rely on pre-trained models with simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on driving data, without further exploration of training strategies or optimizations specifically tailored for planning. In this paper, we propose AlphaDrive, a RL and reasoning framework for VLMs in autonomous driving. AlphaDrive introduces four GRPO-based RL rewards tailored for planning and employs a two-stage planning reasoning training strategy that combines SFT with RL. As a result, AlphaDrive significantly improves both planning performance and training efficiency compared to using only SFT or without reasoning. Moreover, we are also excited to discover that, following RL training, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities, which is critical for improving driving safety and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, AlphaDrive is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with planning reasoning into autonomous driving.

To study this, we create the Robusto-1 dataset that uses dashcam video data from Peru, a country with one of the worst (aggressive) drivers in the world, a high traffic index, and a high ratio of bizarre to non-bizarre street objects likely never seen in training. In particular, to preliminarly test at a cognitive level how well Foundational Visual Language Models (VLMs) compare to Humans in Driving, we move away from bounding boxes, segmentation maps, occupancy maps or trajectory estimation to multi-modal Visual Question Answering (VQA) comparing both humans and machines through a popular method in systems neuroscience known as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Depending on the type of questions we ask and the answers these systems give, we will show in what cases do VLMs and Humans converge or diverge allowing us to probe on their cognitive alignment. We find that the degree of alignment varies significantly depending on the type of questions asked to each type of system (Humans vs VLMs), highlighting a gap in their alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A pre-print. 26 pages.

This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance.

One often overlooked aspect is the uncertainty of planned trajectories predicted by these systems, despite awareness of their own uncertainty being key to achieve safety and robustness. We propose to estimate this uncertainty by adapting loss prediction from the uncertainty quantification literature. To this end, we introduce a novel light-weight module, dubbed CATPlan, that is trained to decode motion and planning embeddings into estimates of the collision loss used to partially supervise end-to-end AD systems. During inference, these estimates are interpreted as collision risk. We evaluate CATPlan on the safety-critical, nerf-based, closed-loop benchmark NeuroNCAP and find that it manages to detect collisions with a $54.8\%$ relative improvement to average precision over a GMM-based baseline in which the predicted trajectory is compared to the forecasted trajectories of other road users. Our findings indicate that the addition of CATPlan can lead to safer end-to-end AD systems and hope that our work will spark increased interest in uncertainty quantification for such systems.</p></details> |  | None |

GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features.

On the other hand, occupancy-based class-agnostic methods excel in representing scenes but fail to ensure physics consistency and ignore the importance of interactions between traffic participants, hindering the model's ability to learn accurate and reliable motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel occupancy-instance modeling framework for class-agnostic motion prediction tasks, named LEGO-Motion, which incorporates instance features into Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. Our model comprises (1) a BEV encoder, (2) an Interaction-Augmented Instance Encoder, and (3) an Instance-Enhanced BEV Encoder, improving both interaction relationships and physics consistency within the model, thereby ensuring a more accurate and robust understanding of the environment.

However, existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the 3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes. Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving 1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to 36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there still exist fundamental challenges: deeply coupled fusion methods assume continuous sensor availability, making them vulnerable to sensor degradation and failure, whereas sensor-wise cross-attention fusion methods struggle with computational cost and unified feature representation. This paper presents availability-aware sensor fusion (ASF), a novel method that employs unified canonical projection (UCP) to enable consistency in all sensor features for fusion and cross-attention across sensors along patches (CASAP) to enhance robustness of sensor fusion against sensor degradation and failure. As a result, the proposed ASF shows a superior object detection performance to the existing state-of-the-art fusion methods under various weather and sensor degradation (or failure) conditions; Extensive experiments on the K-Radar dataset demonstrate that ASF achieves improvements of 9.7% in AP BEV (87.2%) and 20.1% in AP 3D (73.6%) in object detection at IoU=0.5, while requiring a low computational cost.

Current protocols typically respond with immediate stops or minimal-risk maneuvers, worsening traffic flow and lacking flexibility for rare driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents. To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous driving resilience against adverse perception deficits. Our results also show that LLMs fine-tuned with DriveLM-Deficit can enable more proactive movements instead of conservative stops in the context of perception deficits.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-world applications demand more than visually plausible predictions; they require reasoning about object motions based on explicitly defined boundary conditions, such as initial scene image and partial object motion. We term this capability Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning. Current approaches either neglect explicit user-defined motion constraints, producing physically inconsistent motions, or conversely demand complete motion inputs, which are rarely available in practice. Here we introduce Motion Dreamer, a two-stage framework that explicitly separates motion reasoning from visual synthesis, addressing these limitations. Our approach introduces instance flow, a sparse-to-dense motion representation enabling effective integration of partial user-defined motions, and the motion inpainting strategy to robustly enable reasoning motions of other objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Dreamer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior motion plausibility and visual realism, thus bridging the gap towards practical boundary conditional motion reasoning.

Our proposed framework, termed the "World-Centric Diffusion Transformer"(WcDT), optimizes the entire trajectory generation process, from feature extraction to model inference. To enhance the scene diversity and stochasticity, the historical trajectory data is first preprocessed into "Agent Move Statement" and encoded into latent space using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) enhanced with Diffusion with Transformer (DiT) blocks. Then, the latent features, historical trajectories, HD map features, and historical traffic signal information are fused with various transformer-based encoders that are used to enhance the interaction of agents with other elements in the traffic scene. The encoded traffic scenes are then decoded by a trajectory decoder to generate multimodal future trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance in generating both realistic and diverse trajectories, showing its potential for integration into automatic driving simulation systems.

BEV mapping models need to be applied to the unlabeled real world, making the study of unsupervised domain adaptation models an essential path. However, research on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and cannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this paper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation framework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that solely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper explores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct levels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists of three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision (SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum Mixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective feature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation models in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by spatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an intermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels, thereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding perspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of view frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which guides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV labels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as BEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping.

When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments.

However, the complex and highly dynamic nature of traffic environments presents significant challenges in accurately rendering these scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach, which incorporates context and temporal deformation awareness to improve dynamic scene rendering. Specifically, we employ a 2D semantic segmentation foundation model to self-supervise the 4D semantic features of Gaussians, ensuring meaningful contextual embedding. Simultaneously, we track the temporal deformation of each Gaussian across adjacent frames. By aggregating and encoding both semantic and temporal deformation features, each Gaussian is equipped with cues for potential deformation compensation within 3D space, facilitating a more precise representation of dynamic scenes. Experimental results show that our method improves 4DGS's ability to capture fine details in dynamic scene rendering for autonomous driving and outperforms other self-supervised methods in 4D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, CoDa-4DGS deforms semantic features with each Gaussian, enabling broader applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing world models often suffer from low prediction fidelity and compounding one-step errors, leading to policy degradation over long horizons. Additionally, traditional RL policies, often deterministic or single Gaussian-based, fail to capture the multi-modal nature of decision-making in complex driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Imagine-2-Drive, a novel WMRL framework that integrates a high-fidelity world model with a multi-modal diffusion-based policy actor. It consists of two key components: DiffDreamer, a diffusion-based world model that generates future observations simultaneously, mitigating error accumulation, and DPA (Diffusion Policy Actor), a diffusion-based policy that models diverse and multi-modal trajectory distributions. By training DPA within DiffDreamer, our method enables robust policy learning with minimal online interactions. We evaluate our method in CARLA using standard driving benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms prior world model baselines, improving Route Completion and Success Rate by 15% and 20% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

We introduce PixelSHAP, a model-agnostic framework extending Shapley-based analysis to structured visual entities. Unlike previous methods focusing on text prompts, PixelSHAP applies to vision-based reasoning by systematically perturbing image objects and quantifying their influence on a VLM's response. PixelSHAP requires no model internals, operating solely on input-output pairs, making it compatible with open-source and commercial models. It supports diverse embedding-based similarity metrics and scales efficiently using optimization techniques inspired by Shapley-based methods. We validate PixelSHAP in autonomous driving, highlighting its ability to enhance interpretability. Key challenges include segmentation sensitivity and object occlusion.

Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  | None |

While standard loss functions such as cross-entropy and Dice loss perform well in general cases, they often struggle with fine structures, particularly in tasks involving thin structures or closely packed objects. Various weight map-based loss functions have been proposed to address this issue by assigning higher loss weights to pixels prone to misclassification. However, these methods typically rely on precomputed or runtime-generated weight maps based on distance transforms, which impose significant computational costs and fail to adapt to evolving network predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel steerable pyramid-based weighted (SPW) loss function that efficiently generates adaptive weight maps. Unlike traditional boundary-aware losses that depend on static or iteratively updated distance maps, our method leverages steerable pyramids to dynamically emphasize regions across multiple frequency bands (capturing features at different scales) while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, by incorporating network predictions into the weight computation, our approach enables adaptive refinement during training. We evaluate our method on the SNEMI3D, GlaS, and DRIVE datasets, benchmarking it against 11 state-of-the-art loss functions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SPW loss function achieves superior pixel precision and segmentation accuracy with minimal computational overhead. This work provides an effective and efficient solution for improving semantic segmentation, particularly for applications requiring multiscale feature representation.

| **[StructVPR++: Distill Structural and Semantic Knowledge with Weighting Samples for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06601v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition is a challenging task for autonomous driving and robotics, which is usually considered as an image retrieval problem. A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Future-Aware Interaction Network For Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06565v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems, enabling the generation of accurate and smooth future trajectories to ensure safe navigation to the destination. In previous methods, potential future trajectories are often absent in the scene encoding stage, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, prior approaches typically employ transformer architectures for spatiotemporal modeling of trajectories and map information, which suffer from the quadratic scaling complexity of the transformer architecture. In this work, we propose an interaction-based method, named Future-Aware Interaction Network, that introduces potential future trajectories into scene encoding for a comprehensive traffic representation. Furthermore, a State Space Model (SSM), specifically Mamba, is introduced for both spatial and temporal modeling. To adapt Mamba for spatial interaction modeling, we propose an adaptive reordering strategy that transforms unordered data into a structured sequence. Additionally, Mamba is employed to refine generated future trajectories temporally, ensuring more consistent predictions. These enhancements not only improve model efficiency but also enhance the accuracy and diversity of predictions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the widely used Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches in a more efficient way. The code will be released according to the acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

As interactive components within autonomous driving systems, VLMs must maintain strong safety cognition during interactions. From this perspective, we propose a novel evaluation method: Safety Cognitive Driving Benchmark (SCD-Bench) . To address the large-scale annotation challenge for SCD-Bench, we develop the Autonomous Driving Image-Text Annotation System (ADA) . Additionally, to ensure data quality in SCD-Bench, our dataset undergoes manual refinement by experts with professional knowledge in autonomous driving. We further develop an automated evaluation method based on large language models (LLMs). To verify its effectiveness, we compare its evaluation results with those of expert human evaluations, achieving a consistency rate of 99.74%. Preliminary experimental results indicate that existing open-source models still lack sufficient safety cognition, showing a significant gap compared to GPT-4o. Notably, lightweight models (1B-4B) demonstrate minimal safety cognition. However, since lightweight models are crucial for autonomous driving systems, this presents a significant challenge for integrating VLMs into the field.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches achieve this by connecting traditional 3D object detectors with vision-language models (VLMs) to regress 3D bounding boxes for novel objects and perform open-vocabulary classification through cross-modal alignment between 3D and 2D features. However, achieving robust cross-modal alignment remains a challenge due to semantic inconsistencies when generating corresponding 3D and 2D feature pairs. To overcome this challenge, we present OV-SCAN, an Open-Vocabulary 3D framework that enforces Semantically Consistent Alignment for Novel object discovery. OV-SCAN employs two core strategies: discovering precise 3D annotations and filtering out low-quality or corrupted alignment pairs (arising from 3D annotation, occlusion-induced, or resolution-induced noise). Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that OV-SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the high computational costs of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, this paper introduces TwinLiteNetPlus, a model capable of balancing efficiency and accuracy. TwinLiteNetPlus incorporates standard and depth-wise separable dilated convolutions, reducing complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It is available in four configurations, from the robust 1.94 million-parameter TwinLiteNetPlus_{Large} to the ultra-lightweight 34K-parameter TwinLiteNetPlus_{Nano}. Notably, TwinLiteNetPlus_{Large} attains a 92.9% mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) for Drivable Area Segmentation and a 34.2% IoU (Intersection over Union) for Lane Segmentation. These results achieve remarkable performance, surpassing current state-of-the-art models while only requiring 11 times fewer Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) for computation. Rigorously evaluated on various embedded devices, TwinLiteNetPlus demonstrates promising latency and power efficiency, underscoring its potential for real-world autonomous vehicle applications.

This paper introduces an integrated approach combining advanced deep learning techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for comprehensive road perception. For traffic sign recognition, we systematically evaluate ResNet-50, YOLOv8, and RT-DETR, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 99.8% with ResNet-50, 98.0% accuracy with YOLOv8, and achieved 96.6% accuracy in RT-DETR despite its higher computational complexity. For lane detection, we propose a CNN-based segmentation method enhanced by polynomial curve fitting, which delivers high accuracy under favorable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight, Multimodal, LLM-based framework that directly undergoes instruction tuning using small yet diverse datasets, eliminating the need for initial pretraining. This framework effectively handles various lane types, complex intersections, and merging zones, significantly enhancing lane detection reliability by reasoning under adverse conditions. Despite constraints in available training resources, our multimodal approach demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities, achieving a Frame Overall Accuracy (FRM) of 53.87%, a Question Overall Accuracy (QNS) of 82.83%, lane detection accuracies of 99.6% in clear conditions and 93.0% at night, and robust performance in reasoning about lane invisibility due to rain (88.4%) or road degradation (95.6%).

While deep models achieve strong performance, their efficiency remains a challenge. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique, but existing feature-based KD methods rely on static, teacher-driven feature selection, failing to adapt to the student's evolving learning state or leverage dynamic student-teacher interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive student-teacher Cooperative Attention Masking for Knowledge Distillation (ACAM-KD), which introduces two key components: (1) Student-Teacher Cross-Attention Feature Fusion (STCA-FF), which adaptively integrates features from both models for a more interactive distillation process, and (2) Adaptive Spatial-Channel Masking (ASCM), which dynamically generates importance masks to enhance both spatial and channel-wise feature selection. Unlike conventional KD methods, ACAM-KD adapts to the student's evolving needs throughout the entire distillation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. For instance, on COCO2017, ACAM-KD improves object detection performance by up to 1.4 mAP over the state-of-the-art when distilling a ResNet-50 student from a ResNet-101 teacher. For semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, it boosts mIoU by 3.09 over the baseline with DeepLabV3-MobileNetV2 as the student model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 tables, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

To address this, we introduce the first generalized cross-domain few-shot (GCFS) task in 3D object detection, which focuses on adapting a source-pretrained model for high performance on both common and novel classes in a target domain with few-shot samples. Our solution integrates multi-modal fusion and contrastive-enhanced prototype learning within one framework, holistically overcoming challenges related to data scarcity and domain adaptation in the GCFS setting. The multi-modal fusion module utilizes 2D vision-language models to extract rich, open-set semantic knowledge. To address biases in point distributions across varying structural complexities, we particularly introduce a physically-aware box searching strategy that leverages laser imaging principles to generate high-quality 3D box proposals from 2D insights, enhancing object recall. To effectively capture domain-specific representations for each class from limited target data, we further propose a contrastive-enhanced prototype learning, which strengthens the model's adaptability. We evaluate our approach with three GCFS benchmark settings, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for GCFS tasks.

To address this limitation, we propose SAMEO, a novel framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a versatile mask decoder capable of interfacing with various front-end detectors to enable mask prediction even for partially occluded objects. Acknowledging the constraints of limited amodal segmentation datasets, we introduce Amodal-LVIS, a large-scale synthetic dataset comprising 300K images derived from the modal LVIS and LVVIS datasets.

Although sparse-point methods lower computational load and maintain high accuracy in complex lane geometries, current methods fail to fully leverage the geometric structure of lanes in both lane geometry representations and model design. In lane geometry representations, we present a theoretical analysis alongside experimental validation to verify that current sparse lane representation methods contain inherent flaws, resulting in potential errors of up to 20 m, which raise significant safety concerns for driving. To address this issue, we propose a novel patching strategy to completely represent the full lane structure. To enable existing models to match this strategy, we introduce the EndPoint head (EP-head), which adds a patching distance to endpoints. The EP-head enables the model to predict more complete lane representations even with fewer preset points, effectively addressing existing limitations and paving the way for models that are faster and require fewer parameters in the future. In model design, to enhance the model's perception of lane structures, we propose the PointLane attention (PL-attention), which incorporates prior geometric knowledge into the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on various state-of-the-art models.

To address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal planner.

However, the presence of dynamic objects in the scene seriously affects the accuracy of the model inferring 3D structures from 2D images. Existing methods simply stack multiple frames of image input to increase dense scene semantic information, but ignore the fact that dynamic objects and non-texture areas violate multi-view consistency and matching reliability. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, CDScene: Vision-based Robust Semantic Scene Completion via Capturing Dynamic Representations. First, we leverage a multimodal large-scale model to extract 2D explicit semantics and align them into 3D space. Second, we exploit the characteristics of monocular and stereo depth to decouple scene information into dynamic and static features. The dynamic features contain structural relationships around dynamic objects, and the static features contain dense contextual spatial information. Finally, we design a dynamic-static adaptive fusion module to effectively extract and aggregate complementary features, achieving robust and accurate semantic scene completion in autonomous driving scenarios. Extensive experimental results on the SemanticKITTI, SSCBench-KITTI360, and SemanticKITTI-C datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of CDScene over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method VLScene: Vision-Language Guidance Distillation for Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion. The key insight is to use the vision-language model to introduce high-level semantic priors to provide the object spatial context required for 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we design a vision-language guidance distillation process to enhance image features, which can effectively capture semantic knowledge from the surrounding environment and improve spatial context reasoning. In addition, we introduce a geometric-semantic sparse awareness mechanism to propagate geometric structures in the neighborhood and enhance semantic information through contextual sparse interactions.

However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security.

| **[Learning to Drive by Imitating Surrounding Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05997v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a promising approach for training autonomous vehicles (AV) to navigate complex traffic environments by mimicking expert driver behaviors. However, a major challenge in this paradigm lies in effectively utilizing available driving data, as collecting new data is resource-intensive and often limited in its ability to cover diverse driving scenarios. While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation strategy that enhances imitation learning by leveraging the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured through the AV's sensors, as additional expert demonstrations. We introduce a vehicle selection sampling strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer and more diverse dataset for training. We evaluate our approach using the state-of-the-art learning-based planning method PLUTO on the nuPlan dataset and demonstrate that our augmentation method leads to improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, our method reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10% of the original dataset, our method achieves performance comparable to that of the full dataset, with improved collision rates. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Explainability is especially important for safety-critical applications, and due to the variety of object detectors and their often proprietary nature, black-box explainability tools are needed. However, existing black-box explainability tools for AI models rely on multiple model calls, rendering them impractical for real-time use. In this paper, we introduce IncX, an algorithm and a tool for real-time black-box explainability for object detectors. The algorithm is based on linear transformations of saliency maps, producing sufficient explanations. We evaluate our implementation on four widely used video datasets of autonomous driving and demonstrate that IncX's explanations are comparable in quality to the state-of-the-art and are computed two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, making them usable in real time.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, existing solutions often rely on carefully crafted, task specific extrinsic rewards, limiting generalization to new tasks or environments. In this paper, we propose InDRiVE (Intrinsic Disagreement based Reinforcement for Vehicle Exploration), a method that leverages purely intrinsic, disagreement based rewards within a Dreamer based MBRL framework. By training an ensemble of world models, the agent actively explores high uncertainty regions of environments without any task specific feedback. This approach yields a task agnostic latent representation, allowing for rapid zero shot or few shot fine tuning on downstream driving tasks such as lane following and collision avoidance. Experimental results in both seen and unseen environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves higher success rates and fewer infractions compared to DreamerV2 and DreamerV3 baselines despite using significantly fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of purely intrinsic exploration for learning robust vehicle control behaviors, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IROS 2025 and is currently under review</p></details> | None |

Current vectorized map reconstruction methods based on the DETR framework encounter limitations due to the redundancy in the decoder structure, necessitating the stacking of six decoder layers to maintain performance, which significantly hampers computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we introduce FastMap, an innovative framework designed to reduce decoder redundancy in existing approaches. FastMap optimizes the decoder architecture by employing a single-layer, two-stage transformer that achieves multilevel representation capabilities. Our framework eliminates the conventional practice of randomly initializing queries and instead incorporates a heatmap-guided query generation module during the decoding phase, which effectively maps image features into structured query vectors using learnable positional encoding. Additionally, we propose a geometry-constrained point-to-line loss mechanism for FastMap, which adeptly addresses the challenge of distinguishing highly homogeneous features that often arise in traditional point-to-point loss computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastMap achieves state-of-the-art performance in both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, with its decoder operating 3.2 faster than the baseline.

Unlike prior methods focused on synthetic data or elastic jittering along the contact surface, which prevent objects from fully detaching or moving independently, DecoupledGaussian allows for significant positional changes without being constrained by the initial contacted surface. Recognizing the limitations of current 2D inpainting tools for restoring 3D locations, our approach proposes joint Poisson fields to repair and expand the Gaussians of both objects and contacted scenes after separation. This is complemented by a multi-carve strategy to refine the object's geometry. Our system enables realistic simulations of decoupling motions, collisions, and fractures driven by user-specified impulses, supporting complex interactions within and across multiple scenes. We validate DecoupledGaussian through a comprehensive user study and quantitative benchmarks. This system enhances digital interaction with objects and scenes in real-world environments, benefiting industries such as VR, robotics, and autonomous driving.

| **[PRAM: Place Recognition Anywhere Model for Efficient Visual Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07785v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual localization is a key technique to a variety of applications, e.g., autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics. For these real applications, both efficiency and accuracy are important especially on edge devices with limited computing resources. However, previous frameworks, e.g., absolute pose regression (APR), scene coordinate regression (SCR), and the hierarchical method (HM), have limited either accuracy or efficiency in both indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose the place recognition anywhere model (PRAM), a new framework, to perform visual localization efficiently and accurately by recognizing 3D landmarks. Specifically, PRAM first generates landmarks directly in 3D space in a self-supervised manner. Without relying on commonly used classic semantic labels, these 3D landmarks can be defined in any place in indoor and outdoor scenes with higher generalization ability. Representing the map with 3D landmarks, PRAM discards global descriptors, repetitive local descriptors, and redundant 3D points, increasing the memory efficiency significantly. Then, sparse keypoints, rather than dense pixels, are utilized as the input tokens to a transformer-based recognition module for landmark recognition, which enables PRAM to recognize hundreds of landmarks with high time and memory efficiency. At test time, sparse keypoints and predicted landmark labels are utilized for outlier removal and landmark-wise 2D-3D matching as opposed to exhaustive 2D-2D matching, which further increases the time efficiency. A comprehensive evaluation of APRs, SCRs, HMs, and PRAM on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates that PRAM outperforms ARPs and SCRs in large-scale scenes with a large margin and gives competitive accuracy to HMs but reduces over 90\% memory cost and runs 2.4 times faster, leading to a better balance between efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://feixue94.github.io/pram-project/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://feixue94.github.io/pram-project) |

Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains.

However, existing E2E-AD methods usually adopt the sequential paradigm of perception-prediction-planning, which leads to cumulative errors and training instability. The manual ordering of tasks also limits the system`s ability to leverage synergies between tasks (for example, planning-aware perception and game-theoretic interactive prediction and planning). Moreover, the dense BEV representation adopted by existing methods brings computational challenges for long-range perception and long-term temporal fusion. To address these challenges, we present DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework for the ease of scaling up, characterized by three key features: Task Parallelism (All agent, map, and planning queries direct interact with each other at each block), Sparse Representation (Task queries direct interact with raw sensor features), and Streaming Processing (Task queries are stored and passed as history information). As a result, the new framework is composed of three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, temporal cross-attention, which significantly reduces the complexity of system and leads to better training stability. DriveTransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and real world open-loop benchmark nuScenes with high FPS.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 | None |

The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function.

While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

We discretize these styles with quantization, and the styles are used to learn a conditional diffusion policy for simulating human drivers. Our empirical evaluation confirms that the behaviors generated by our approach are both safer and more human-like than those of the machine-learning-based baseline methods. We believe this has the potential to enable higher realism and more effective techniques for evaluating and improving the performance of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

Nowadays, LiDAR inertial odometry becomes increasingly prevalent in robotics and autonomous driving. However, many current SLAM systems lack sufficient adaptability to various scenarios. Challenges include decreased point cloud accuracy with longer frame intervals under the constant velocity assumption, coupling of erroneous IMU information when IMU saturation occurs, and decreased localization accuracy due to the use of fixed-resolution maps during indoor-outdoor scene transitions. To address these issues, we propose a loosely coupled adaptive LiDAR-Inertial-Odometry named \textbf{Adaptive-LIO}, which incorporates adaptive segmentation to enhance mapping accuracy, adapts motion modality through IMU saturation and fault detection, and adjusts map resolution adaptively using multi-resolution voxel maps based on the distance from the LiDAR center.

Traditional methods often struggle with occlusions, variable lighting conditions, and the structural variability of crop rows. To address these challenges, RowDetr, a novel end-to-end neural network architecture, is introduced for robust and efficient row detection. A new dataset of approximately 6,900 images is curated, capturing a diverse range of real-world agricultural conditions, including occluded rows, uneven terrain, and varying crop densities. Unlike previous approaches, RowDetr leverages smooth polynomial functions to precisely delineate crop boundaries in the image space, ensuring a more structured and interpretable representation of row geometry. A key innovation of this approach is PolyOptLoss, a novel energy-based loss function designed to enhance learning robustness, even in the presence of noisy or imperfect labels. This loss function significantly improves model stability and generalization by optimizing polynomial curve fitting directly in image space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RowDetr significantly outperforms existing frameworks, including Agronav and RowColAttention, across key performance metrics. Additionally, RowDetr achieves a sixfold speedup over Agronav, making it highly suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To facilitate better comparisons across future studies, lane detection metrics from autonomous driving research are adapted, providing a more standardized and meaningful evaluation framework for crop row detection.

Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance.

Specifically, trajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for specific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate future predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for low-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some work has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized autonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles for trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most certainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case scenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic psychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets for trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving styles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving styles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with edge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing real-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the lens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of risks, including not only collision risks but also traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in the Carla simulator.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention. They overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However, most existing methods explore cross-modality correlations through feature-level or descriptor-level fusion, suffering from a lack of interpretability. Conversely, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new perspective on multimodal fusion by harmonizing different modalities into an explicit scene representation. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph convolution and transformer is designed to extract spatio-temporal features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition.

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits.

We then propose a deep-learning-based risk prediction network that uses the first two categories of factors as inputs. The network captures the interactive relationships among traffic participants in dynamic driving scenarios. Additionally, we design a personalized modeling strategy that incorporates driver-specific traits to improve prediction accuracy. To ensure high-quality training data, we conducted a rigorous video rating experiment. Experimental results show that the proposed network achieves a 10.0% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Recent range-view LiDAR segmentation approaches show promise for real-time processing. However, they inevitably suffer from corrupted contextual information and rely heavily on post-processing techniques for prediction refinement. In this work, we propose FRNet, a simple yet powerful method aimed at restoring the contextual information of range image pixels using corresponding frustum LiDAR points. First, a frustum feature encoder module is used to extract per-point features within the frustum region, which preserves scene consistency and is critical for point-level predictions. Next, a frustum-point fusion module is introduced to update per-point features hierarchically, enabling each point to extract more surrounding information through the frustum features. Finally, a head fusion module is used to fuse features at different levels for final semantic predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on four popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks under various task setups demonstrate the superiority of FRNet.

| **[Cross-Modal Prototype based Multimodal Federated Learning under Severely Missing Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13898v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal federated learning (MFL) has emerged as a decentralized machine learning paradigm, allowing multiple clients with different modalities to collaborate on training a global model across diverse data sources without sharing their private data. However, challenges, such as data heterogeneity and severely missing modalities, pose crucial hindrances to the robustness of MFL, significantly impacting the performance of global model. The occurrence of missing modalities in real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, often arises from factors like sensor failures, leading knowledge gaps during the training process. Specifically, the absence of a modality introduces misalignment during the local training phase, stemming from zero-filling in the case of clients with missing modalities. Consequently, achieving robust generalization in global model becomes imperative, especially when dealing with clients that have incomplete data. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{Multimodal Federated Cross Prototype Learning (MFCPL)}$, a novel approach for MFL under severely missing modalities. Our MFCPL leverages the complete prototypes to provide diverse modality knowledge in modality-shared level with the cross-modal regularization and modality-specific level with cross-modal contrastive mechanism. Additionally, our approach introduces the cross-modal alignment to provide regularization for modality-specific features, thereby enhancing the overall performance, particularly in scenarios involving severely missing modalities. Through extensive experiments on three multimodal datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MFCPL in mitigating the challenges of data heterogeneity and severely missing modalities while improving the overall performance and robustness of MFL.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose the Momentum-Aware Driving (MomAD) framework, which introduces trajectory momentum and perception momentum to stabilize and refine trajectory predictions. MomAD comprises two core components: (1) Topological Trajectory Matching (TTM) employs Hausdorff Distance to select the optimal planning query that aligns with prior paths to ensure coherence;(2) Momentum Planning Interactor (MPI) cross-attends the selected planning query with historical queries to expand static and dynamic perception files. This enriched query, in turn, helps regenerate long-horizon trajectory and reduce collision risks. To mitigate noise arising from dynamic environments and detection errors, we introduce robust instance denoising during training, enabling the planning model to focus on critical signals and improve its robustness. We also propose a novel Trajectory Prediction Consistency (TPC) metric to quantitatively assess planning stability. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MomAD achieves superior long-term consistency (>=3s) compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, evaluations on the curated Turning-nuScenes shows that MomAD reduces the collision rate by 26% and improves TPC by 0.97m (33.45%) over a 6s prediction horizon, while closedloop on Bench2Drive demonstrates an up to 16.3% improvement in success rate.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures | None |

Each 3D Gaussian function represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features, which are iteratively refined by the attention mechanism. In the experiment, it is found that the Gaussian function required by this method is larger than the query resolution of the original dense grid network, resulting in impaired performance. Therefore, we consider optimizing GaussianFormer by using unused temporal information. We learn the Spatial-Temporal Self-attention Mechanism from the previous grid-given occupation network and improve it to GaussianFormer. The experiment was conducted with the NuScenes dataset, and the experiment is currently underway.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, conventional monocular visual odometry encoun-ters challenges in scale estimation due to the absence of depth information during projection. Previous methodologies, whether rooted in physical constraints or deep learning paradigms, con-tend with issues related to computational complexity and the management of dynamic objects. This study extends our prior research, presenting innovative strategies for ego-motion estima-tion and the selection of ground points. Striving for a nuanced equilibrium between computational efficiency and precision, we propose a hybrid method that leverages the SegNeXt model for real-time applications, encompassing both ego-motion estimation and ground point selection. Our methodology incorporates dy-namic object masks to eliminate unstable features and employs ground plane masks for meticulous triangulation. Furthermore, we exploit Geometry-constraint to delineate road regions for scale recovery. The integration of this approach with the mo-nocular version of ORB-SLAM3 culminates in the accurate esti-mation of a road model, a pivotal component in our scale recov-ery process. Rigorous experiments, conducted on the KITTI da-taset, systematically compare our method with existing monocu-lar visual odometry algorithms and contemporary scale recovery methodologies. The results undeniably confirm the superior ef-fectiveness of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms.

Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a significant improvement in safety and stability of Lane Changing maneuver.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods, however, are computationally expensive, requiring costly attention-based 2D-3D transformation and 3D feature processing. In this paper, we present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, H3O, which features highly efficient architecture designs that incur a significantly lower computational cost as compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, to compensate for the ambiguity in ground-truth 3D occupancy labels, we advocate leveraging auxiliary tasks to complement the direct 3D supervision. In particular, we integrate multi-camera depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and surface normal estimation via differentiable volume rendering, supervised by corresponding 2D labels that introduces rich and heterogeneous supervision signals.

Despite a proliferation of promising approaches, progress is stifled by the difficulty of deploying experimental planners in naturalistic settings. In this work, we propose Lab2Car, an optimization-based wrapper that can take a trajectory sketch from an arbitrary motion planner and convert it to a safe, comfortable, dynamically feasible trajectory that the car can follow. This allows motion planners that do not provide such guarantees to be safely tested and optimized in real-world environments. We demonstrate the versatility of Lab2Car by using it to deploy a machine learning (ML) planner and a classical planner on self-driving cars in Las Vegas. The resulting systems handle challenging scenarios, such as cut-ins, overtaking, and yielding, in complex urban environments like casino pick-up/drop-off areas.

However, most existing planning methods rely heavily on imitation learning, which limits their ability to leverage collision data effectively. Moreover, collecting collision or near-collision data is inherently challenging, as it involves risks and raises ethical and practical concerns. In this paper, we propose SafeFusion, a training framework to learn from collision data. Instead of over-relying on imitation learning, SafeFusion integrates safety-oriented metrics during training to enable collision avoidance learning. In addition, to address the scarcity of collision data, we propose CollisionGen, a scalable data generation pipeline to generate diverse, high-quality scenarios using natural language prompts, generative models, and rule-based filtering. Experimental results show that our approach improves planning performance in collision-prone scenarios by 56\% over previous state-of-the-art planners while maintaining effectiveness in regular driving situations.

The primary challenge in becoming a fully reliable alternative lies in robust depth prediction capabilities, as camera-based systems struggle with long detection ranges and adverse lighting and weather conditions. In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion architecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of dense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid fusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar features in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association Transformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to produce more robust and accurate depth predictions. In the BEV, we refine the initial sparse representation by a Radar-weighted Depth Consistency. HyDRa achieves a new state-of-the-art for camera-radar fusion of 64.2 NDS (+1.8) and 58.4 AMOTA (+1.5) on the public nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our new semantically rich and spatially accurate BEV features can be directly converted into a powerful occupancy representation, beating all previous camera-based methods on the Occ3D benchmark by an impressive 3.7 mIoU.

Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed.

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps.

Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan.

With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics.

We propose a novel, one-step framework that we refer to as Car-STAGE, based on CARLA simulator, to generate data using a graphical user interface (GUI) defining configuration parameters to data collection without any user intervention. This framework can utilize the user-defined configuration parameters such as choice of maps, number and configurations of sensors, environmental and lighting conditions etc. to run the simulation in the background, collecting high-dimensional sensor data from diverse sensors such as RGB Camera, LiDAR, Radar, Depth Camera, IMU Sensor, GNSS Sensor, Semantic Segmentation Camera, Instance Segmentation Camera, and Optical Flow Camera along with the ground-truths of the individual actors and storing the sensor data as well as ground-truth labels in a local or cloud-based database. The framework uses multiple threads where a main thread runs the server, a worker thread deals with queue and frame number and the rest of the threads processes the sensor data. The other way we derive speed up over the native implementation is by memory mapping the raw binary data into the disk and then converting the data into known formats at the end of data collection. We show that using these techniques, we gain a significant speed up over frames, under an increasing set of sensors and over the number of spawned objects.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines.

Therefore, we propose a novel approach integrating Federated Learning (FL) into FF control to address these challenges. This approach enables privacy-preserving, communication-efficient, and decentralized continuous improvement of FF controllers across multiple agents without sharing personal or proprietary data. By leveraging FL, each agent learns a local, neural FF controller using its data and contributes only model updates to a global aggregation process, ensuring data privacy and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an autonomous driving use case. Therein, vehicles equipped with a trajectory-tracking feedback controller are enhanced by FL-based neural FF control. Simulations highlight significant improvements in tracking performance compared to pure FB control, analogous to model-based FF control. We achieve comparable tracking performance without exchanging private vehicle-specific data compared to a centralized neural FF control. Our results underscore the potential of FL-based neural FF control to enable privacy-preserving learning in multi-agent control systems, paving the way for scalable and efficient autonomous systems applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite the outstanding performance of CV systems in specific domains, their development and exploitation at industrial-scale necessitates, among other, the addressing of requirements related to the reliability, transparency, trustworthiness, security, safety, and robustness of the developed AI models. The latter raises the imperative need for the development of efficient, comprehensive and widely-adopted industrial standards. In this context, this study investigates the current state of play regarding the development of industrial computer vision AI standards, emphasizing on critical aspects, like model interpretability, data quality, and regulatory compliance. In particular, a systematic analysis of launched and currently developing CV standards, proposed by the main international standardization bodies (e.g. ISO/IEC, IEEE, DIN, etc.) is performed.

| **[Human-aligned Safe Reinforcement Learning for Highway On-Ramp Merging in Dense Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02624v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for the decision-making of autonomous driving consider safety as a reward instead of a cost, which makes it hard to balance the tradeoff between safety and other objectives. Human risk preference has also rarely been incorporated, and the trained policy might be either conservative or aggressive for users. To this end, this study proposes a human-aligned safe RL approach for autonomous merging, in which the high-level decision problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) that incorporates users' risk preference into the safety constraints, followed by a model predictive control (MPC)-based low-level control. The safety level of RL policy can be adjusted by computing cost limits of CMDP's constraints based on risk preferences and traffic density using a fuzzy control method. To filter out unsafe or invalid actions, we design an action shielding mechanism that pre-executes RL actions using an MPC method and performs collision checks with surrounding agents. We also provide theoretical proof to validate the effectiveness of the shielding mechanism in enhancing RL's safety and sample efficiency. Simulation experiments in multiple levels of traffic densities show that our method can significantly reduce safety violations without sacrificing traffic efficiency. Furthermore, due to the use of risk preference-aware constraints in CMDP and action shielding, we can not only adjust the safety level of the final policy but also reduce safety violations during the training stage, proving a promising solution for online learning in real-world environments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures | None |

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

| **[Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Continual Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05650v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning (CL) aims to learn new data while remembering previously acquired knowledge. In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PlanScope: Learning to Plan Within Decision Scope Does Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00476v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of autonomous driving, learning-based methods have been promising for the development of planning modules. During the training process of planning modules, directly minimizing the discrepancy between expert-driving logs and planning output is widely deployed. In general, driving logs consist of suddenly appearing obstacles or swiftly changing traffic signals, which typically necessitate swift and nuanced adjustments in driving maneuvers. Concurrently, future trajectories of the vehicles exhibit their long-term decisions, such as adhering to a reference lane or circumventing stationary obstacles. Due to the unpredictable influence of future events in driving logs, reasoning bias could be naturally introduced to learning based planning modules, which leads to a possible degradation of driving performance. To address this issue, we identify the decisions and their corresponding time horizons, and characterize a so-called decision scope by retaining decisions within derivable horizons only, to mitigate the effect of irrational behaviors caused by unpredictable events. Several viable implementations have been proposed, among which batch normalization along the temporal dimension is particularly effective and achieves superior performance. It consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of driving scores, as demonstrated through closed-loop evaluations on the nuPlan dataset. Essentially, this approach accommodates an appealing plug-and-play feature to enhance the closed-loop performance of other learning-based planning models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Human Insights Driven Latent Space for Different Driving Perspectives: A Unified Encoder for Efficient Multi-Task Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10095v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems require a comprehensive understanding of the environment, achieved by extracting visual features essential for perception, planning, and control. However, models trained solely on single-task objectives or generic datasets often lack the contextual information needed for robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified encoder trained on multiple computer vision tasks crucial for urban driving, including depth, pose, and 3D scene flow estimation, as well as semantic, instance, panoptic, and motion segmentation. By integrating these diverse visual cues-similar to human perceptual mechanisms-the encoder captures rich features that enhance navigation-related predictions. We evaluate the model on steering estimation as a downstream task, leveraging its dense latent space. To ensure efficient multi-task learning, we introduce a multi-scale feature network for pose estimation and apply knowledge distillation from a multi-backbone teacher model. Our findings highlight two key findings: (1) the unified encoder achieves competitive performance across all visual perception tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities; and (2) for steering estimation, the frozen unified encoder-leveraging dense latent representations-outperforms both its fine-tuned counterpart and the same frozen model pretrained on generic datasets like ImageNet. These results underline the significance of task-specific visual features and demonstrate the promise of multi-task learning in advancing autonomous driving systems.

| **[PIDLoc: Cross-View Pose Optimization Network Inspired by PID Controllers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02388v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate localization is essential for autonomous driving, but GNSS-based methods struggle in challenging environments such as urban canyons. Cross-view pose optimization offers an effective solution by directly estimating vehicle pose using satellite-view images. However, existing methods primarily rely on cross-view features at a given pose, neglecting fine-grained contexts for precision and global contexts for robustness against large initial pose errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose PIDLoc, a novel cross-view pose optimization approach inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Using RGB images and LiDAR, the PIDLoc comprises the PID branches to model cross-view feature relationships and the spatially aware pose estimator (SPE) to estimate the pose from these relationships. The PID branches leverage feature differences for local context (P), aggregated feature differences for global context (I), and gradients of feature differences for precise pose adjustment (D) to enhance localization accuracy under large initial pose errors. Integrated with the PID branches, the SPE captures spatial relationships within the PID-branch features for consistent localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIDLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-view pose estimation for the KITTI dataset, reducing position error by $37.8\%$ compared with the previous state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR-25 | None |
| **[Text2Scenario: Text-Driven Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving Test](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02911v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving (AD) testing constitutes a critical methodology for assessing performance benchmarks prior to product deployment. The creation of segmented scenarios within a simulated environment is acknowledged as a robust and effective strategy; however, the process of tailoring these scenarios often necessitates laborious and time-consuming manual efforts, thereby hindering the development and implementation of AD technologies. In response to this challenge, we introduce Text2Scenario, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to autonomously generate simulation test scenarios that closely align with user specifications, derived from their natural language inputs. Specifically, an LLM, equipped with a meticulously engineered input prompt scheme functions as a text parser for test scenario descriptions, extracting from a hierarchically organized scenario repository the components that most accurately reflect the user's preferences. Subsequently, by exploiting the precedence of scenario components, the process involves sequentially matching and linking scenario representations within a Domain Specific Language corpus, ultimately fabricating executable test scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that such prompt engineering can meticulously extract the nuanced details of scenario elements embedded within various descriptive formats, with the majority of generated scenarios aligning closely with the user's initial expectations, allowing for the efficient and precise evaluation of diverse AD stacks void of the labor-intensive need for manual scenario configuration.

Although recent data-driven approaches advance realistic behavior generation, their learning still relies primarily on a single real-world dataset, which limits their diversity and thereby hinders downstream algorithm optimization. In this paper, we propose DriveGen, a novel traffic simulation framework with large models for more diverse traffic generation that supports further customized designs. DriveGen consists of two internal stages: the initialization stage uses large language model and retrieval technique to generate map and vehicle assets; the rollout stage outputs trajectories with selected waypoint goals from visual language model and a specific designed diffusion planner. Through this two-staged process, DriveGen fully utilizes large models' high-level cognition and reasoning of driving behavior, obtaining greater diversity beyond datasets while maintaining high realism. To support effective downstream optimization, we additionally develop DriveGen-CS, an automatic corner case generation pipeline that uses failures of the driving algorithm as additional prompt knowledge for large models without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that our generated scenarios and corner cases have a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Downstream experiments further verify that the synthesized traffic of DriveGen provides better optimization of the performance of typical driving algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, despite the perception stability in harsh environments, the point cloud generated by mmWave radar is relatively sparse while containing significant noise, which limits its further development. Traditional mmWave radar enhancement approaches often struggle to leverage the effectiveness of diffusion models in super-resolution, largely due to the unnatural range-azimuth heatmap (RAH) or bird's eye view (BEV) representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that pioneers the application of fusing range images with image diffusion models, achieving accurate and dense mmWave radar point clouds that are similar to LiDAR. Benefitting from the projection that aligns with human observation, the range image representation of mmWave radar is close to natural images, allowing the knowledge from pre-trained image diffusion models to be effectively transferred, significantly improving the overall performance. Extensive evaluations on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets demonstrate that our approach provides substantial improvements, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in generating truly three-dimensional LiDAR-like point clouds via mmWave radar.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to 2025 IROS.

Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been explored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout choice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on multi-channel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this limitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed specifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments. ECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation Model (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring both robust generalizability and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional adaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank adaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the nested Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer layer of the underlying FM is treated as a separate expert, with embeddings extracted from these experts fused using trainable weights within a gating mechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local ECG features, leading to a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 7% increase in the F1 score, all while maintaining computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG-EmotionNet architecture is evaluated using a recently introduced and challenging driver emotion monitoring dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

CAPS addresses the challenge of imbalanced training datasets in imitation learning by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). The use of VQ-VAE provides a structured and interpretable data representation, which helps reveal meaningful patterns in the data. These patterns are used to group the data into clusters, with each sample being assigned a cluster ID. The cluster IDs are then used to re-balance the dataset, ensuring that rare yet valuable samples receive higher priority during training. By ensuring a more diverse and informative training set, CAPS improves the generalization of the trained planner across a wide range of driving scenarios. We evaluate our method through closed-loop simulations in the CARLA environment. The results on Bench2Drive scenarios demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, leading to notable improvements in model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, with the emergence of new applications, traditional communication technologies face the problems of scarce spectrum resources and high latency. Semantic communication, which focuses on extracting, transmitting, and recovering some useful semantic information from messages, can reduce redundant data transmission, improve spectrum utilization, and provide innovative solutions to communication challenges in the IoV. This paper systematically reviews state of art of semantic communications in the IoV, elaborates the technical background of IoV and semantic communications, and deeply discusses key technologies of semantic communications in IoV, including semantic information extraction, semantic communication architecture, resource allocation and management, and so on. Through specific case studies, it demonstrates that semantic communications can be effectively employed in the scenarios of traffic environment perception and understanding, intelligent driving decision support, IoV service optimization, and intelligent traffic management. Additionally, it analyzes the current challenges and future research directions. This survey reveals that semantic communications has broad application prospects in IoV, but it is necessary to solve the real existing problems by combining advanced technologies to promote its wide application in IoV and contributing to the development of intelligent transportation system.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to Entropy</p></details> | None |

However, existing path planning methodologies fall short of addressing this need due to their incapability to handle the diverse and complex parking scenarios in reality. While non-learning methods provide reliable planning results, they are vulnerable to intricate occasions, whereas learning-based ones are good at exploration but unstable in converging to feasible solutions. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we introduce Hybrid pOlicy Path plannEr (HOPE). This novel solution integrates a reinforcement learning agent with Reeds-Shepp curves, enabling effective planning across diverse scenarios. HOPE guides the exploration of the reinforcement learning agent by applying an action mask mechanism and employs a transformer to integrate the perceived environmental information with the mask. To facilitate the training and evaluation of the proposed planner, we propose a criterion for categorizing the difficulty level of parking scenarios based on space and obstacle distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms typical rule-based algorithms and traditional reinforcement learning methods, showing higher planning success rates and generalization across various scenarios.

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception.

Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, which necessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the high computational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered the seamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost of our approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%.
