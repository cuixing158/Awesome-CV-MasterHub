However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers. Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Beyond Overall Accuracy: Pose- and Occlusion-driven Fairness Analysis in Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26166v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern. In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN) alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[Multi-View Projection for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in 3D Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15545v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic segmentation is essential for autonomous driving and road infrastructure analysis, but state-of-the-art 3D models suffer from severe domain shift when applied across datasets. We propose a multi-view projection framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our method aligns LiDAR scans into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to generate large-scale synthetic 2D datasets (PC2D) in various modalities. An ensemble of 2D segmentation models is trained on these modalities, and during inference, hundreds of views per scene are processed, with logits back-projected to 3D using an occlusion-aware voting scheme to produce point-wise labels. These labels can be used directly or to fine-tune a 3D segmentation model in the target domain. We evaluate our approach in both Real-to-Real and Simulation-to-Real UDA, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Real-to-Real setting. Furthermore, we show that our framework enables segmentation of rare classes, leveraging only 2D annotations for those classes while relying on 3D annotations for others in the source domain.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TPAMI 2025; 17 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables; Project Page at https://ldkong.com/LargeAD</p></details> | None |
| **[NuRisk: A Visual Question Answering Dataset for Agent-Level Risk Assessment in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25944v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context. Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View (BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[Preemptive Spatiotemporal Trajectory Adjustment for Heterogeneous Vehicles in Highway Merging Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25929v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MuSLR: Multimodal Symbolic Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25851v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR) |
| **[Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Diverse Behavioral Traffic: A Heterogeneous Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25751v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Conformal Guidance for Learning under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16736v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning systems. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a broadly applicable solution for learning under uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Online Mapping for Autonomous Driving: Addressing Sensor Generalization and Dynamic Map Updates in Campus Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25542v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments. To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data, our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates, demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics</p></details> | None |
| **[ReCogDrive: A Reinforced Cognitive Framework for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08052v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have explored leveraging the world knowledge and cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address the long-tail problem in end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing methods typically formulate trajectory planning as a language modeling task, where physical actions are output in the language space, potentially leading to issues such as format-violating outputs, infeasible actions, and slow inference speeds. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, a novel Reinforced Cognitive framework for end-to-end autonomous Driving, unifying driving understanding and planning by integrating an autoregressive model with a diffusion planner. First, to instill human driving cognition into the VLM, we introduce a hierarchical data pipeline that mimics the sequential cognitive process of human drivers through three stages: generation, refinement, and quality control. Building on this cognitive foundation, we then address the language-action mismatch by injecting the VLM's learned driving priors into a diffusion planner to efficiently generate continuous and stable trajectories. Furthermore, to enhance driving safety and reduce collisions, we introduce a Diffusion Group Relative Policy Optimization (DiffGRPO) stage, reinforcing the planner for enhanced safety and comfort. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that ReCogDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, qualitative results across diverse driving scenarios and DriveBench highlight the model's scene comprehension. All code, model weights, and datasets will be made publicly available to facilitate subsequent research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Diffusion-Based mmWave Radar Point Cloud Enhancement Driven by Range Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02300v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has attracted significant attention in robotics and autonomous driving. However, despite the perception stability in harsh environments, the point cloud generated by mmWave radar is relatively sparse while containing significant noise, which limits its further development. Traditional mmWave radar enhancement approaches often struggle to leverage the effectiveness of diffusion models in super-resolution, largely due to the unnatural range-azimuth heatmap (RAH) or bird's eye view (BEV) representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that pioneers the application of fusing range images with image diffusion models, achieving accurate and dense mmWave radar point clouds that are similar to LiDAR. Benefitting from the projection that aligns with human observation, the range image representation of mmWave radar is close to natural images, allowing the knowledge from pre-trained image diffusion models to be effectively transferred, significantly improving the overall performance. Extensive evaluations on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets demonstrate that our approach provides substantial improvements, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in generating truly three-dimensional LiDAR-like point clouds via mmWave radar. Code will be released after publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

| **[StreamForest: Efficient Online Video Understanding with Persistent Event Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24871v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[TACO-Net: Topological Signatures Triumph in 3D Object Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24802v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next, we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs, the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[S2S-Net: Addressing the Domain Gap of Heterogeneous Sensor Systems in LiDAR-Based Collective Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17399v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collective Perception (CP) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the limitations of individual perception in the context of autonomous driving. Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception; however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to address the Sensor2Sensor domain gap in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of state-of-the-art CP methods and S2S-Net is conducted on the SCOPE dataset. This study shows that, all evaluated state-of-the-art mehtods for collective perception highly suffer from the Sensor2Sensor domain gap, while S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high performance in unseen sensor domains and outperforms the evaluated state-of-the-art methods by up to 44 percentage points.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\% to 7.38\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[FuncPoison: Poisoning Function Library to Hijack Multi-agent Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24408v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on multi-agent architectures powered by large language models (LLMs), where specialized agents collaborate to perceive, reason, and plan. A key component of these systems is the shared function library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process sensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical role in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored vulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based attack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven multi-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how agents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions to select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command formats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with deceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as misinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other agents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two representative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its ability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific agents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms. Our results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple toolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving systems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning to Sample: Reinforcement Learning-Guided Sampling for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24313v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling-based motion planning is a well-established approach in autonomous driving, valued for its modularity and analytical tractability. In complex urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

| **[Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24273v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction. However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing data-driven simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they suffer from inherent limitations in interpretability and generalizability--issues of critical importance in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce Symbolic Imitation Learning (SIL), a novel framework that leverages Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive explainable and generalizable driving policies from synthetic datasets. We evaluate SIL on real-world HighD and NGSim datasets, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art neural imitation learning methods using metrics such as collision rate, lane change efficiency, and average speed.

| **[Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16420v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness.

Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> | None |

To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, which establishes an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline}, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and \textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate that AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by \textbf{53.91%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54%}, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities.

This survey systematically reviews four core research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception. Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models. Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Delta-Triplane Transformers as Occupancy World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07338v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occupancy World Models (OWMs) aim to predict future scenes via 3D voxelized representations of the environment to support intelligent motion planning. Existing approaches typically generate full future occupancy states from VAE-style latent encodings, which can be computationally expensive and redundant. We propose Delta-Triplane Transformers (DTT), a novel 4D OWM for autonomous driving, that introduces two key innovations: (1) a triplane based representation that encodes 3D occupancy more compactly than previous approaches, and (2) an incremental prediction strategy for OWM that models {\em changes} in occupancy rather than dealing with full states. The core insight is that changes in the compact 3D latent space are naturally sparser and easier to model, enabling higher accuracy with a lighter-weight architecture. Building on this representation, DTT extracts multi-scale motion features from historical data and iteratively predict future triplane deltas. These deltas are combined with past states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTT delivers a 1.44$\times$ speedup (26 FPS) over the state of the art, improves mean IoU to 30.85, and reduces the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.</p></details> |  | None |

Data-driven defenses such as jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding, while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100% with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications.

However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness throughout extended driving sequences.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on NavSim benchmark.

Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with significantly reduced computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior, known as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to deployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study comparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL), Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing. Using a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and LiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS architectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios involving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We systematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three dimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity. Our results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of real-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without compromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under which failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the underlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies. Our findings offer actionable insights into the respective strengths and limitations of each modality and outline a path toward more robust and transferable validation of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '25)</p></details> | None |

Traditional large-scale map construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions, outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods, resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen, for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1) representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data.

However, existing methods are often constrained by a passive perception paradigm, relying solely on text-based reasoning. This passivity restricts the model's capacity to actively seek crucial visual evidence when faced with uncertainty. To address this, we introduce DriveAgent-R1, the first autonomous driving agent capable of active perception for planning. In complex scenarios, DriveAgent-R1 proactively invokes tools to perform visual reasoning, firmly grounding its decisions in visual evidence, thereby enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid thinking framework, inspired by human driver cognitive patterns, allowing the agent to adaptively switch between efficient text-only reasoning and robust tool-augmented visual reasoning based on scene complexity. This capability is cultivated through a three-stage progressive training strategy, featuring a core Cascaded Reinforcement Learning (Cascaded RL) phase. Extensive experiments on the Drive-Internal dataset, which is rich in long-tail scenarios, and the public nuScenes dataset show that, with only 3B parameters, DriveAgent-R1 achieves competitive performance comparable to top closed model systems such as GPT-5 and to human driving proficiency while remaining deployment-friendly, offering a proven path toward building more intelligent autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations.

The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map, achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds. Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy of LiDAR odometry.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability.

However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by drivers of autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from drivers' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiAuto-DriveAction/drive-action</p></details> | None |

However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings.

While Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction, most existing approaches overlook the inherent spatial dependencies and semantic relationships among map elements, which constrains their accuracy and generalization capabilities. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that explicitly models both spatial relations and semantic priors to enhance online HD map construction. Specifically, we introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. RelMap is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

It focuses LiDAR scan generation on a key aspect of scenes, the objects, while also benefiting from advancements in 3D object generative methods. We introduce a novel diffusion-based model to produce LiDAR point clouds of dataset objects, including intensity, and with an extensive control of the generation via conditioning information.

To address these challenges, we propose PL-VIWO2, a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that integrates an IMU, wheel encoder, and camera (supporting both monocular and stereo) for long-term robust state estimation. The main contributions are: (i) a novel line feature processing framework that exploits the geometric relationship between 2D feature points and lines, enabling fast and robust line tracking and triangulation while ensuring real-time performance; (ii) an SE(2)-constrained SE(3) wheel pre-integration method that leverages the planar motion characteristics of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates; and (iii) an efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that filters out dynamic features by jointly using IMU and wheel measurements. Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo simulations and public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PL-VIWO2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[GVDepth: Zero-Shot Monocular Depth Estimation for Ground Vehicles based on Probabilistic Cue Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06080v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing metric monocular depth estimation presents a significant challenge due to its ill-posed nature, while the entanglement between camera parameters and depth amplifies issues further, hindering multi-dataset training and zero-shot accuracy. This challenge is particularly evident in autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics, where data is collected with fixed camera setups, limiting the geometric diversity. Yet, this context also presents an opportunity: the fixed relationship between the camera and the ground plane imposes additional perspective geometry constraints, enabling depth regression via vertical image positions of objects. However, this cue is highly susceptible to overfitting, thus we propose a novel canonical representation that maintains consistency across varied camera setups, effectively disentangling depth from specific parameters and enhancing generalization across datasets. We also propose a novel architecture that adaptively and probabilistically fuses depths estimated via object size and vertical image position cues. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on five autonomous driving datasets, achieving accurate metric depth estimation for varying resolutions, aspect ratios and camera setups. Notably, we achieve comparable accuracy to existing zero-shot methods, despite training on a single dataset with a single-camera setup.

Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head (i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories. Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models.

A critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive decision-making. MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits. This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously evaluate zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach. On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\% and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more reliable systems.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV2025 Workshop on Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI Systems</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion) |

In this context, shared control refers to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability</p></details> | IWACIII 2025 | None |

Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods.

However, existing methods are often constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator (SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving policies.

The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance metrics of 67.1 NDS and 63.1 AMOTA.

This capability, however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then, harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation, we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods rely on single-modal data sharing, limiting fusion performance, particularly in heterogeneous sensor settings involving both LiDAR and cameras across vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). To address this, we propose Radian Glue Attention (RG-Attn), a lightweight and generalizable cross-modal fusion module that unifies intra-agent and inter-agent fusion via transformation-based coordinate alignment and a unified sampling/inversion strategy. RG-Attn efficiently aligns features through a radian-based attention constraint, operating column-wise on geometrically consistent regions to reduce overhead and preserve spatial coherence, thereby enabling accurate and robust fusion. Building upon RG-Attn, we propose three cooperative architectures. The first, Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP), prioritizes communication efficiency but assumes all agents have LiDAR, optionally paired with cameras. The second, Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), offers maximal flexibility, supporting any sensor setup (e.g., LiDAR-only, camera-only, or both) and enabling strong cross-modal generalization for real-world deployment. The third, Pyramid-RG-Attn Fusion (PRGAF), aims for peak detection accuracy with the highest computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show our framework delivers state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high flexibility and efficiency.

Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation (EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intend to submit to RA-L</p></details> | None |

On the other hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents, regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, LiDAR's high cost continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).</p></details> |  | None |

While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we study a data augmentation strategy that leverages the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured by the AV's sensors, as additional demonstrations. We introduce a simple vehicle-selection sampling and filtering strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer dataset for training. We evaluate this idea with a representative learning-based planner on a large real-world dataset and demonstrate improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, the approach reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10 percent of the original dataset, the method matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset. Through ablations, we analyze selection criteria and show that naive random selection can degrade performance. Our findings highlight the value of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/lyra/</p></details> | None |

Traditional rule-based localization involves many standalone modules, which is theoretically fragile and requires costly hyperparameter tuning, therefore sacrificing the accuracy and generalization. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end visual localization system, RAVE, in which the surrounding images are associated with the HD map data to estimate pose. To ensure high-quality observations for localization, a low-rank flow-based prior fusion module (FLORA) is developed to incorporate misaligned map prior into the perceived BEV features. Pursuing a balance among efficiency, interpretability, and accuracy, a hierarchical localization module is proposed, which efficiently estimates poses through a decoupled BEV neural matching-based pose solver (DEMA) using rasterized HD map, and then refines the estimation through a Transformer-based pose regressor (POET) using vectorized HD map. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can perform robust and accurate localization under varying environmental conditions while running efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop</p></details> | None |

Real crash reports contain precisely the contrastive evidence needed, but they are hard to use: narratives are unstructured, third-person, and poorly grounded to sensor views. We address these challenges by normalizing crash narratives to ego-centric language and converting both logs and crashes into a unified scene-action representation suitable for retrieval. At decision time, our system adjudicates proposed actions by retrieving relevant precedents from this unified index; an agentic counterfactual extension proposes plausible alternatives, retrieves for each, and reasons across outcomes before deciding. On a nuScenes benchmark, precedent retrieval substantially improves calibration, with recall on contextually preferred actions rising from 24% to 53%. The counterfactual variant preserves these gains while sharpening decisions near risk.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

Built upon a multi-modal large language model foundation like Gemini, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR.

Nevertheless, its point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components: the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module. Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP. Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges such as scene understanding and effective prediction for decision-making continue to present substantial obstacles to its large-scale deployment. In this paper, we present PIE, a pioneering framework that integrates advanced perception, reasoning, and intention modeling to dynamically capture interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. It incorporates a bidirectional Mamba fusion that addresses data compression losses in multimodal fusion of camera and LiDAR inputs, alongside a novel reasoning-enhanced decoder integrating Mamba and Mixture-of-Experts to facilitate scene-compliant anchor selection and optimize adaptive trajectory inference. PIE adopts an action-motion interaction module to effectively utilize state predictions of surrounding agents to refine ego planning. The proposed framework is thoroughly validated on the NAVSIM benchmark. PIE, without using any ensemble and data augmentation techniques, achieves an 88.9 PDM score and 85.6 EPDM score, surpassing the performance of prior state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that PIE is capable of reliably generating feasible and high-quality ego trajectories.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing BEV approaches encounter significant challenges due to the large feature space, complicating efficient modeling and hindering effective integration of global attention mechanisms. We propose a novel modeling strategy, called InstanceBEV, that synergistically combines the strengths of both map-centric approaches and object-centric approaches. Our method effectively extracts instance-level features within the BEV features, facilitating the implementation of global attention modeling in a highly compressed feature space, thereby addressing the efficiency challenges inherent in map-centric global modeling. Furthermore, our approach enables effective multi-task learning without introducing additional module. We validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model through predicting occupancy, achieving 3D occupancy panoptic segmentation by combining instance information. Experimental results on the OCC3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate that InstanceBEV, utilizing only 8 frames, achieves a RayPQ of 15.3 and a RayIoU of 38.2. This surpasses SparseOcc's RayPQ by 9.3% and RayIoU by 10.7%, showcasing the effectiveness of multi-task synergy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spatial Envelope MPC: High Performance Driving without a Reference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18506v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel envelope based model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to enable autonomous vehicles to handle high performance driving across a wide range of scenarios without a predefined reference. In high performance autonomous driving, safe operation at the vehicle's dynamic limits requires a real time planning and control framework capable of accounting for key vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints when following a predefined reference trajectory is suboptimal or even infeasible. State of the art planning and control frameworks, however, are predominantly reference based, which limits their performance in such situations. To address this gap, this work first introduces a computationally efficient vehicle dynamics model tailored for optimization based control and a continuously differentiable mathematical formulation that accurately captures the entire drivable envelope. This novel model and formulation allow for the direct integration of dynamic feasibility and safety constraints into a unified planning and control framework, thereby removing the necessity for predefined references. The challenge of envelope planning, which refers to maximally approximating the safe drivable area, is tackled by combining reinforcement learning with optimization techniques. The framework is validated through both simulations and real world experiments, demonstrating its high performance across a variety of tasks, including racing, emergency collision avoidance and off road navigation. These results highlight the framework's scalability and broad applicability across a diverse set of scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, deploying LLM-driven planning in the physical world demands strict adherence to safety and regulatory constraints, which current models often violate due to hallucination or weak alignment. Traditional data-driven alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), require costly human labeling, while recent formal-feedback approaches still depend on resource-intensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose LAD-VF, a fine-tuning-free framework that leverages formal verification feedback for automated prompt engineering. By introducing a formal-verification-informed text loss integrated with LLM-AutoDiff, LAD-VF iteratively refines prompts rather than model parameters. This yields three key benefits: (i) scalable adaptation without fine-tuning; (ii) compatibility with modular LLM architectures; and (iii) interpretable refinement via auditable prompts. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that LAD-VF substantially enhances specification compliance, improving success rates from 60% to over 90%. Our method thus presents a scalable and interpretable pathway toward trustworthy, formally-verified LLM-driven control systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts.

However, mainstream methods trained via imitation learning suffer from critical safety limitations, as they fail to distinguish between trajectories that appear human-like but are potentially unsafe. Some recent approaches attempt to address this by regressing multiple rule-driven scores but decoupling supervision from policy optimization, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose DriveDPO, a Safety Direct Preference Optimization Policy Learning framework. First, we distill a unified policy distribution from human imitation similarity and rule-based safety scores for direct policy optimization. Further, we introduce an iterative Direct Preference Optimization stage formulated as trajectory-level preference alignment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that DriveDPO achieves a new state-of-the-art PDMS of 90.0. Furthermore, qualitative results across diverse challenging scenarios highlight DriveDPO's ability to produce safer and more reliable driving behaviors.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, this paper investigates the problem of communication resource allocation for collaborative perception and proposes RACooper, a novel RSU-assisted resource allocation framework that maximizes perception accuracy under constrained communication resources. RACooper leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning model to dynamically allocate communication resources while accounting for real-time sensing data and channel dynamics induced by vehicular mobility. By jointly optimizing spatial confidence metrics and channel state information, our approach ensures efficient feature transmission, enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative perception. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to conventional baseline algorithms, RACooper achieves significant improvements in perception accuracy, especially under bandwidth-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline.

However, current generation-then-evaluation frameworks typically construct multiple plausible trajectory hypotheses but ultimately adopt a single most likely outcome, leading to overconfident decisions and a lack of fallback strategies that are vital for safety in rare but critical scenarios. Moreover, the usual decoupling of prediction and planning modules could result in socially inconsistent or unrealistic joint trajectories, especially in highly interactive traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a contingency-aware diffusion planner (CoPlanner), a unified framework that jointly models multi-agent interactive trajectory generation and contingency-aware motion planning. Specifically, the pivot-conditioned diffusion mechanism anchors trajectory sampling on a validated, shared short-term segment to preserve temporal consistency, while stochastically generating diverse long-horizon branches that capture multimodal motion evolutions. In parallel, we design a contingency-aware multi-scenario scoring strategy that evaluates candidate ego trajectories across multiple plausible long-horizon evolution scenarios, balancing safety, progress, and comfort. This integrated design preserves feasible fallback options and enhances robustness under uncertainty, leading to more realistic interaction-aware planning. Extensive closed-loop experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that CoPlanner consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both Val14 and Test14 datasets, achieving significant improvements in safety and comfort under both reactive and non-reactive settings. Code and model will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods lack generalization and are limited to specific tasks such as image recovery. To address these issues, we propose Gated-Mechanism Mixture-of-Experts (GM-MoE), the first framework to introduce a mixture-of-experts network for low-light image enhancement. GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MoE achieves superior generalization with respect to 25 compared approaches, reaching state-of-the-art performance on PSNR on 5 benchmarks and SSIM on 4 benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a critical bottleneck lies in the manual engineering of reward functions and training curricula for complex and dynamic driving tasks, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose OGR (Orchestrate, Generate, Reflect), a novel automated driving policy learning framework that leverages vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent collaboration. Our framework capitalizes on advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding capabilities of VLMs to construct a hierarchical agent system. Specifically, a centralized orchestrator plans high-level training objectives, while a generation module employs a two-step analyze-then-generate process for efficient generation of reward-curriculum pairs. A reflection module then facilitates iterative optimization based on the online evaluation. Furthermore, a dedicated memory module endows the VLM agents with the capabilities of long-term memory. To enhance robustness and diversity of the generation process, we introduce a parallel generation scheme and a human-in-the-loop technique for augmentation of the reward observation space. Through efficient multi-agent cooperation and leveraging rich multimodal information, OGR enables the online evolution of reinforcement learning policies to acquire interaction-aware driving skills. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the superior performance, robust generalizability across distinct urban scenarios, and strong compatibility with various RL algorithms. Further real-world experiments highlight the practical viability and effectiveness of our framework. The source code will be available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |

Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel group-relative RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative formulation and employs a surrogate objective for stable optimization, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 | None |

With high operating speeds, dynamic environments, and head-to-head interactions, autonomous racing requires algorithms that diverge from those in classical autonomous driving. Training such algorithms is particularly challenging: the need for rapid decision-making at high speeds severely limits model capacity. To address this, we propose End2Race, a novel end-to-end imitation learning algorithm designed for head-to-head autonomous racing. End2Race leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture to capture continuous temporal dependencies, enabling both short-term responsiveness and long-term strategic planning. We also adopt a sigmoid-based normalization function that transforms raw LiDAR scans into spatial pressure tokens, facilitating effective model training and convergence. The algorithm is extremely efficient, achieving an inference time of less than 0.5 milliseconds on a consumer-class GPU. Experiments in the F1Tenth simulator demonstrate that End2Race achieves a 94.2% safety rate across 2,400 overtaking scenarios, each with an 8-second time limit, and successfully completes overtakes in 59.2% of cases. This surpasses previous methods and establishes ours as a leading solution for the F1Tenth racing testbed.

This work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA.

It provides control over various environmental parameters, enabling thorough evaluation. Development bounding boxes are commonly utilized tools in deep learning and play a crucial role in AD applications. The predominant method for data generation in the CARLA Simulator involves identifying and delineating objects of interest, such as vehicles, using bounding boxes. The operation in CARLA entails capturing the coordinates of all objects on the map, which are subsequently aligned with the sensor's coordinate system at the ego vehicle and then enclosed within bounding boxes relative to the ego vehicle's perspective. However, this primary approach encounters challenges associated with object detection and bounding box annotation, such as ghost boxes. Although these procedures are generally effective at detecting vehicles and other objects within their direct line of sight, they may also produce false positives by identifying objects that are obscured by obstructions. We have enhanced the primary approach with the objective of filtering out unwanted boxes. Performance analysis indicates that the improved approach has achieved high accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 12 figures,VEHITS Conference 2024</p></details> | None |

To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature.

In particular, the ability to understand road topology, a key requirement for safe navigation, has received relatively little attention. While some recent works have begun to explore VLMs in driving contexts, their performance on topology reasoning is far from satisfactory. In this work, we systematically evaluate VLMs' capabilities in road topology understanding. Specifically, multi-view images are projected into unified ground-plane coordinate system and fused into bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Based on these BEV lanes, we formulate four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks, which together capture essential components of spatial topology reasoning. Through extensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some temporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in vector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source VLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also find that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size, length of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[ADVEDM:Fine-grained Adversarial Attack against VLM-based Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16645v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their strong reasoning and planning capabilities, are widely used in embodied decision-making (EDM) tasks in embodied agents, such as autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. Recent research has increasingly explored adversarial attacks on VLMs to reveal their vulnerabilities. However, these attacks either rely on overly strong assumptions, requiring full knowledge of the victim VLM, which is impractical for attacking VLM-based agents, or exhibit limited effectiveness. The latter stems from disrupting most semantic information in the image, which leads to a misalignment between the perception and the task context defined by system prompts. This inconsistency interrupts the VLM's reasoning process, resulting in invalid outputs that fail to affect interactions in the physical world. To this end, we propose a fine-grained adversarial attack framework, ADVEDM, which modifies the VLM's perception of only a few key objects while preserving the semantics of the remaining regions. This attack effectively reduces conflicts with the task context, making VLMs output valid but incorrect decisions and affecting the actions of agents, thus posing a more substantial safety threat in the physical world. We design two variants of based on this framework, ADVEDM-R and ADVEDM-A, which respectively remove the semantics of a specific object from the image and add the semantics of a new object into the image. The experimental results in both general scenarios and EDM tasks demonstrate fine-grained control and excellent attack performance.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce SQS, a novel query-based splatting pre-training specifically designed to advance SPMs in autonomous driving. SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian representations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the reconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the pre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks via query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries with task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements of occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable performance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in occupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior state-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3 mIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | None |

Recent advances have explored utilizing 3D semantic Gaussians to model occupancy while reducing computational overhead, but they remain constrained by insufficient multi-view spatial interaction and limited multi-frame temporal consistency. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Gaussian Splatting (ST-GS) framework to enhance both spatial and temporal modeling in existing Gaussian-based pipelines. Specifically, we develop a guidance-informed spatial aggregation strategy within a dual-mode attention mechanism to strengthen spatial interaction in Gaussian representations. Furthermore, we introduce a geometry-aware temporal fusion scheme that effectively leverages historical context to improve temporal continuity in scene completion. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes occupancy prediction benchmark showcase that our proposed approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also delivers markedly better temporal consistency compared to existing Gaussian-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance.

Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment.

A single vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches, leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities. In experiments on $\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$ and $\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves driving safety by up to ${\it 20.7}\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions.

In contrast, scene graph models make use of annotated data such as masks and bounding boxes from autonomous-driving datasets to capture complex 3D spatial relationships, but their implicit volumetric node representations are challenging to edit view-consistently. We propose Neural Atlas Graphs (NAGs), a hybrid high-resolution scene representation, where every graph node is a view-dependent neural atlas, facilitating both 2D appearance editing and 3D ordering and positioning of scene elements. Fit at test-time, NAGs achieve state-of-the-art quantitative results on the Waymo Open Dataset - by 5 dB PSNR increase compared to existing methods - and make environmental editing possible in high resolution and visual quality - creating counterfactual driving scenarios with new backgrounds and edited vehicle appearance. We find that the method also generalizes beyond driving scenes and compares favorably - by more than 7 dB in PSNR - to recent matting and video editing baselines on the DAVIS video dataset with a diverse set of human and animal-centric scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization, yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of 3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera was always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but mechanical vibration, road bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As there is relatively limited research on the impact of calibration on fusion detection performance, multi-sensor detection methods with flexible calibration dependency have remained a key objective. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the sensitivity of the SOTA EPNet++ detection framework and prove that even slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. To address this vulnerability, we propose a re-calibration model to re-calibrate the misalignment in detection tasks. This model integrates LiDAR point cloud, camera image, and initial calibration matrix as inputs, generating re-calibrated bias through semantic segmentation guidance and a tailored loss function design. The re-calibration model can operate with existing detection algorithms, enhancing both robustness against calibration bias and overall object detection performance. Our approach establishes a foundational methodology for maintaining reliability in multi-modal perception systems under real-world calibration uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IST 2025.

It effectively performs early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy. The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory prediction in V2X scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 pages, IROS2025</p></details> | None |

These rare cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution, but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions. Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards.

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PAC Apprenticeship Learning with Bayesian Active Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03693v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their decision-making with human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at RLC 2025; published in RLJ 2025</p></details> | None |

To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  | None |

In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks. On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Numerous studies in this field have already achieved significant results, demonstrating high effectiveness in addressing traffic sign recognition tasks. However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, we introduce RaFD, a radar-based object detection framework that estimates inter-frame bird's-eye-view (BEV) flow and leverages the resulting geometric cues to enhance detection accuracy. Specifically, we design a supervised flow estimation auxiliary task that is jointly trained with the detection network. The estimated flow is further utilized to guide feature propagation from the previous frame to the current one. Our flow-guided, radar-only detector achieves achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RADIATE dataset, underscoring the importance of incorporating geometric information to effectively interpret radar signals, which are inherently ambiguous in semantics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, TRFC cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions, and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution by the first three authors</p></details> | None |

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

In this paper, a digital twin (DT)-based cooperative driving system with roadside unit (RSU)-centric architecture is proposed for enhancing safety and efficiency at unsignalized intersections. The system leverages comprehensive bird-eye-view (BEV) perception to eliminate blind spots and employs a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework combining offline pre-training with online fine-tuning. Specifically, driving policies are initially trained using conservative Q-learning (CQL) with behavior cloning (BC) on real datasets, then fine-tuned using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with self-attention mechanisms to handle dynamic multi-agent coordination. The RSU implements real-time commands via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields failure rates below 0.03\% coordinating up to three connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), significantly outperforming traditional methods. In addition, the system exhibits sub-linear computational scaling with inference times under 40 ms. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust generalization across diverse unsignalized intersection scenarios, indicating its practicality and readiness for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

In this sense, it hinders their effective deployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by providing attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the model to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the driver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E better aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for navigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality importance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach dynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that the complementary information from visual and textual modalities is effectively utilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our method facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving environments. We evaluate VLM-E2E on the nuScenes dataset and achieve significant improvements in perception, prediction, and planning over the baseline end-to-end model, showcasing the effectiveness of our attention-enhanced BEV representation in enabling more accurate and reliable autonomous driving tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation, whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly improving compression efficiency and processing performance.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

Current SD-map-based approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g., OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FlowDrive: Energy Flow Field for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14303v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning, autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft, rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3, surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality.

We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model. Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> | None |

Notably, a specialized parking dataset is constructed for parking scenarios, which include those without interference from the opposite vehicle (OV) and complex ones involving interactions with the OV. Based on this dataset, a goal-conditioned state encoder is pretrained to map the fused perception information into the latent space. Then, an offline RL policy is optimized with a conservative regularizer that penalizes out-of-distribution actions. Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator. Comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework with the highest success rate and robust generalization to out-of-distribution parking scenarios.

Indeed, while combining trajectory prediction models is not straightforward, this simple approach enhances performance by 10% over the best prediction model, especially in the long-tailed metrics.

Even though for full hyperspectral images the best-performing methods exploit spatial-spectral information, performing classification solely on spectral information has its own advantages, e.g. smaller model size and thus less data required for training. Moreover, spectral information is complementary to spatial information and improvements on either part can be used to improve spatial-spectral approaches in the future. Recently, 1D-Justo-LiuNet was proposed as a particularly efficient model with very few parameters, which currently defines the state of the art in spectral classification. However, we show that with limited training data the model performance deteriorates. Therefore, we investigate MiniROCKET and HDC-MiniROCKET for spectral classification to mitigate that problem. The model extracts well-engineered features without trainable parameters in the feature extraction part and is therefore less vulnerable to limited training data. We show that even though MiniROCKET has more parameters it outperforms 1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and is mostly on par with it in the general case</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE CASE 2025</p></details> | None |

However, recent efforts to integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes. Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points. Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline, demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UM-Depth : Uncertainty Masked Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13713v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular depth estimation has been increasingly adopted in robotics and autonomous driving for its ability to infer scene geometry from a single camera. In self-supervised monocular depth estimation frameworks, the network jointly generates and exploits depth and pose estimates during training, thereby eliminating the need for depth labels. However, these methods remain challenged by uncertainty in the input data, such as low-texture or dynamic regions, which can cause reduced depth accuracy. To address this, we introduce UM-Depth, a framework that combines motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement to enhance depth accuracy at dynamic object boundaries and in textureless regions. Specifically, we develop a teacherstudent training strategy that embeds uncertainty estimation into both the training pipeline and network architecture, thereby strengthening supervision where photometric signals are weak. Unlike prior motion-aware approaches that incur inference-time overhead and rely on additional labels or auxiliary networks for real-time generation, our method uses optical flow exclusively within the teacher network during training, which eliminating extra labeling demands and any runtime cost. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware refinement. Overall, UM-Depth achieves state-of-the-art results in both self-supervised depth and pose estimation on the KITTI datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it is non-trivial to extend the existing methods to fisheye cameras with severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences and unstable temporal dynamics, all of which significantly degrade BEV performance. To address these challenges, we propose FishBEV, a novel BEV segmentation framework specifically tailored for fisheye cameras. This framework introduces three complementary innovations, including a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale Extraction (DRME) backbone that learns robust features under distortion while preserving scale consistency, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention (U-SCA) mechanism that leverages uncertainty estimation for reliable cross-view alignment, a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention (D-TSA) module that adaptively balances near field details and far field context to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset demonstrate that FishBEV consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, regarding the performance evaluation of FishBEV on the surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

Existing depth datasets, such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. We present ROVR, a large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient depth dataset designed to capture the complexity of real-world driving. ROVR comprises 200K high-resolution frames across highway, rural, and urban scenarios, spanning day/night and adverse weather conditions. A lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures scalable collection, while sparse but statistically sufficient ground truth supports robust training. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art monocular depth models reveals severe cross-dataset generalization failures: models achieving near-ceiling accuracy on KITTI degrade drastically on ROVR, and even when trained on ROVR, current methods fall short of saturation. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by ROVR-scene diversity, dynamic environments, and sparse ground truth, establishing it as a demanding new platform for advancing depth estimation and building models with stronger real-world robustness. Extensive ablation studies provide a more intuitive understanding of our dataset across different scenarios, lighting conditions, and generalized ability.</p></details> |  | None |

The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal, since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.</p></details> | GCPR 2025 | None |

This work presents a novel framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain, high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations, and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extension of our CVPR 2023 paper, "Weakly Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving," accepted for publication in TPAMI</p></details> | None |

Recent self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a 4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale, generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations. Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AirBreath Sensing: Protecting Over-the-Air Distributed Sensing Against Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11267v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A distinctive function of sixth-generation (6G) networks is the integration of distributed sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) to enable intelligent perception of the physical world. This resultant platform, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to enable a broad spectrum of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, including remote surgery, autonomous driving, and holographic telepresence. Recently, the communication bottleneck confronting the implementation of an ISEA system is overcome by the development of over-the-air computing (AirComp) techniques, which facilitate simultaneous access through over-the-air data feature fusion. Despite its advantages, AirComp with uncoded transmission remains vulnerable to interference. To tackle this challenge, we propose AirBreath sensing, a spectrum-efficient framework that cascades feature compression and spread spectrum to mitigate interference without bandwidth expansion. This work reveals a fundamental tradeoff between these two operations under a fixed bandwidth constraint: increasing the compression ratio may reduce sensing accuracy but allows for more aggressive interference suppression via spread spectrum, and vice versa. This tradeoff is regulated by a key variable called breathing depth, defined as the feature subspace dimension that matches the processing gain in spread spectrum. To optimally control the breathing depth, we mathematically characterize and optimize this aforementioned tradeoff by designing a tractable surrogate for sensing accuracy, measured by classification discriminant gain (DG). Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that AirBreath sensing effectively mitigates interference in ISEA systems, and the proposed control algorithm achieves near-optimal performance as benchmarked with a brute-force search.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

Transferring its generative capabilities to modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems has also emerged as a promising direction. However, existing diffusion-based trajectory generative models often exhibit mode collapse where different random noises converge to similar trajectories after the denoising process.Therefore, state-of-the-art models often rely on anchored trajectories from pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or scene priors in the training set to mitigate collapse and enrich the diversity of generated trajectories, but such inductive bias are not available in real-world deployment, which can be challenged when generalizing to unseen scenarios. In this work, we investigate the possibility of effectively tackling the mode collapse challenge without the assumption of pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or pre-computed scene priors. Specifically, we propose TransDiffuser, an encoder-decoder based generative trajectory planning model, where the encoded scene information and motion states serve as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. Different from existing approaches, we exploit a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the denoising process to enrich the latent representation space which better guides the downstream generation. Without any predefined trajectory anchors or pre-computed scene priors, TransDiffuser achieves the PDMS of 94.85 on the closed-loop planning-oriented benchmark NAVSIM, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluation further showcases TransDiffuser generates more diverse and plausible trajectories which explore more drivable area.</p></details> | Under review | None |

One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Even this poses a serious security challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks), adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them, thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials, thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.</p></details> |  | None |

Among various tasks in ISAC, scatter sensing plays a crucial role in exploiting the full potential of ISAC and supporting applications such as autonomous driving and low-altitude economy. However, most existing methods rely on either waveform and hardware modifications or traditional signal processing schemes, leading to poor compatibility with current communication systems and limited sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CSIYOLO, a framework that performs scatter localization only using estimated CSI from a single base station-user equipment pair. This framework comprises two main components: anchor-based scatter parameter detection and CSI-based scatter localization. First, by formulating scatter parameter extraction as an image detection problem, we propose an anchor-based scatter parameter detection method inspired by You Only Look Once architectures. After that, a CSI-based localization algorithm is derived to determine scatter locations with extracted parameters. Moreover, to improve localization accuracy and implementation efficiency, we design an extendable network structure with task-oriented optimizations, enabling multi-scale anchor detection and better adaptation to CSI characteristics. A noise injection training strategy is further designed to enhance robustness against channel estimation errors. Since the proposed framework operates solely on estimated CSI without modifying waveforms or signal processing pipelines, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing communication systems as a plugin. Experiments show that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing methods in scatter localization accuracy with relatively low complexities under varying numbers of scatters and estimation errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables.

In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, closing the loop through AI-based feedback may pose significant risks on reliability of autonomous driving due to very limited understanding about the mechanism of AI-driven perception processes. To overcome it, this paper aims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of AI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability, robustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense. First, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes by looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental AI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov chains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of that, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of mean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the robustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a stochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level of an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the stochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient design procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex optimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results are applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive simulation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget.

Yet, existing probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially tightening bounds compared to SOTA.

Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics, particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.</p></details> |  | None |

At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing approaches depend on high-resolution images and complex networks to achieve top performance, hindering their deployment in practical scenarios. Moreover, current multi-sensor fusion approaches mainly focus on improving feature fusion while largely neglecting effective supervision strategies for those features. To address these issues, we propose DAOcc, a novel multi-modal occupancy prediction framework that leverages 3D object detection supervision to assist in achieving superior performance, while using a deployment-friendly image backbone and practical input resolution. In addition, we introduce a BEV View Range Extension strategy to mitigate performance degradation caused by lower image resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAOcc achieves new state-of-the-art results on both the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin using only a ResNet-50 backbone and 256*704 input resolution. With TensorRT optimization, DAOcc reaches 104.9 FPS while maintaining 54.2 mIoU on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.

While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SPHERE.

However, the field still lacks a practical platform that enables dynamic model updates, rapid validation, fair comparison, and intuitive performance assessment. To that end, we introduce LightEMMA, a Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. LightEMMA provides a unified, VLM-based autonomous driving framework without ad hoc customizations, enabling easy integration with evolving state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models. We construct twelve autonomous driving agents using various VLMs and evaluate their performance on the challenging nuScenes prediction task, comprehensively assessing computational metrics and providing critical insights. Illustrative examples show that, although VLMs exhibit strong scenario interpretation capabilities, their practical performance in autonomous driving tasks remains a concern. Additionally, increased model complexity and extended reasoning do not necessarily lead to better performance, emphasizing the need for further improvements and task-specific designs.

Recent methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios, while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet.

However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving.

Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged, providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which collect and process limited scene-aware contexts. In contrast, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors such as LiDAR provide rich depth and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Even better the emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar detects the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. The integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, thereby supporting more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, we propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar sensors. To optimally combine the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we design a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds both-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Moreover, we design a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge to the ego-vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets.

To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However, pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built maps.

Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, prevalent single-mode planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework featuring a Global Expert and a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, equipped with a Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router, GEMINUS achieves both adaptability and robustness across diverse scenarios.

Traditional local differential privacy methods, designed for scalars and matrices, are insufficient for tensors, as they fail to preserve essential relationships among tensor elements. We introduce TLDP, a novel LDP algorithm for Tensors, which employs a randomized response mechanism to perturb tensor components while maintaining structural integrity. To strike a better balance between utility and privacy, we incorporate a weight matrix that selectively protects sensitive regions. Both theoretical analysis and empirical findings from real-world datasets show that TLDP achieves superior utility while preserving privacy, making it a robust solution for high-dimensional tensor data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities: coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.</p></details> |  | None |

World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments.

However, methods based on reinforcement learning and imitation learning often suffer from high sample complexity, poor generalization, and low safety. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an efficient and generalized end-to-end autonomous driving system (EGADS) for complex and varied scenarios. The RL agent in our EGADS combines variational inference with normalizing flows, which are independent of distribution assumptions. This combination allows the agent to capture historical information relevant to driving in latent space effectively, thereby significantly reducing sample complexity. Additionally, we enhance safety by formulating robust safety constraints and improve generalization and performance by integrating RL with expert demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EGADS significantly reduces sample complexity, greatly improves safety performance, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities in complex urban scenarios.

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |

However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore, we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action consistency and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (under second-round review)</p></details> | None |

This survey fills that gap by systematically analysing around 100 peer-reviewed papers that train, test or validate RL policies inside the open-source CARLA simulator. We first categorize the literature by algorithmic family model-free, model-based, hierarchical, and hybrid and quantify their prevalence, highlighting that more than 80% of existing studies still rely on model-free methods such as DQN, PPO and SAC. Next, we explain the diverse state, action and reward formulations adopted across works, illustrating how choices of sensor modality (RGB, LiDAR, BEV, semantic maps, and carla kinematics states), control abstraction (discrete vs. continuous) and reward shaping are used across various literature. We also consolidate the evaluation landscape by listing the most common metrics (success rate, collision rate, lane deviation, driving score) and the towns, scenarios and traffic configurations used in CARLA benchmarks. Persistent challenges including sparse rewards, sim-to-real transfer, safety guarantees and limited behaviour diversity are distilled into a set of open research questions, and promising directions such as model-based RL, meta-learning and richer multi-agent simulations are outlined. By providing a unified taxonomy, quantitative statistics and a critical discussion of limitations, this review aims to serve both as a reference for newcomers and as a roadmap for advancing RL-based autonomous driving toward real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances, generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation benchmarks validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, project page: \url{https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/Torque-Aware-VLA.github.io/}</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/Torque-Aware-VLA.github.io) |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 28 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables; Project Page at https://lidarcrafter.github.io</p></details> | None |

While conventional bias mitigation typically requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias), CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection), we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%} on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility, fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without necessitating full retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICCV 2025 UnMe workshop</p></details> | None |

In contrast, autonomous vehicles lack these abilities, making it challenging to manage perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, especially under complex or unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Benchmarking results show that fine-tuned MLLMs achieve an 11.8\% improvement in close-ended VQA accuracy and a 12.0\% increase in open-ended VQA scores compared to baseline models, while maintaining real-time performance with a 0.59-second average inference time per image. We validate our approach through real-world case studies in Canada and China, where fine-tuned models correctly identify safety risks that challenge even experienced human drivers. This work represents the first application of domain-specific MLLM fine-tuning for SOTIF domain in autonomous driving.

| **[Attention and Risk-Aware Decision Framework for Safe Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07412v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However, existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO. The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images. Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TEGRA: A Flexible & Scalable NextGen Mobile Core](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07410v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support emerging mobile use cases (e.g., AR/VR, autonomous driving, and massive IoT), next-generation mobile cores for 5G and 6G are being re-architected as service-based architectures (SBAs) running on both private and public clouds. However, current performance optimization strategies for scaling these cores still revert to traditional NFV-based techniques, such as consolidating functions into rigid, monolithic deployments on dedicated servers. This raises a critical question: Is there an inherent tradeoff between flexibility and scalability in an SBA-based mobile core, where improving performance (and resiliency) inevitably comes at the cost of one or the other? To explore this question, we introduce resilient SBA microservices design patterns and state-management strategies, and propose TEGRA -- a high-performance, flexible, and scalable SBA-based mobile core. By leveraging the mobile core's unique position in the end-to-end internet ecosystem (i.e., at the last-mile edge), TEGRA optimizes performance without compromising adaptability. Our evaluation demonstrates that TEGRA achieves significantly lower latencies, processing requests 20x, 11x, and 1.75x faster than traditional SBA core implementations -- free5GC, Open5GS, and Aether, respectively -- all while matching the performance of state-of-the-art cores (e.g., CoreKube) while retaining flexibility. Furthermore, it reduces the complexity of deploying new features, requiring orders of magnitude fewer lines of code (LoCs) compared to existing cores.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</p></details> |  | None |

Current solutions fall into two categories: 1) CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2) learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Adaptive Evolution Factor Risk Ellipse Framework for Reliable and Safe Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06375v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort in interactive autonomous driving has become a critical challenge. Traditional model-based techniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly conservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based approaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit limited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk Potential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data demands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic traffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary Risk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk assessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data. We introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and lateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope. Additionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through sigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard (TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real time. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively address complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of surrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that our ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher average speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive solution suitable for complex interactive driving environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Laws of Motion Forecasting and Planning -- Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08228v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Asymmetry Vulnerability and Physical Attacks on Online Map Construction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06071v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-definition maps provide precise environmental information essential for prediction and planning in autonomous driving systems. Due to the high cost of labeling and maintenance, recent research has turned to online HD map construction using onboard sensor data, offering wider coverage and more timely updates for autonomous vehicles. However, the robustness of online map construction under adversarial conditions remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic vulnerability analysis of online map construction models, which reveals that these models exhibit an inherent bias toward predicting symmetric road structures. In asymmetric scenes like forks or merges, this bias often causes the model to mistakenly predict a straight boundary that mirrors the opposite side. We demonstrate that this vulnerability persists in the real-world and can be reliably triggered by obstruction or targeted interference. Leveraging this vulnerability, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework capable of manipulating online constructed maps. First, our method identifies vulnerable asymmetric scenes along the victim AV's potential route. Then, we optimize the location and pattern of camera-blinding attacks and adversarial patch attacks. Evaluations on a public AD dataset demonstrate that our attacks can degrade mapping accuracy by up to 9.9%, render up to 44% of targeted routes unreachable, and increase unsafe planned trajectory rates, colliding with real-world road boundaries, by up to 27%. These attacks are also validated on a real-world testbed vehicle. We further analyze root causes of the symmetry bias, attributing them to training data imbalance, model architecture, and map element representation. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first vulnerability assessment of online map construction models and introduces the first digital and physical attack against them.</p></details> | <details><summary>CCS'2...</summary><p>CCS'25 (a shorter version of this paper will appear in the conference proceeding)</p></details> | None |

However, existing open-source datasets lack systematic coverage of long-tail scenes, and lane-change maneuvers being emblematic, rendering such data exceedingly scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a data mining framework that exhaustively analyzes two widely used datasets, NGSIM and INTERACTION, to identify sequences marked by hazardous behavior, thereby replenishing these neglected scenarios. Using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) enhanced with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and enriched by vehicular-environment interaction analytics, our method iteratively refines and parameterizes newly generated trajectories. Distinguished by a rationally adversarial and sensitivity-aware perspective, the approach optimizes the creation of challenging scenes. Experiments show that, compared to unfiltered data and baseline models, our method produces behaviors that are simultaneously both adversarial and natural, judged by collision frequency, acceleration profiles, and lane-change dynamics, offering constructive insights to amplifying long-tailed lane-change instances in datasets and advancing decision-making training.</p></details> |  | None |

While these environments offer safe, scalable, and engaging settings for testing driving strategies, ensuring both realism and robust performance amid dynamic and diverse scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently, the integration of game-based techniques with advanced learning frameworks has enabled the development of adaptive decision-making models that effectively manage the complexities inherent in varied driving conditions. These models outperform traditional simulation methods, especially when addressing scenario-specific challenges, ranging from obstacle avoidance on highways and precise maneuvering during on-ramp merging to navigation in roundabouts, unsignalized intersections, and even the high-speed demands of autonomous racing. Despite numerous innovations in game-based interactive driving, a systematic review comparing these approaches across different scenarios is still missing. This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of game-based interactive driving methods by summarizing recent advancements and inherent roadway features in each scenario. Furthermore, the reviewed algorithms are critically assessed based on their adaptation of the standard game model and an analysis of their specific mechanisms to understand their impact on decision-making performance.

This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation stems from two key challenges: (1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs, OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks, offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Federated learning (FL) serves as a promising paradigm to enable autonomous vehicles to train models collaboratively with their onboard computing resources. However, existing vehicle selection schemes for FL all assume predetermined and location-independent vehicles' datasets, neglecting the fact that vehicles collect training data along their routes, thereby resulting in suboptimal vehicle selection. In this paper, we focus on the fundamental perception problem and propose Sense4FL, a vehicular crowdsensing-enhanced FL framework featuring \textit{trajectory-dependent} vehicular \textit{training data collection} to \rev{improve the object detection quality} in AD for a region. To this end, we first derive the convergence bound of FL by considering the impact of both vehicles' uncertain trajectories and uploading probabilities, from which we discover that minimizing the training loss is equivalent to minimizing a weighted sum of local and global earth mover's distance (EMD) between vehicles' collected data distribution and global data distribution. Based on this observation, we formulate the trajectory-dependent vehicle selection and data collection problem for FL in AD. Given that the problem is NP-hard, we develop an efficient algorithm to find the solution with an approximation guarantee. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in improving object detection performance compared with existing benchmarks.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures | None |
