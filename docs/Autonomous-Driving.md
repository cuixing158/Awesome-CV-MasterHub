| **[SMOL-MapSeg: Show Me One Label](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05501v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface. With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently, pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However, they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency -- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting, which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Physical Adversarial Camouflage through Gradient Calibration and Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05414v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors. Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2) updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles. Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need for more robust system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DistillDrive: End-to-End Multi-Mode Autonomous Driving Distillation by Isomorphic Hetero-Source Planning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05402v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development, exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model.

Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

| **[MetaOcc: Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Surround-View 4D Radar and Camera for 3D Occupancy Prediction with Dual Training Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15384v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust 3D occupancy prediction is essential for autonomous driving, particularly under adverse weather conditions where traditional vision-only systems struggle. While the fusion of surround-view 4D radar and cameras offers a promising low-cost solution, effectively extracting and integrating features from these heterogeneous sensors remains challenging. This paper introduces MetaOcc, a novel multi-modal framework for omnidirectional 3D occupancy prediction that leverages both multi-view 4D radar and images. To address the limitations of directly applying LiDAR-oriented encoders to sparse radar data, we propose a Radar Height Self-Attention module that enhances vertical spatial reasoning and feature extraction. Additionally, a Hierarchical Multi-scale Multi-modal Fusion strategy is developed to perform adaptive local-global fusion across modalities and time, mitigating spatio-temporal misalignments and enriching fused feature representations. To reduce reliance on expensive point cloud annotations, we further propose a pseudo-label generation pipeline based on an open-set segmentor. This enables a semi-supervised strategy that achieves 90% of the fully supervised performance using only 50% of the ground truth labels, offering an effective trade-off between annotation cost and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaOcc under full supervision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by +0.47 SC IoU and +4.02 mIoU on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, and by +1.16 SC IoU and +1.24 mIoU on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset. These results demonstrate the scalability and robustness of MetaOcc across sensor domains and training conditions, paving the way for practical deployment in real-world autonomous systems.

| **[ArbiViewGen: Controllable Arbitrary Viewpoint Camera Data Generation for Autonomous Driving via Stable Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05236v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this, CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple vehicle configurations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs. Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and deployability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluation of Safety Cognition Capability in Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06497v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving systems is of paramount importance, yet existing research has largely focused on conventional benchmarks rather than safety-critical evaluation. In this work, we present SCD-Bench (Safety Cognition Driving Benchmark) a novel framework specifically designed to assess the safety cognition capabilities of VLMs within interactive driving scenarios. To address the scalability challenge of data annotation, we introduce ADA (Autonomous Driving Annotation), a semi-automated labeling system, further refined through expert review by professionals with domain-specific knowledge in autonomous driving. To facilitate scalable and consistent evaluation, we also propose an automated assessment pipeline leveraging large language models, which demonstrates over 98% agreement with human expert judgments. In addressing the broader challenge of aligning VLMs with safety cognition in driving environments, we construct SCD-Training, the first large-scale dataset tailored for this task, comprising 324.35K high-quality samples. Through extensive experiments, we show that models trained on SCD-Training exhibit marked improvements not only on SCD-Bench, but also on general and domain-specific benchmarks, offering a new perspective on enhancing safety-aware interactions in vision-language systems for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AdvDINO: Domain-Adversarial Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Spatial Proteomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04955v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Occupancy Learning with Spatiotemporal Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04705v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However, it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal inconsistency by 29%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV2025.

| **[BEVCon: Advancing Bird's Eye View Perception with Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04702v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to conventional task-specific optimizations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RoboTron-Sim: Improving Real-World Driving via Simulated Hard-Case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04642v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios (HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder (I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios. Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk driving scenarios.

| **[RoboTron-Drive: All-in-One Large Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07689v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension and interpretation capabilities in Autonomous Driving (AD) by incorporating large language models. Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks, neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge these gaps, we propose RoboTron-Drive, a general large multimodal model designed to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD datasets to finetune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on three unseen datasets, where RoboTron-Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. We hope RoboTron-Drive as a promising solution for AD in the real world.

| **[DSOcc: Leveraging Depth Awareness and Semantic Aid to Boost Camera-Based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20951v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated by non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make voxels aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Instead of enhancing feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OccLE: Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20617v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an intuitive and efficient scene understanding and has attracted significant interest in autonomous driving perception. Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves competitive performance with only 10\% of voxel annotations on the SemanticKITTI and Occ3D-nuScenes datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Segment Any Vehicle: Semantic and Visual Context Driven SAM and A Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04260v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance.

| **[DRIVE: Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified Evaluation for Constraint-Aware Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04066v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work, we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts. These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification. We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD, highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves 0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly, resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions, enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks. Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation.

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at RLC 2025</p></details> | None |

While recent diffusion-based models achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Veila: Panoramic LiDAR Generation from a Monocular RGB Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03690v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially, complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion; and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency, while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Prior2Former -- Evidential Modeling of Mask Transformers for Assumption-Free Open-World Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04841v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In panoptic segmentation, individual instances must be separated within semantic classes. As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, P2F demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across the board.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Scaling DRL for Decision Making: A Survey on Data, Network, and Training Budget Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03194v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network, and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions, ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot control, autonomous driving and LLM training.</p></details> |  | None |

With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging AI to enhance positioning accuracy and robustness has emerged as a field full of potential. Driven by the requirements and functionalities defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, AI/machine learning (ML)-based cellular positioning is becoming a key technology to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven cellular positioning. We begin by reviewing the fundamentals of wireless positioning and AI models, analyzing their respective challenges and synergies. We provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of 3GPP positioning standards, with a focus on the integration of AI/ML in current and upcoming standard releases. Guided by the 3GPP-defined taxonomy, we categorize and summarize state-of-the-art (SOTA) research into two major classes: AI/ML-assisted positioning and direct AI/ML-based positioning. The former includes line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection, time of arrival (TOA)/time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation, and angle prediction; the latter encompasses fingerprinting, knowledge-assisted learning, and channel charting. Furthermore, we review representative public datasets and conduct performance evaluations of AI-based positioning algorithms using these datasets. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven wireless positioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages.

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bigcileng.github.io/bilateral-driving ; Code: https://github.com/BigCiLeng/bilateral-driving</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/BigCiLeng/bilateral-driving) |

In contrast, autonomous vehicles lack these abilities, making it challenging to manage perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, especially under complex or unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Benchmarking results show that fine-tuned MLLMs achieve an 11.8\% improvement in close-ended VQA accuracy and a 12.0\% increase in open-ended VQA scores compared to baseline models, while maintaining real-time performance with a 0.59-second average inference time per image. We validate our approach through real-world case studies in Canada and China, where fine-tuned models correctly identify safety risks that challenge even experienced human drivers.

| **[Context-aware Risk Assessment and Its Application in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02919v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation, and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a 17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6 ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.</p></details> | ITSC 2025, 7 pages | None |
| **[OWLed: Outlier-weighed Layerwise Pruning for Efficient Autonomous Driving Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07711v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems offers promising enhancements in environmental understanding and decision-making. However, the substantial computational demands of deploying LLMs locally on vehicles render this approach unfeasible for real-world automotive applications. To address this challenge, we introduce OWLed, the Outlier-Weighed Layerwise Pruning for Efficient Autonomous Driving Framework that leverages outlier-weighted layerwise sparsity for model compression. Our method assigns non-uniform sparsity ratios to different layers based on the distribution of outlier features, significantly reducing the model size without the need for fine-tuning. To ensure the compressed model adapts well to autonomous driving tasks, we incorporate driving environment data into both the calibration and pruning processes. Our empirical studies reveal that the encoder component is more sensitive to pruning than the LLM, highlighting its critical role in the system. Experimental results demonstrate that OWLed outperforms existing methods in perception, action prediction, and language understanding while substantially lowering computational requirements. These findings underscore the potential of combining advanced pruning techniques with LLMs to develop efficient and robust autonomous driving systems capable of handling complex scenarios.

| **[MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives (TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position, speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Test-Time Model Adaptation for Quantized Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02180v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data. Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset.

| **[Beyond RGB and Events: Enhancing Object Detection under Adverse Lighting with Monocular Normal Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02127v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features, and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by 7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Traffic Scene Generation from Natural Language Description for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09575v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic and controllable traffic scenes from natural language can greatly enhance the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems. However, this task poses unique challenges: (1) grounding free-form text into spatially valid and semantically coherent layouts, (2) composing scenarios without predefined locations, and (3) planning multi-agent behaviors and selecting roads that respect agents' configurations. To address these, we propose a modular framework, TTSG, comprising prompt analysis, road retrieval, agent planning, and a novel plan-aware road ranking algorithm to solve these challenges. While large language models (LLMs) are used as general planners, our design integrates them into a tightly controlled pipeline that enforces structure, feasibility, and scene diversity. Notably, our ranking strategy ensures consistency between agent actions and road geometry, enabling scene generation without predefined routes or spawn points. The framework supports both routine and safety-critical scenarios, as well as multi-stage event composition. Experiments on SafeBench demonstrate that our method achieves the lowest average collision rate (3.5\%) across three critical scenarios. Moreover, driving captioning models trained on our generated scenes improve action reasoning by over 30 CIDEr points. These results underscore our proposed framework for flexible, interpretable, and safety-oriented simulation.</p></details> |  | None |

Widely used datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further, we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2 model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic matching in autonomous driving scenarios.

However, current performance evaluation protocols for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience, and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design, heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution. Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Evolving Scenario Generation Method based on Dual-modal Driver Model Trained by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02027v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures | None |

Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world models under these new metrics.</p></details> | Accepted ICRA 2025 | None |
| **[StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01875v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In online HD map generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition, extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance performance.

However, because of the time and computational costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components: Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently, during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch.

A primary bottleneck is the absence of large-scale real-world datasets that systematically capture driving preferences, severely limiting the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale real-world dataset explicitly curated for personalized E2EAD, integrating comprehensive scene topology with rich dynamic context derived from agent dynamics and semantics inferred via a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines behavioral analysis, rule-and-distribution-based heuristics, and subjective semantic modeling guided by VLM reasoning, with final refinement through human-in-the-loop verification. Building upon this dataset, we introduce the first standardized benchmark for systematically evaluating personalized E2EAD models. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art architectures demonstrate that incorporating personalized driving preferences significantly improves behavioral alignment with human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

A Mechanism Explanation Based on Game Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14539v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of external human-machine interface (EHMI) on autonomous vehicles (AVs) facilitates information exchange. Existing research fails to consider the impact of the sequence of actions, as well as the effects of EHMI applications and deception, raising the question of whether benevolent, well-intentioned deception should be permitted (i.e., misleading statements that are intended to benefit both parties). We established a game theory based EHMI information disclosure framework for AVs in this study. In considering benevolent deception, this framework divided the decision-making process into three stages, respectively encompassing three key questions: whether to disclose, when to disclose, and what type of intention information to disclose. The results show that theoretical advantages of deception exist in certain cases when AV expects to maximize the safety of the interaction. In 40 out of 484 cases (8.3%), safety can be enhanced through successful deception. Those successful deceptions fall into two categories: 1) In 28 of these cases, the straight-going AV expected the left-turning human-driven vehicle (HV) to yield, while HV exhibited lower speed and higher acceleration; 2) In 12 of these cases, AV expected HV to proceed first, while HV exhibited higher speed and lower acceleration. We also conducted a VR-based driving simulation experiment, and the results confirmed our conclusion. Additionally, we found that when participants had low trust in the EHMI, its use negatively impacted interaction efficiency instead. This study serves as an exploratory behavioral mechanism study based on specific hypotheses for future EHMI design and ethical decision-making of autonomous driving system.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adverse Weather-Independent Framework Towards Autonomous Driving Perception through Temporal Correlation and Unfolded Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01583v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition. Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.14737</p></details> | None |
| **[$I^{2}$-World: Intra-Inter Tokenization for Efficient Dynamic 4D Scene Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09144v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

| **[Equivariant Map and Agent Geometry for Autonomous Driving Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13922v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, deep learning enabled motion prediction is a popular topic. A critical gap in traditional motion prediction methodologies lies in ensuring equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations and maintaining invariant interaction relationships. This research introduces a groundbreaking solution by employing EqMotion, a theoretically geometric equivariant and interaction invariant motion prediction model for particles and humans, plus integrating agent-equivariant high-definition (HD) map features for context aware motion prediction in autonomous driving. The use of EqMotion as backbone marks a significant departure from existing methods by rigorously ensuring motion equivariance and interaction invariance. Equivariance here implies that an output motion must be equally transformed under the same Euclidean transformation as an input motion, while interaction invariance preserves the manner in which agents interact despite transformations. These properties make the network robust to arbitrary Euclidean transformations and contribute to more accurate prediction. In addition, we introduce an equivariant method to process the HD map to enrich the spatial understanding of the network while preserving the overall network equivariance property. By applying these technologies, our model is able to achieve high prediction accuracy while maintain a lightweight design and efficient data utilization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EqDrive: Efficient Equivariant Motion Forecasting with Multi-Modality for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17540v3)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting vehicular motions in autonomous driving requires a deep understanding of agent interactions and the preservation of motion equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations. Traditional models often lack the sophistication needed to handle the intricate dynamics inherent to autonomous vehicles and the interaction relationships among agents in the scene. As a result, these models have a lower model capacity, which then leads to higher prediction errors and lower training efficiency. In our research, we employ EqMotion, a leading equivariant particle, and human prediction model that also accounts for invariant agent interactions, for the task of multi-agent vehicle motion forecasting. In addition, we use a multi-modal prediction mechanism to account for multiple possible future paths in a probabilistic manner. By leveraging EqMotion, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with fewer parameters (1.2 million) and a significantly reduced training time (less than 2 hours).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, Accepted 2024 International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> | None |

However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance for SSC, surpassing most existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025), Hangzhou, China, Oct 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for scalable auto-labeling.

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-powered Agents.

(2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</p></details> | <details><summary>706 p...</summary><p>706 papers, 60 pages, 3 figures, 14 tables; GitHub: https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety) |

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding.

However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges, including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline. Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100% success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses.</p></details> |  | None |

This capability extends situational awareness beyond the limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning, and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference. Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality (VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 tables, 7 figures</p></details> | None |

Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at the Embedded Vision Workshop ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty. Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead.

However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis. Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes (e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to 80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100% prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to 38.66 seconds ahead.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, we present a novel framework for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism, spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency.

| **[TopoRec: Point Cloud Recognition Using Topological Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18725v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and localization. Extracting a meaningful global descriptor from a query point cloud that can be matched with the descriptors of the database point clouds is a challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we propose a novel methodology, named TopoRec, which utilizes Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for extracting local descriptors from a point cloud, thereby eliminating the need for resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. To test the quality of the proposed TopoRec technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford RobotCar, NCLT) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for large-scale place and object recognition, respectively. Unlike existing learning-based approaches such as PointNetVLAD and PCAN, our method does not require extensive training, making it easily adaptable to new environments. Despite this, it consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art learning-based and handcrafted baselines (e.g., M2DP, ScanContext) on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy and strong generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-level semantic understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations: Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI, and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter, facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving community.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

However, existing robotic middleware often struggles to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RIMAOS2C, a service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to tackle these challenges. By leveraging multi-level service discovery multicast, RIMAOS2C supports a wide variety of communication modes, including multiple cross-chip Ethernet protocols and PCIe communication capabilities. Its core mechanism, the Message Bridge, optimizes data flow forwarding and employs shared memory for centralized message distribution, reducing message redundancy and minimizing transmission delay uncertainty. Tested on L4 vehicles and Jetson Orin domain controllers, RIMAOS2C leverages TCP-based ZeroMQ to overcome the large-message transmission bottleneck in native CyberRT. In scenarios with two cross-chip subscribers, it eliminates message redundancy and improves large-data transmission efficiency by 36 to 40 percent while reducing callback latency variation by 42 to 906 percent. This research advances the communication capabilities of robotic operating systems and proposes a novel approach to optimizing communication in distributed computing architectures for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025, oral presentation</p></details> | None |

However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous driving systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we further formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of driving risks, including both collision risks and traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the reliability of evaluation depends on the diversity and realism of the generated scenes. Extreme weather conditions, particularly extreme rainfalls, are rare and costly to capture in real-world settings. While simulated environments can help address this limitation, existing rainy image synthesizers often suffer from poor controllability over illumination and limited realism, which significantly undermines the effectiveness of the model evaluation. To that end, we propose a learning-from-rendering rainy image synthesizer, which combines the benefits of the realism of rendering-based methods and the controllability of learning-based methods. To validate the effectiveness of our extreme rainy image synthesizer on semantic segmentation task, we require a continuous set of well-labeled extreme rainy images. By integrating the proposed synthesizer with the CARLA driving simulator, we develop CARLARain an extreme rainy street scene simulator which can obtain paired rainy-clean images and labels under complex illumination conditions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that CARLARain can effectively improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation models in extreme rainy scenes, with the models' accuracy (mIoU) improved by 5% - 8% on the synthetic dataset and significantly enhanced in real extreme rainy scenarios under complex illuminations. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kb824999404/CARLARain/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/kb824999404/CARLARain) |

However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views. To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%, 34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two main limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representations lack interaction with their frequency components in jointly modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the egocentric JRDB dataset, PatchTraj attains significant relative improvements of 26.7% in ADE and 17.4% in FDE, underscoring its substantial potential in embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many current methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

These challenges stem from fragmented architectures, limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion (cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning. The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures | None |

Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).</p></details> |  | None |

While indoor 3D VG has advanced, outdoor 3D VG remains underexplored due to two challenges: (1) large-scale outdoor LiDAR scenes are dominated by background points and contain limited foreground information, making cross-modal alignment and contextual understanding more difficult; and (2) most outdoor datasets lack spatial annotations for referential non-target objects, which hinders explicit learning of referential context. To this end, we propose LidaRefer, a context-aware 3D VG framework for outdoor scenes. LidaRefer incorporates an object-centric feature selection strategy to focus on semantically relevant visual features while reducing computational overhead. Then, its transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture excels at establishing fine-grained cross-modal alignment between refined visual features and word-level text features, and capturing comprehensive global context. Additionally, we present Discriminative-Supportive Collaborative localization (DiSCo), a novel supervision strategy that explicitly models spatial relationships between target, contextual, and ambiguous objects for accurate target identification. To enable this without manual labeling, we introduce a pseudo-labeling approach that retrieves 3D localization labels for referential non-target objects. LidaRefer achieves state-of-the-art performance on Talk2Car-3D dataset under various evaluation settings.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

In complex environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements. A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identify 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> | None |

However, most existing research still struggles to address the challenges posed by environments where multiple vehicles have to interact seamlessly. This study aims to integrate causal learning with reinforcement learning-based methods by leveraging causal disentanglement representation learning (CDRL) to identify and extract causal features that influence optimal decision-making in autonomous vehicles. These features are then incorporated into graph neural network-based reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. By using causal features as inputs, the proposed approach enables the optimization of vehicle behavior at an unsignalized intersection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest average reward during training and our approach significantly outperforms other learning-based methods in several key metrics such as collision rate and average cumulative reward during testing. This study provides a promising direction for advancing multi-agent autonomous driving systems and make autonomous vehicles' navigation safer and more efficient in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.</p></details> | 5 pages | None |

Synthetic data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation, maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A dis...</summary><p>A dissertation submitted to The University of Manchester for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |

VirT&R leverages aerial imagery captured for a target environment to train a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model so that dense point clouds and photo-textured meshes can be extracted. The NeRF mesh is used to create a high-fidelity simulation of the environment for piloting an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to virtually define a desired path. The mission can then be executed in the actual target environment by using NeRF-generated point cloud submaps associated along the path and an existing LiDAR Teach and Repeat (LT&R) framework. We benchmark the repeatability of VirT&R on over 12 km of autonomous driving data using physical markings that allow a sim-to-real lateral path-tracking error to be obtained and compared with LT&R. VirT&R achieved measured root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 19.5 cm and 18.4 cm in two different environments, which are slightly less than one tire width (24 cm) on the robot used for testing, and respective maximum errors were 39.4 cm and 47.6 cm. This was done using only the NeRF-derived teach map, demonstrating that VirT&R has similar closed-loop path-tracking performance to LT&R but does not require a human to manually teach the path to the UGV in the actual environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a vehicle, but exhaustively exploring the vast parameter space of possible scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE) methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple, distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case study .</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> | None |

While LiDAR and visual (RGB) sensors are commonly used, thermal imaging remains underrepresented in datasets, despite its acknowledged advantages for VRU detection in extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we present R-LiViT, the first dataset to combine LiDAR, RGB, and thermal imaging from a roadside perspective, with a strong focus on VRUs. R-LiViT captures three intersections during both day and night, ensuring a diverse dataset. It includes 10,000 LiDAR frames and 2,400 temporally and spatially aligned RGB and thermal images across 150 traffic scenarios, with 7 and 8 annotated classes respectively, providing a comprehensive resource for tasks such as object detection and tracking.

Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on head samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers. Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology (PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing its scalability for real-world applications.

We propose RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1) Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2) probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3) real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously.

A novel hierarchical game-based decision framework is developed for the ego vehicle. This framework features an interaction graph, which characterizes the interaction relationships between the ego and its surrounding traffic agents (including AVs, human driven vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles, and others), and enables the ego to smartly select a limited number of agents as its game players. Compared to the standard multi-player games, where all surrounding agents are considered as game players, the hierarchical game significantly reduces the computational complexity. In addition, compared to pairwise games, the most popular approach in the literature, the hierarchical game promises more efficient decisions for the ego (in terms of less unnecessary waiting and yielding). To further reduce the computational cost, we then propose an improved hierarchical game, which decomposes the hierarchical game into a set of sub-games. Decision safety and efficiency are analyzed in both hierarchical games. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, with an intersection-crossing scenario as a case study.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 20 figures, 1 algorithm</p></details> | None |

However, the long-tailed distribution of real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception models on underrepresented classes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving high-granularity surface reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering remains a challenge. Gaussian splatting offers efficient photorealistic rendering but struggles with geometric inconsistencies due to fragmented primitives and sparse observational data in robotics applications. Existing regularization methods, which rely on render-derived constraints, often fail in complex environments. Moreover, effectively integrating sparse LiDAR data with Gaussian splatting remains challenging. We propose a unified LiDAR-visual system that synergizes Gaussian splatting with a neural signed distance field. The accurate LiDAR point clouds enable a trained neural signed distance field to offer a manifold geometry field. This motivates us to offer an SDF-based Gaussian initialization for physically grounded primitive placement and a comprehensive geometric regularization for geometrically consistent rendering and reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality across diverse trajectories.

| **[SAMITE: Position Prompted SAM2 with Calibrated Memory for Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21732v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE.

However, integrating multi-source sensor data from both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ICCVW</p></details> | None |

Typically, in the probabilistic variant of such systems, a neural network first extracts a set of symbols from sub-symbolic input, which are then used by a symbolic component to reason in a probabilistic manner towards answering a query. In this work, we address the problem of formally verifying the robustness of such NeSy probabilistic reasoning systems, therefore paving the way for their safe deployment in critical domains. We analyze the complexity of solving this problem exactly, and show that a decision version of the core computation is $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathrm{PP}}$-complete. In the face of this result, we propose the first approach for approximate, relaxation-based verification of probabilistic NeSy systems. We demonstrate experimentally on a standard NeSy benchmark that the proposed method scales exponentially better than solver-based solutions and apply our technique to a real-world autonomous driving domain, where we verify a safety property under large input dimensionalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning</p></details> | None |

However, existing research has largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K) and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18 sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge, enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval. By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and methodology for advancing research in traffic safety.

However, 3DGS still faces major efficiency challenges when faced with high frame rate requirements and resource-constrained edge deployment. To enable efficient 3DGS, in this paper, we propose LS-Gaussian, an algorithm/hardware co-design framework for lightweight streaming 3D rendering. LS-Gaussian is motivated by the core observation that 3DGS suffers from substantial computation redundancy and stalls. On one hand, in practical scenarios, high-frame-rate 3DGS is often applied in settings where a camera observes and renders the same scene continuously but from slightly different viewpoints. Therefore, instead of rendering each frame separately, LS-Gaussian proposes a viewpoint transformation algorithm that leverages inter-frame continuity for efficient sparse rendering. On the other hand, as different tiles within an image are rendered in parallel but have imbalanced workloads, frequent hardware stalls also slow down the rendering process. LS-Gaussian predicts the workload for each tile based on viewpoint transformation to enable more balanced parallel computation and co-designs a customized 3DGS accelerator to support the workload-aware mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that LS-Gaussian achieves 5.41x speedup over the edge GPU baseline on average and up to 17.3x speedup with the customized accelerator, while incurring only minimal visual quality degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2025</p></details> | None |

Point-based neural rendering (PBNR) offers a photorealistic and efficient alternative to conventional methods, yet it is still challenging to achieve real-time rendering on mobile platforms. We pinpoint two major bottlenecks in PBNR pipelines: LoD search and splatting. LoD search suffers from workload imbalance and irregular memory access, making it inefficient on off-the-shelf GPUs. Meanwhile, splatting introduces severe warp divergence across GPU threads due to its inherent sparsity. To tackle these challenges, we propose SLTarch, an algorithm-architecture co-designed framework. At its core, SLTarch introduces SLTree, a dedicated subtree-based data structure, and LTcore, a specialized hardware architecture tailored for efficient LoD search. Additionally, we co-design a divergence-free splatting algorithm with our simple yet principled hardware augmentation, SPcore, to existing PBNR accelerators. Compared to a mobile GPU, SLTarch achieves 3.9$\times$ speedup and 98\% energy savings with negligible architecture overhead. Compared to existing accelerator designs, SLTarch achieves 1.8$\times$ speedup with 54\% energy savings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing datasets primarily focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV) videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with 2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments.

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often construct BEV representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set.

Existing methods inadequately utilize temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing real-time scheduling and response-time analysis techniques for ROS 2 focus on applications written in C++ and do not address the unique execution models and challenges presented by Rust's asynchronous programming paradigm. In this paper, we analyze the execution model of R2R -- an asynchronous Rust ROS 2 bindings and various asynchronous Rust runtimes, comparing them with the execution model of C++ ROS 2 applications. We propose a structured approach for R2R applications aimed at deterministic real-time operation involving thread prioritization and callback-to-thread mapping schemes. Our experimental evaluation based on measuring end-to-end latencies of a synthetic application shows that the proposed approach is effective and outperforms other evaluated configurations. A more complex autonomous driving case study demonstrates its practical applicability. Overall, the experimental results indicate that our proposed structure achieves bounded response times for time-critical tasks.

We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making. DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models, such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Ultra-Low-Latency Edge Inference for Distributed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13360v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a broad consensus that artificial intelligence (AI) will be a defining component of the sixth-generation (6G) networks. As a specific instance, AI-empowered sensing will gather and process environmental perception data at the network edge, giving rise to integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA). Many applications, such as autonomous driving and industrial manufacturing, are latency-sensitive and require end-to-end (E2E) performance guarantees under stringent deadlines. However, the 5G-style ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) techniques designed with communication reliability and agnostic to the data may fall short in achieving the optimal E2E performance of perceptive wireless systems. In this work, we introduce an ultra-low-latency (ultra-LoLa) inference framework for perceptive networks that facilitates the analysis of the E2E sensing accuracy in distributed sensing by jointly considering communication reliability and inference accuracy. By characterizing the tradeoff between packet length and the number of sensing observations, we derive an efficient optimization procedure that closely approximates the optimal tradeoff. We validate the accuracy of the proposed method through experimental results, and show that the proposed ultra-Lola inference framework outperforms conventional reliability-oriented protocols with respect to sensing performance under a latency constraint.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06743v3)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First and Second authors contributed equally; Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation; Winner of the best paper award</p></details> | None |
| **[Model-Structured Neural Networks to Control the Steering Dynamics of Autonomous Race Cars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20427v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous racing has gained increasing attention in recent years, as a safe environment to accelerate the development of motion planning and control methods for autonomous driving. Deep learning models, predominantly based on neural networks (NNs), have demonstrated significant potential in modeling the vehicle dynamics and in performing various tasks in autonomous driving. However, their black-box nature is critical in the context of autonomous racing, where safety and robustness demand a thorough understanding of the decision-making algorithms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes MS-NN-steer, a new Model-Structured Neural Network for vehicle steering control, integrating the prior knowledge of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics into the neural architecture. The proposed controller is validated using real-world data from the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) competition, with full-scale autonomous race cars. In comparison with general-purpose NNs, MS-NN-steer is shown to achieve better accuracy and generalization with small training datasets, while being less sensitive to the weights' initialization. Also, MS-NN-steer outperforms the steering controller used by the A2RL winning team. Our implementation is available open-source in a GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)</p></details> | None |
| **[VESPA: Towards un(Human)supervised Open-World Pointcloud Labeling for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20397v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

Understanding the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the process.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often rely on abstracted perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich, detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate (CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity, thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale, challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road conditions and dynamic elements.

It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity. To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.

| **[MambaMap: Online Vectorized HD Map Construction using State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20224v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically, MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges.

Vision-Language models Still Struggle With Spatial Understanding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20174v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks.

Traditional fusion methods, including early, intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality. Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease detection and neural decoding.</p></details> |  | None |

While imitation learning in discrete settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning. When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e., predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered in isolation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expos...</summary><p>Exposition and experiments have been deemed insufficient.

Our approach employs a two-stage optimization pipeline of dynamic street Gaussians. In the first stage, we extract 2D motion masks based on the observation that 3D Gaussian Splatting inherently can reconstruct only the static regions in dynamic environments. These extracted 2D motion priors are then mapped into the Gaussian space in a differentiable manner, leveraging an efficient formulation of dynamic Gaussians in the second stage. Combined with the introduced geometric regularizations, our method are able to address the over-fitting issues caused by data sparsity in autonomous driving, reconstructing physically plausible Gaussians that align with object surfaces rather than floating in air. Furthermore, we introduce temporal cross-view consistency to ensure coherence across time and viewpoints, resulting in high-quality surface reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of DeSiRe-GS, surpassing prior self-supervised arts and achieving accuracy comparable to methods relying on external 3D bounding box annotations.

Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication in future 6G networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> | None |

Real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unsafe, making large-scale validation impractical. In contrast, simulation environments offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative for rigorous verification and validation. A critical component of the validation process is scenario generation, which involves designing and configuring traffic scenarios to evaluate autonomous systems' responses to various events and uncertainties. However, existing scenario generation tools often require programming knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. To address this limitation, we present an interactive, no-code framework for scenario generation. Our framework features a graphical interface that enables users to create, modify, save, load, and execute scenarios without needing coding expertise or detailed simulation knowledge. Unlike script-based tools such as Scenic or ScenarioRunner, our approach lowers the barrier to entry and supports a broader user base. Central to our framework is a graph-based scenario representation that facilitates structured management, supports both manual and automated generation, and enables integration with deep learning-based scenario and behavior generation methods. In automated mode, the framework can randomly sample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions, allowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets. By simplifying the scenario generation process, this framework supports more efficient testing workflows and increases the accessibility of simulation-based validation for researchers, engineers, and policymakers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper is accepted in IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025)</p></details> | None |

Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes, BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model trained with simultaneous access to all client data.

Current approaches are trained to predict trajectories in an open-loop environment, which struggle with quick reactions to other agents in closed-loop environments and risk generating kinematically infeasible plans due to the gap between open-loop training and closed-loop driving. In this paper, we introduce Hydra-NeXt, a novel multi-branch planning framework that unifies trajectory prediction, control prediction, and a trajectory refinement network in one model. Unlike current open-loop trajectory prediction models that only handle general-case planning, Hydra-NeXt further utilizes a control decoder to focus on short-term actions, which enables faster responses to dynamic situations and reactive agents. Moreover, we propose the Trajectory Refinement module to augment and refine the planning decisions by effectively adhering to kinematic constraints in closed-loop environments. This unified approach bridges the gap between open-loop training and closed-loop driving, demonstrating superior performance of 65.89 Driving Score (DS) and 48.20% Success Rate (SR) on the Bench2Drive dataset without relying on external experts for data collection. Hydra-NeXt surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 22.98 DS and 17.49 SR, marking a significant advancement in autonomous driving.

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance.

Accurate extrinsic calibration between millimeter-wave radar and camera systems is critical for robust multimodal perception in robotics, yet remains challenging due to inherent sensor noise characteristics and complex error propagation. This paper presents a systematic calibration framework to address critical challenges through a spatial 3d uncertainty-aware PnP algorithm (3DUPnP) that explicitly models spherical coordinate noise propagation in radar measurements, then compensating for non-zero error expectations during coordinate transformations. Finally, experimental validation demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art CPnP baseline, including improved consistency in simulations and enhanced precision in physical experiments. This study provides a robust calibration solution for robotic systems equipped with millimeter-wave radar and cameras, tailored specifically for autonomous driving and robotic perception applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

Conventional approaches depend on supervised learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception module in intelligent transportation system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Internet of Things (AIBThings 2025)</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world urban environments.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Event-Based De-Snowing for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20901v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes, making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset, resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions, paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

These features are continuously updated via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms, resulting in a growing number of software versions and variants due to the diversity of vehicles, cloud/edge environments, and stakeholders involved. The lack of a unified integration environment further complicates development, as connected mobility solutions are often built in isolation. To ensure reliable operations across heterogeneous systems, a dynamic orchestration of functions that considers hardware and software variability is essential. This paper presents an open-source CI/CD pipeline tailored for SDVs. It automates the build, test, and deployment phases using a combination of containerized open-source tools, creating a standardized, portable, and scalable ecosystem accessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, a custom OTA middleware distributes software updates and supports rollbacks across vehicles and backend services. Update variants are derived based on deployment target dependencies and hardware configurations. The pipeline also supports continuous development and deployment of AI models for autonomous driving features. Its effectiveness is evaluated using an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario involving TurtleBots and a coordinating backend server. Two object detection variants are developed and deployed to match hardware-specific requirements. Results demonstrate seamless OTA updates, correct variant selection, and successful orchestration across all targets. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable and efficient solution for managing software variants and OTA updates in SDVs, contributing to the advancement of future mobility technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |

Due to the high reliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial to resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex cloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to diagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible since they would significantly delay the troubleshooting. To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible platform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The platform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial data collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag supports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime. Dependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting in a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are monitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of the graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis is performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely causes. To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment for connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be detected reliably. As such, the platform offers the potential to gain new insights and reduce downtime by identifying problems and their causes at an early stage.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

BEV-LLM leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images, incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art by up to 5\% in BLEU scores.

Yet, these models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision. Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent. InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet, but produces complex explanations. We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability of prototype-based explanations.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components: Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance. Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP and 32.8\% AMOTA.

VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions (hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly improved reconstruction quality. The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Most of the existing methods focus on any one particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3) a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

Reinforcement learning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to learn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies on rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current scenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a balance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which progressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising approach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies. However, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula, focusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics. This work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum learning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively generates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive mechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring exposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though exchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability, reflecting real-world perception constraints. Results demonstrate the teacher's ability to generate diverse traffic behaviors. The student, trained with automatic curricula, outperformed agents trained on rule-based traffic, achieving higher rewards and exhibiting balanced, assertive driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.

However, existing VOS models often struggle with precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i) leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and (iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including, coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets.

Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations. Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal navigable corridors in the image.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects (e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly, requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2) invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large language models in recent years.

| **[Delving into Mapping Uncertainty for Mapless Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18498v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches, where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data, reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight, self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

These attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes. Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification, primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics, limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.00540</p></details> | None |

While simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks, its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments. CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views, enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates challenging corner cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS ...</summary><p>IROS 2025, Code: https://github.com/SainingZhang/CRUISE</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SainingZhang/CRUISE) |

Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, published to ACL 2025</p></details> | None |

Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better generalization to unseen scenarios.

| **[Policy Disruption in Reinforcement Learning:Adversarial Attack with Large Language Models and Critical State Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18113v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Select2Drive: Pragmatic Communications for Real-Time Collaborative Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12040v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-everything communications-assisted autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with pragmatic communications (PragComm) emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time collaboration among vehicles and other agents. Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</p></details> |  | None |

As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents in the context of autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been withdrawn due to an internal institutional policy that prohibits preprint submissions to arXiv</p></details> | None |

Their remarkable performance in understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks (NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations. This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing two-stage methods suffer from inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads. To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD) maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element identification, and topology reasoning.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion) |

Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning.

Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, which necessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the high computational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered the seamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost of our approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%.

Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However, due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality. Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point cloud upsampling tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional retrieval-based methods for geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning. However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level (up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization systems.</p></details> |  | None |

State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of NeurIPS 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.05982</p></details> | None |

In this work, we address the challenge of low-quality generation of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction. To tackle this issue, we propose a two-stage multi-agent interactive prediction framework named \textit{keypoint-guided joint prediction after classification-aware marginal proposal} (JAM). The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction process, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to learn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information for the joint prediction module. The second stage is modeled as a joint prediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals from the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We explicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in better capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial predicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show that our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the framework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory prediction.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition, EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as an end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object detection tasks for AVs.

However, most existing approaches are single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of 3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/DzpLab/SDGOCC.</p></details> | accepted by CVPR2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/DzpLab/SDGOCC) |

This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance. Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal, and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> | None |

However, a critical question remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213% increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82% decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all standalone defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

However, obtaining clean and complete point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness, we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions. Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM) that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets.

Its accuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can have implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect different types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the data. To this end, we propose a target-based extrinsic calibration system tailored for a multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suite. This system enables cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using a custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method.

However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for autonomous driving scenarios.

As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems.

Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously.

However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

However, its computationally intensive nature poses significant challenges for resource-constrained autonomous driving hardware. This paper presents an end-to-end FPGA-based acceleration framework targeting the quadratic programming (QP), core of optimization-based path planning. We employ a hardware-friendly alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for QP solving and a parallelizable preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method for linear systems. By analyzing sparse matrix patterns, we propose customized storage schemes and efficient sparse matrix multiplication units, significantly reducing resource usage and accelerating matrix operations.

Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the 6G infrastructure brings redundancy to the network, ensuring continuity of communications even under extreme conditions. In particular, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) stand out for their wide coverage and low latency advantages, supporting communication reliability and enhancing information freshness, especially in rural areas and regions with infrastructure constraints. In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the age-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks.

| **[Predictive Planner for Autonomous Driving with Consistency Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08033v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and planning are essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. Traditional approaches often treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning. While recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in multi-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for high-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model to build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates higher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion models, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple planning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online guided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and also demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and satisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with Device Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15601v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.</p></details> |  | None |

Multiple kiwifruit detachment mechanisms were designed and field testing of one of the concepts showed that the mechanism could reliably pick kiwifruit. Furthermore, this kiwifruit detachment mechanism was able to reach over 80 percent of fruit in the cluttered kiwifruit canopy, whereas the previous state of the art mechanism was only able to reach less than 70 percent of the fruit. Artificial pollination was performed by detecting flowers and then spraying pollen in solution onto the detected flowers from a line of sprayers on a boom, while driving at up to 1.4 ms-1. In addition, the height of the canopy was measured and the spray boom was moved up and down to keep the boom close enough to the flowers for the spray to reach the flowers, while minimising collisions with the canopy. Mobile robot navigation was performed using a 2D lidar in apple orchards and vineyards. Lidar navigation in kiwifruit orchards was more challenging because the pergola structure only provides a small amount of data for the direction of rows, compared to the amount of data from the overhead canopy, the undulating ground and other objects in the orchards. Multiple methods are presented here for extracting structure defining features from 3D lidar data in kiwifruit orchards. In addition, a 3D lidar navigation system -- which performed row following, row end detection and row end turns -- was tested for over 30 km of autonomous driving in kiwifruit orchards. Computer vision algorithms for row detection and row following were also tested. The computer vision algorithm worked as well as the 3D lidar row following method in testing.</p></details> |  | None |

To imitate this cognitive ability in urban autonomous driving while ensuring the transparency and interpretability, we propose a vision-language model (VLM)-enhanced unified decision-making and motion control framework, named VLM-UDMC. This framework incorporates scene reasoning and risk-aware insights into an upper-level slow system, which dynamically reconfigures the optimal motion planning for the downstream fast system. The reconfiguration is based on real-time environmental changes, which are encoded through context-aware potential functions. More specifically, the upper-level slow system employs a two-step reasoning policy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging foundation models to process multimodal inputs and retrieve contextual knowledge, thereby generating risk-aware insights. Meanwhile, a lightweight multi-kernel decomposed LSTM provides real-time trajectory predictions for heterogeneous traffic participants by extracting smoother trend representations for short-horizon trajectory prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed VLM-UDMC framework is verified via both simulations and real-world experiments with a full-size autonomous vehicle. It is demonstrated that the presented VLM-UDMC effectively leverages scene understanding and attention decomposition for rational driving decisions, thus improving the overall urban driving performance.

This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, decision-making refers specifically to highway lane selection, while motion planning involves generating control commands (such as speed and steering) to reach the chosen lane. In the context of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), achieving both flexible and safe lane selection alongside precise trajectory execution remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a framework called Cohesive Decision-Guided Motion Planning (CDGMP), which tightly integrates decision-making and motion planning using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) inspired architecture combined with multi-policy reinforcement learning. By coordinating multiple specialized sub-networks through a gating mechanism, the method decomposes the complex driving task into modular components. Each sub-network focuses on a specific aspect of driving, improving efficiency by activating only the most relevant modules during inference. This design also enhances safety through modular specialization. CDGMP improves the adaptability and robustness of CAVs across diverse traffic scenarios, offering a scalable solution to real-world autonomy challenges. The architectural principles behind CDGMP, especially the use of MoE, also provide a strong foundation for other high-dimensional decision and control tasks. Simulation results (available at https://youtu.be/_-4OXNHV0UY) demonstrate reliable performance in both lane selection and motion planning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\% to 7.38\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router, GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean.

| **[Preference-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14066v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach for optimizing tasks with multiple objectives. However, it often relies on pre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing conflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as more flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for complicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL (Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL framework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across the entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our method constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given preferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this reward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive experiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task, and an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method performs competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground truth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications in complex real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.
