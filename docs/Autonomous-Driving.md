HyPlan combines methods for multi-agent behavior prediction, deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization and approximated online POMDP planning with heuristic confidence-based vertical pruning to reduce its execution time without compromising safety of driving. Our experimental performance analysis on the CARLA-CTS2 benchmark of critical traffic scenarios with pedestrians revealed that HyPlan may navigate safer than selected relevant baselines and perform significantly faster than considered alternative online POMDP planners.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Digital Twin Framework for Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems Using Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07133v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion, our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario. The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment, we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1 score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing solution for autonomous vehicle safety.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06969v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches, particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose \textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD \textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit, global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[OBJVanish: Physically Realizable Text-to-3D Adv. Generation of LiDAR-Invisible Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06952v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However, existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity, and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation (Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate 3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A risk model and analysis method for the psychological safety of human and autonomous vehicles interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05732v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technologies has significantly propelled the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, psychological barriers continue to impede widespread AV adoption, despite technological progress. This paper addresses the critical yet often overlooked aspect of psychological safety in AV design and operation. While traditional safety standards focus primarily on physical safety, this paper emphasizes the psychological implications that arise from human interactions with autonomous vehicles, highlighting the importance of trust and perceived risk as significant factors influencing user acceptance. The paper makes a methodological proposal, a framework for addressing AVs psychological safety consisting of three key contributions. First, it introduces a definition of psychological safety in AVs context. Secondly, it proposes a risk model for identifying and assessing AVs psychological hazards and risks. PsySIL (Psychological Safety Integrity Level), a classification of AV psychological risk levels is developed. Thirdly, an adapted system-theoretic analysis method for AVs psychological safety is proposed. The paper illustrates the application of the framework for assessing potential psychological hazards using a scenario involving a family's experience with an autonomous vehicle, pioneering a systems approach towards evaluating situations that could lead to psychological harm. By establishing a framework that incorporates psychological safety alongside physical safety, the paper contributes to the broader discourse on the safe deployment of autonomous vehicle, aiming to guide future developments in user-centred design and regulatory practices, while acknowledging the limitations brought by the application of the proposals on a rather simple but pedagogical illustrative example.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DecompGAIL: Learning Realistic Traffic Behaviors with Decomposed Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06913v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Algorithm Based on Light Field and LiDAR Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06687v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps, enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

The competition is built upon a newly established evaluation benchmark featuring challenging low-light noisy images captured in the wild using five different DSLR cameras. Participants are tasked with developing novel noise synthesis pipelines, network architectures, and training methodologies to achieve high performance across different camera models. Winners are determined based on a combination of performance metrics, including full-reference measures (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), and non-reference ones (ARNIQA, TOPIQ). By pushing the boundaries of camera-agnostic low-light RAW image denoising trained on synthetic data, the competition promotes the development of robust and practical models aligned with the rapid progress in digital photography. We expect the competition outcomes to influence multiple domains, from image restoration to night-time autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Drive&Gen: Co-Evaluating End-to-End Driving and Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06209v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[From Learning to Mastery: Achieving Safe and Efficient Real-World Autonomous Driving with Human-In-The-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06038v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient learning for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Safety Challenge of World Models for Embodied AI Agents: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05865v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ALISE: Annotation-Free LiDAR Instance Segmentation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05752v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth (GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Precise and Efficient Collision Prediction under Uncertainty in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05729v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research introduces two efficient methods to estimate the collision risk of planned trajectories in autonomous driving under uncertain driving conditions. Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors, and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning. The collision estimation methods are available as open-source software: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/Collision-Probability-Estimation</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to the IEEE ICRA 2026, Vienna, Austria</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/TUM-AVS/Collision-Probability-Estimation) |
| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Automotive LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04969v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, self-supervised representation learning relying on vast amounts of unlabeled data has been explored as a pre-training method for autonomous driving. However, directly applying popular contrastive or generative methods to this problem is insufficient and may even lead to negative transfer. In this paper, we present AD-L-JEPA, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework with a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) for automotive LiDAR object detection. Unlike existing methods, AD-L-JEPA is neither generative nor contrastive. Instead of explicitly generating masked regions, our method predicts Bird's-Eye-View embeddings to capture the diverse nature of driving scenes. Furthermore, our approach eliminates the need to manually form contrastive pairs by employing explicit variance regularization to avoid representation collapse. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements on the LiDAR 3D object detection downstream task across the KITTI3D, Waymo, and ONCE datasets, while reducing GPU hours by 1.9x-2.7x and GPU memory by 2.8x-4x compared with the state-of-the-art method Occupancy-MAE. Notably, on the largest ONCE dataset, pre-training on 100K frames yields a 1.61 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 100K or 500K frames, and pre-training on 500K frames yields a 2.98 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 500K or 1M frames. AD-L-JEPA constitutes the first JEPA-based pre-training method for autonomous driving. It offers better quality, faster, and more GPU-memory-efficient self-supervised representation learning. The source code of AD-L-JEPA is ready to be released.</p></details> |  | None |

This study compares four object detection models--YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet--for motorbike detection using a custom dataset of 198 images collected in Kigali. Implemented in PyTorch with transfer learning, the models were evaluated for accuracy, localization, and inference speed to assess their suitability for real-time navigation in resource-constrained settings. We identify implementation challenges, including dataset limitations and model complexities, and recommend simplified architectures for future work to enhance accessibility for autonomous systems in developing countries like Rwanda.</p></details> | 3 figures, 2 tables | None |
| **[Progressive Gaussian Transformer with Anisotropy-aware Sampling for Open Vocabulary Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04759v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be released upon publication on our project page: https://yanchi-3dv.github.io/PG-Occ</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yanchi-3dv.github.io/PG-Occ</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yanchi-3dv.github.io/PG-Occ) |
| **[A Knowledge-Driven Diffusion Policy for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Based on Expert Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04853v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the difficulty of producing adaptive, robust, and interpretable decision-making across diverse scenarios. Existing methods often collapse diverse driving behaviors, lack long-horizon consistency, or require task-specific engineering that limits generalization. This paper presents KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion component generates temporally coherent action sequences, while the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://perfectxu88.github.io/KDP-AD/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://perfectxu88.github.io/KDP-AD) |
| **[Diffusion^2: Dual Diffusion Model with Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Noise for Momentary Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04365v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[AutoDrive-QA: A Multiple-Choice Benchmark for Vision-Language Evaluation in Urban Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15778v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in urban driving contexts remains challenging, as existing benchmarks rely on open-ended responses that are ambiguous, annotation-intensive, and inconsistent to score. This lack of standardized evaluation slows progress toward safe and reliable AI for urban mobility. We introduce AutoDrive-QA, the first benchmark that systematically converts open-ended driving QA datasets (DriveLM, NuScenes-QA, LingoQA) into structured multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with distractors grounded in five realistic error categories: Driving Domain Misconceptions, Logical Inconsistencies, Misinterpreted Sensor Inputs, Computational Oversights, and Question Ambiguity. This framework enables reproducible and interpretable evaluation of VLMs across perception, prediction, and planning tasks in complex urban scenes. Experiments show that fine-tuning LLaVA-1.5-7B improves accuracy by about six percentage points across tasks, GPT-4V achieves the strongest zero-shot performance with up to 69.8% accuracy, and Qwen2-VL models also perform competitively, particularly in multi-view settings. Moreover, traditional metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr fail to distinguish strong from weak models. By providing an objective, domain-grounded evaluation protocol, AutoDrive-QA contributes to more transparent benchmarking of urban AI systems, supporting the development of safer and more trustworthy autonomous driving technologies for smart cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated results with larger dataset experiments and expanded discussion</p></details> | None |
| **[From Filters to VLMs: Benchmarking Defogging Methods through Object Detection and Segmentation Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03906v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance. Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in vision-language learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks. However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC) dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the SOREC dataset.

This paper introduces a bi-level control framework that efficiently augments road boundaries by incorporating time-dependent grid projections of obstacle movements, thus enabling precise and adaptive path planning. The main control loop utilizes Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for real-time path optimization, wherein homotopy-based constraint relaxation is employed to improve the solvability of the optimal control problem (OCP). Furthermore, an independent backup loop runs concurrently to provide safe fallback trajectories when an optimal trajectory cannot be computed by the main loop within a critical time frame, thus enhancing safety and real-time performance. Our evaluation showcases the benefits of the proposed methods in various driving scenarios, highlighting the real-time applicability and robustness of our approach. Overall, the framework represents a significant step towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving in complex and dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 IEEE 101st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2025-Spring), Oslo, Norway, June 17-20, 2025.

Large vision foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters.

| **[GS-Share: Enabling High-fidelity Map Sharing with Incremental Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02884v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications, including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction. However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous updates, and network efficiency remains elusive. To address these challenges, we introduce GS-Share, a photorealistic map-sharing system with a compact representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update. We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively. Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission overhead by 36%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[Vehicle-Scene Interaction: A Text-Driven 3D Lidar Place Recognition Method for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18035v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environment description-based localization in large-scale point cloud maps constructed through remote sensing is critically significant for the advancement of large-scale autonomous systems, such as delivery robots operating in the last mile. However, current approaches encounter challenges due to the inability of point cloud encoders to effectively capture local details and long-range spatial relationships, as well as a significant modality gap between text and point cloud representations. To address these challenges, we present Des4Pos, a novel two-stage text-driven remote sensing localization framework. In the coarse stage, the point-cloud encoder utilizes the Multi-scale Fusion Attention Mechanism (MFAM) to enhance local geometric features, followed by a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to strengthen global spatial relationships. Concurrently, the Stepped Text Encoder (STE) integrates cross-modal prior knowledge from CLIP [1] and aligns text and point-cloud features using this prior knowledge, effectively bridging modality discrepancies. In the fine stage, we introduce a Cascaded Residual Attention (CRA) module to fuse cross-modal features and predict relative localization offsets, thereby achieving greater localization precision. Experiments on the KITTI360Pose test set demonstrate that Des4Pos achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-point-cloud place recognition. Specifically, it attains a top-1 accuracy of 40% and a top-10 accuracy of 77% under a 5-meter radius threshold, surpassing the best existing methods by 7% and 7%, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |
| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Work Zones challenge VLM Trajectory Planning: Toward Mitigation and Robust Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02803v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures | None |
| **[A Trajectory Generator for High-Density Traffic and Diverse Agent-Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02627v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments. However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication addresses these limits by enabling collaboration across vehicles and infrastructure, but it also faces heterogeneity, synchronization, and latency constraints. Language models offer strong knowledge-driven reasoning and decision-making capabilities, but they are not inherently designed to process raw sensor streams and are prone to hallucination. We propose V2X-UniPool, the first framework that unifies V2X perception with language-based reasoning for knowledge-driven AD. It transforms multimodal V2X data into structured, language-based knowledge, organizes it in a time-indexed knowledge pool for temporally consistent reasoning, and employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground decisions in real-time context. Experiments on the real-world DAIR-V2X dataset show that V2X-UniPool achieves state-of-the-art planning accuracy and safety while reducing communication cost by more than 80\%, achieving the lowest overhead among evaluated methods. These results highlight the promise of bridging V2X perception and language reasoning to advance scalable and trustworthy driving.

LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions.

This work addresses confidence calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same method.</p></details> |  | None |

Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

| **[Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01545v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference, converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11 + BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for AV pipelines.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin.

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

In parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy, generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants, and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy, bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents.</p></details> |  | None |

While many detection models aim to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern. In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN) alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

We propose a multi-view projection framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our method aligns LiDAR scans into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to generate large-scale synthetic 2D datasets (PC2D) in various modalities. An ensemble of 2D segmentation models is trained on these modalities, and during inference, hundreds of views per scene are processed, with logits back-projected to 3D using an occlusion-aware voting scheme to produce point-wise labels. These labels can be used directly or to fine-tune a 3D segmentation model in the target domain. We evaluate our approach in both Real-to-Real and Simulation-to-Real UDA, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Real-to-Real setting. Furthermore, we show that our framework enables segmentation of rare classes, leveraging only 2D annotations for those classes while relying on 3D annotations for others in the source domain.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[NuRisk: A Visual Question Answering Dataset for Agent-Level Risk Assessment in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25944v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context. Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View (BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements.

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines. Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths, this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents.

| **[Adaptive Conformal Guidance for Learning under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16736v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning systems. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a broadly applicable solution for learning under uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods typically formulate trajectory planning as a language modeling task, where physical actions are output in the language space, potentially leading to issues such as format-violating outputs, infeasible actions, and slow inference speeds. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, a novel Reinforced Cognitive framework for end-to-end autonomous Driving, unifying driving understanding and planning by integrating an autoregressive model with a diffusion planner. First, to instill human driving cognition into the VLM, we introduce a hierarchical data pipeline that mimics the sequential cognitive process of human drivers through three stages: generation, refinement, and quality control. Building on this cognitive foundation, we then address the language-action mismatch by injecting the VLM's learned driving priors into a diffusion planner to efficiently generate continuous and stable trajectories. Furthermore, to enhance driving safety and reduce collisions, we introduce a Diffusion Group Relative Policy Optimization (DiffGRPO) stage, reinforcing the planner for enhanced safety and comfort. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that ReCogDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, qualitative results across diverse driving scenarios and DriveBench highlight the model's scene comprehension. All code, model weights, and datasets will be made publicly available to facilitate subsequent research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite the perception stability in harsh environments, the point cloud generated by mmWave radar is relatively sparse while containing significant noise, which limits its further development. Traditional mmWave radar enhancement approaches often struggle to leverage the effectiveness of diffusion models in super-resolution, largely due to the unnatural range-azimuth heatmap (RAH) or bird's eye view (BEV) representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that pioneers the application of fusing range images with image diffusion models, achieving accurate and dense mmWave radar point clouds that are similar to LiDAR. Benefitting from the projection that aligns with human observation, the range image representation of mmWave radar is close to natural images, allowing the knowledge from pre-trained image diffusion models to be effectively transferred, significantly improving the overall performance. Extensive evaluations on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets demonstrate that our approach provides substantial improvements, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in generating truly three-dimensional LiDAR-like point clouds via mmWave radar.

However, their effectiveness in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next, we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs, the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.</p></details> |  | None |

Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception; however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to address the Sensor2Sensor domain gap in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of state-of-the-art CP methods and S2S-Net is conducted on the SCOPE dataset. This study shows that, all evaluated state-of-the-art mehtods for collective perception highly suffer from the Sensor2Sensor domain gap, while S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high performance in unseen sensor domains and outperforms the evaluated state-of-the-art methods by up to 44 percentage points.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\% to 7.38\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

A key component of these systems is the shared function library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process sensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical role in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored vulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based attack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven multi-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how agents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions to select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command formats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with deceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as misinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other agents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two representative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its ability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific agents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms. Our results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple toolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving systems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.</p></details> |  | None |

In complex urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing data-driven simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training framework in enhancing foundation models.

Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness.

Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more realistic simulations in CARLA.

| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v4)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> | None |

To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, which establishes an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline}, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and \textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate that AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by \textbf{53.91%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54%}, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities.

This survey systematically reviews four core research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception. Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models. Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Delta-Triplane Transformers as Occupancy World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07338v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occupancy World Models (OWMs) aim to predict future scenes via 3D voxelized representations of the environment to support intelligent motion planning. Existing approaches typically generate full future occupancy states from VAE-style latent encodings, which can be computationally expensive and redundant. We propose Delta-Triplane Transformers (DTT), a novel 4D OWM for autonomous driving, that introduces two key innovations: (1) a triplane based representation that encodes 3D occupancy more compactly than previous approaches, and (2) an incremental prediction strategy for OWM that models {\em changes} in occupancy rather than dealing with full states. The core insight is that changes in the compact 3D latent space are naturally sparser and easier to model, enabling higher accuracy with a lighter-weight architecture. Building on this representation, DTT extracts multi-scale motion features from historical data and iteratively predict future triplane deltas. These deltas are combined with past states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTT delivers a 1.44$\times$ speedup (26 FPS) over the state of the art, improves mean IoU to 30.85, and reduces the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.</p></details> |  | None |

Data-driven defenses such as jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding, while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100% with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications.

However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness throughout extended driving sequences.</p></details> |  | None |

To advance the field, several competitive platforms and benchmarks have been established to provide standardized datasets and evaluation protocols. Among these, leaderboards by the CARLA organization and nuPlan and the Waymo Open Dataset have become leading benchmarks for assessing motion planning algorithms.

Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on NavSim benchmark.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps. We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with significantly reduced computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior, known as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to deployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study comparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL), Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing. Using a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and LiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS architectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios involving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We systematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three dimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity. Our results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of real-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without compromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under which failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the underlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies. Our findings offer actionable insights into the respective strengths and limitations of each modality and outline a path toward more robust and transferable validation of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '25)</p></details> | None |

Traditional large-scale map construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions, outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods, resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen, for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1) representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3) developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset.

However, existing methods are often constrained by a passive perception paradigm, relying solely on text-based reasoning. This passivity restricts the model's capacity to actively seek crucial visual evidence when faced with uncertainty. To address this, we introduce DriveAgent-R1, the first autonomous driving agent capable of active perception for planning. In complex scenarios, DriveAgent-R1 proactively invokes tools to perform visual reasoning, firmly grounding its decisions in visual evidence, thereby enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid thinking framework, inspired by human driver cognitive patterns, allowing the agent to adaptively switch between efficient text-only reasoning and robust tool-augmented visual reasoning based on scene complexity. This capability is cultivated through a three-stage progressive training strategy, featuring a core Cascaded Reinforcement Learning (Cascaded RL) phase. Extensive experiments on the Drive-Internal dataset, which is rich in long-tail scenarios, and the public nuScenes dataset show that, with only 3B parameters, DriveAgent-R1 achieves competitive performance comparable to top closed model systems such as GPT-5 and to human driving proficiency while remaining deployment-friendly, offering a proven path toward building more intelligent autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations.

| **[An Adaptive ICP LiDAR Odometry Based on Reliable Initial Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22058v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map, achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds. Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy of LiDAR odometry.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability.

To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings.

While Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction, most existing approaches overlook the inherent spatial dependencies and semantic relationships among map elements, which constrains their accuracy and generalization capabilities. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that explicitly models both spatial relations and semantic priors to enhance online HD map construction. Specifically, we introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. RelMap is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, scan generation remains challenging, especially when compared to the rapid advancement of image and 3D object generation. We consider the task of LiDAR object generation, requiring models to produce 3D objects as viewed by a LiDAR scan. It focuses LiDAR scan generation on a key aspect of scenes, the objects, while also benefiting from advancements in 3D object generative methods. We introduce a novel diffusion-based model to produce LiDAR point clouds of dataset objects, including intensity, and with an extensive control of the generation via conditioning information.

To address these challenges, we propose PL-VIWO2, a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that integrates an IMU, wheel encoder, and camera (supporting both monocular and stereo) for long-term robust state estimation. The main contributions are: (i) a novel line feature processing framework that exploits the geometric relationship between 2D feature points and lines, enabling fast and robust line tracking and triangulation while ensuring real-time performance; (ii) an SE(2)-constrained SE(3) wheel pre-integration method that leverages the planar motion characteristics of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates; and (iii) an efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that filters out dynamic features by jointly using IMU and wheel measurements. Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo simulations and public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PL-VIWO2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[GVDepth: Zero-Shot Monocular Depth Estimation for Ground Vehicles based on Probabilistic Cue Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06080v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing metric monocular depth estimation presents a significant challenge due to its ill-posed nature, while the entanglement between camera parameters and depth amplifies issues further, hindering multi-dataset training and zero-shot accuracy. This challenge is particularly evident in autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics, where data is collected with fixed camera setups, limiting the geometric diversity. Yet, this context also presents an opportunity: the fixed relationship between the camera and the ground plane imposes additional perspective geometry constraints, enabling depth regression via vertical image positions of objects. However, this cue is highly susceptible to overfitting, thus we propose a novel canonical representation that maintains consistency across varied camera setups, effectively disentangling depth from specific parameters and enhancing generalization across datasets. We also propose a novel architecture that adaptively and probabilistically fuses depths estimated via object size and vertical image position cues. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on five autonomous driving datasets, achieving accurate metric depth estimation for varying resolutions, aspect ratios and camera setups. Notably, we achieve comparable accuracy to existing zero-shot methods, despite training on a single dataset with a single-camera setup.

| **[Autoregressive End-to-End Planning with Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment and Multi-Objective Policy Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20938v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head (i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories. Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models.

A critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive decision-making. MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits. This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously evaluate zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach. On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\% and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more reliable systems.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV2025 Workshop on Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI Systems</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion) |
| **[Cyber Racing Coach: A Haptic Shared Control Framework for Teaching Advanced Driving Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20653v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability</p></details> | IWACIII 2025 | None |
| **[Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20196v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods.

| **[Steerable Adversarial Scenario Generation through Test-Time Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20102v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator (SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving policies.

The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance metrics of 67.1 NDS and 63.1 AMOTA.

This capability, however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then, harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation, we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods rely on single-modal data sharing, limiting fusion performance, particularly in heterogeneous sensor settings involving both LiDAR and cameras across vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). To address this, we propose Radian Glue Attention (RG-Attn), a lightweight and generalizable cross-modal fusion module that unifies intra-agent and inter-agent fusion via transformation-based coordinate alignment and a unified sampling/inversion strategy. RG-Attn efficiently aligns features through a radian-based attention constraint, operating column-wise on geometrically consistent regions to reduce overhead and preserve spatial coherence, thereby enabling accurate and robust fusion. Building upon RG-Attn, we propose three cooperative architectures. The first, Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP), prioritizes communication efficiency but assumes all agents have LiDAR, optionally paired with cameras. The second, Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), offers maximal flexibility, supporting any sensor setup (e.g., LiDAR-only, camera-only, or both) and enabling strong cross-modal generalization for real-world deployment. The third, Pyramid-RG-Attn Fusion (PRGAF), aims for peak detection accuracy with the highest computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show our framework delivers state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high flexibility and efficiency.

Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation (EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intend to submit to RA-L</p></details> | None |

On the other hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents, regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |

However, LiDAR's high cost continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality of the produced point clouds.

While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we study a data augmentation strategy that leverages the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured by the AV's sensors, as additional demonstrations. We introduce a simple vehicle-selection sampling and filtering strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer dataset for training. We evaluate this idea with a representative learning-based planner on a large real-world dataset and demonstrate improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, the approach reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10 percent of the original dataset, the method matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset. Through ablations, we analyze selection criteria and show that naive random selection can degrade performance. Our findings highlight the value of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/lyra/</p></details> | None |

Traditional rule-based localization involves many standalone modules, which is theoretically fragile and requires costly hyperparameter tuning, therefore sacrificing the accuracy and generalization. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end visual localization system, RAVE, in which the surrounding images are associated with the HD map data to estimate pose. To ensure high-quality observations for localization, a low-rank flow-based prior fusion module (FLORA) is developed to incorporate misaligned map prior into the perceived BEV features. Pursuing a balance among efficiency, interpretability, and accuracy, a hierarchical localization module is proposed, which efficiently estimates poses through a decoupled BEV neural matching-based pose solver (DEMA) using rasterized HD map, and then refines the estimation through a Transformer-based pose regressor (POET) using vectorized HD map. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can perform robust and accurate localization under varying environmental conditions while running efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop</p></details> | None |

Real crash reports contain precisely the contrastive evidence needed, but they are hard to use: narratives are unstructured, third-person, and poorly grounded to sensor views. We address these challenges by normalizing crash narratives to ego-centric language and converting both logs and crashes into a unified scene-action representation suitable for retrieval. At decision time, our system adjudicates proposed actions by retrieving relevant precedents from this unified index; an agentic counterfactual extension proposes plausible alternatives, retrieves for each, and reasons across outcomes before deciding. On a nuScenes benchmark, precedent retrieval substantially improves calibration, with recall on contextually preferred actions rising from 24% to 53%. The counterfactual variant preserves these gains while sharpening decisions near risk.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

Built upon a multi-modal large language model foundation like Gemini, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR.

Nevertheless, its point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components: the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module. Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP. Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges such as scene understanding and effective prediction for decision-making continue to present substantial obstacles to its large-scale deployment. In this paper, we present PIE, a pioneering framework that integrates advanced perception, reasoning, and intention modeling to dynamically capture interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. It incorporates a bidirectional Mamba fusion that addresses data compression losses in multimodal fusion of camera and LiDAR inputs, alongside a novel reasoning-enhanced decoder integrating Mamba and Mixture-of-Experts to facilitate scene-compliant anchor selection and optimize adaptive trajectory inference. PIE adopts an action-motion interaction module to effectively utilize state predictions of surrounding agents to refine ego planning. The proposed framework is thoroughly validated on the NAVSIM benchmark. PIE, without using any ensemble and data augmentation techniques, achieves an 88.9 PDM score and 85.6 EPDM score, surpassing the performance of prior state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that PIE is capable of reliably generating feasible and high-quality ego trajectories.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing BEV approaches encounter significant challenges due to the large feature space, complicating efficient modeling and hindering effective integration of global attention mechanisms. We propose a novel modeling strategy, called InstanceBEV, that synergistically combines the strengths of both map-centric approaches and object-centric approaches. Our method effectively extracts instance-level features within the BEV features, facilitating the implementation of global attention modeling in a highly compressed feature space, thereby addressing the efficiency challenges inherent in map-centric global modeling. Furthermore, our approach enables effective multi-task learning without introducing additional module. We validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model through predicting occupancy, achieving 3D occupancy panoptic segmentation by combining instance information. Experimental results on the OCC3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate that InstanceBEV, utilizing only 8 frames, achieves a RayPQ of 15.3 and a RayIoU of 38.2. This surpasses SparseOcc's RayPQ by 9.3% and RayIoU by 10.7%, showcasing the effectiveness of multi-task synergy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spatial Envelope MPC: High Performance Driving without a Reference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18506v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel envelope based model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to enable autonomous vehicles to handle high performance driving across a wide range of scenarios without a predefined reference. In high performance autonomous driving, safe operation at the vehicle's dynamic limits requires a real time planning and control framework capable of accounting for key vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints when following a predefined reference trajectory is suboptimal or even infeasible. State of the art planning and control frameworks, however, are predominantly reference based, which limits their performance in such situations. To address this gap, this work first introduces a computationally efficient vehicle dynamics model tailored for optimization based control and a continuously differentiable mathematical formulation that accurately captures the entire drivable envelope. This novel model and formulation allow for the direct integration of dynamic feasibility and safety constraints into a unified planning and control framework, thereby removing the necessity for predefined references. The challenge of envelope planning, which refers to maximally approximating the safe drivable area, is tackled by combining reinforcement learning with optimization techniques. The framework is validated through both simulations and real world experiments, demonstrating its high performance across a variety of tasks, including racing, emergency collision avoidance and off road navigation. These results highlight the framework's scalability and broad applicability across a diverse set of scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, deploying LLM-driven planning in the physical world demands strict adherence to safety and regulatory constraints, which current models often violate due to hallucination or weak alignment. Traditional data-driven alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), require costly human labeling, while recent formal-feedback approaches still depend on resource-intensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose LAD-VF, a fine-tuning-free framework that leverages formal verification feedback for automated prompt engineering. By introducing a formal-verification-informed text loss integrated with LLM-AutoDiff, LAD-VF iteratively refines prompts rather than model parameters. This yields three key benefits: (i) scalable adaptation without fine-tuning; (ii) compatibility with modular LLM architectures; and (iii) interpretable refinement via auditable prompts. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that LAD-VF substantially enhances specification compliance, improving success rates from 60% to over 90%. Our method thus presents a scalable and interpretable pathway toward trustworthy, formally-verified LLM-driven control systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in cooperative perception, prediction, and planning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, mainstream methods trained via imitation learning suffer from critical safety limitations, as they fail to distinguish between trajectories that appear human-like but are potentially unsafe. Some recent approaches attempt to address this by regressing multiple rule-driven scores but decoupling supervision from policy optimization, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose DriveDPO, a Safety Direct Preference Optimization Policy Learning framework. First, we distill a unified policy distribution from human imitation similarity and rule-based safety scores for direct policy optimization. Further, we introduce an iterative Direct Preference Optimization stage formulated as trajectory-level preference alignment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that DriveDPO achieves a new state-of-the-art PDMS of 90.0. Furthermore, qualitative results across diverse challenging scenarios highlight DriveDPO's ability to produce safer and more reliable driving behaviors.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, this paper investigates the problem of communication resource allocation for collaborative perception and proposes RACooper, a novel RSU-assisted resource allocation framework that maximizes perception accuracy under constrained communication resources. RACooper leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning model to dynamically allocate communication resources while accounting for real-time sensing data and channel dynamics induced by vehicular mobility. By jointly optimizing spatial confidence metrics and channel state information, our approach ensures efficient feature transmission, enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative perception. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to conventional baseline algorithms, RACooper achieves significant improvements in perception accuracy, especially under bandwidth-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline.

However, current generation-then-evaluation frameworks typically construct multiple plausible trajectory hypotheses but ultimately adopt a single most likely outcome, leading to overconfident decisions and a lack of fallback strategies that are vital for safety in rare but critical scenarios. Moreover, the usual decoupling of prediction and planning modules could result in socially inconsistent or unrealistic joint trajectories, especially in highly interactive traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a contingency-aware diffusion planner (CoPlanner), a unified framework that jointly models multi-agent interactive trajectory generation and contingency-aware motion planning. Specifically, the pivot-conditioned diffusion mechanism anchors trajectory sampling on a validated, shared short-term segment to preserve temporal consistency, while stochastically generating diverse long-horizon branches that capture multimodal motion evolutions. In parallel, we design a contingency-aware multi-scenario scoring strategy that evaluates candidate ego trajectories across multiple plausible long-horizon evolution scenarios, balancing safety, progress, and comfort. This integrated design preserves feasible fallback options and enhances robustness under uncertainty, leading to more realistic interaction-aware planning. Extensive closed-loop experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that CoPlanner consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both Val14 and Test14 datasets, achieving significant improvements in safety and comfort under both reactive and non-reactive settings.

Specifically, a centralized orchestrator plans high-level training objectives, while a generation module employs a two-step analyze-then-generate process for efficient generation of reward-curriculum pairs. A reflection module then facilitates iterative optimization based on the online evaluation. Furthermore, a dedicated memory module endows the VLM agents with the capabilities of long-term memory. To enhance robustness and diversity of the generation process, we introduce a parallel generation scheme and a human-in-the-loop technique for augmentation of the reward observation space. Through efficient multi-agent cooperation and leveraging rich multimodal information, OGR enables the online evolution of reinforcement learning policies to acquire interaction-aware driving skills. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the superior performance, robust generalizability across distinct urban scenarios, and strong compatibility with various RL algorithms. Further real-world experiments highlight the practical viability and effectiveness of our framework. The source code will be available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RIFT: Group-Relative RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03344v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both realism and controllability in closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel group-relative RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative formulation and employs a surrogate objective for stable optimization, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 | None |

With high operating speeds, dynamic environments, and head-to-head interactions, autonomous racing requires algorithms that diverge from those in classical autonomous driving. Training such algorithms is particularly challenging: the need for rapid decision-making at high speeds severely limits model capacity. To address this, we propose End2Race, a novel end-to-end imitation learning algorithm designed for head-to-head autonomous racing. End2Race leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture to capture continuous temporal dependencies, enabling both short-term responsiveness and long-term strategic planning. We also adopt a sigmoid-based normalization function that transforms raw LiDAR scans into spatial pressure tokens, facilitating effective model training and convergence. The algorithm is extremely efficient, achieving an inference time of less than 0.5 milliseconds on a consumer-class GPU. Experiments in the F1Tenth simulator demonstrate that End2Race achieves a 94.2% safety rate across 2,400 overtaking scenarios, each with an 8-second time limit, and successfully completes overtakes in 59.2% of cases. This surpasses previous methods and establishes ours as a leading solution for the F1Tenth racing testbed.

This work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets validated the proposed system's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>2022....</summary><p>2022. 117p.

It provides control over various environmental parameters, enabling thorough evaluation. Development bounding boxes are commonly utilized tools in deep learning and play a crucial role in AD applications. The predominant method for data generation in the CARLA Simulator involves identifying and delineating objects of interest, such as vehicles, using bounding boxes. The operation in CARLA entails capturing the coordinates of all objects on the map, which are subsequently aligned with the sensor's coordinate system at the ego vehicle and then enclosed within bounding boxes relative to the ego vehicle's perspective. However, this primary approach encounters challenges associated with object detection and bounding box annotation, such as ghost boxes. Although these procedures are generally effective at detecting vehicles and other objects within their direct line of sight, they may also produce false positives by identifying objects that are obscured by obstructions. We have enhanced the primary approach with the objective of filtering out unwanted boxes. Performance analysis indicates that the improved approach has achieved high accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 12 figures,VEHITS Conference 2024</p></details> | None |

To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature.

| **[Are VLMs Ready for Lane Topology Awareness in Autonomous Driving?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16654v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning, yet their applications in autonomous driving remain limited. In particular, the ability to understand road topology, a key requirement for safe navigation, has received relatively little attention. While some recent works have begun to explore VLMs in driving contexts, their performance on topology reasoning is far from satisfactory. In this work, we systematically evaluate VLMs' capabilities in road topology understanding. Specifically, multi-view images are projected into unified ground-plane coordinate system and fused into bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Based on these BEV lanes, we formulate four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks, which together capture essential components of spatial topology reasoning. Through extensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some temporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in vector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source VLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also find that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size, length of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[ADVEDM:Fine-grained Adversarial Attack against VLM-based Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16645v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their strong reasoning and planning capabilities, are widely used in embodied decision-making (EDM) tasks in embodied agents, such as autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. Recent research has increasingly explored adversarial attacks on VLMs to reveal their vulnerabilities. However, these attacks either rely on overly strong assumptions, requiring full knowledge of the victim VLM, which is impractical for attacking VLM-based agents, or exhibit limited effectiveness. The latter stems from disrupting most semantic information in the image, which leads to a misalignment between the perception and the task context defined by system prompts. This inconsistency interrupts the VLM's reasoning process, resulting in invalid outputs that fail to affect interactions in the physical world. To this end, we propose a fine-grained adversarial attack framework, ADVEDM, which modifies the VLM's perception of only a few key objects while preserving the semantics of the remaining regions. This attack effectively reduces conflicts with the task context, making VLMs output valid but incorrect decisions and affecting the actions of agents, thus posing a more substantial safety threat in the physical world. We design two variants of based on this framework, ADVEDM-R and ADVEDM-A, which respectively remove the semantics of a specific object from the image and add the semantics of a new object into the image. The experimental results in both general scenarios and EDM tasks demonstrate fine-grained control and excellent attack performance.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce SQS, a novel query-based splatting pre-training specifically designed to advance SPMs in autonomous driving. SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian representations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the reconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the pre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks via query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries with task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements of occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable performance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in occupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior state-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3 mIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | None |

Recent advances have explored utilizing 3D semantic Gaussians to model occupancy while reducing computational overhead, but they remain constrained by insufficient multi-view spatial interaction and limited multi-frame temporal consistency. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Gaussian Splatting (ST-GS) framework to enhance both spatial and temporal modeling in existing Gaussian-based pipelines. Specifically, we develop a guidance-informed spatial aggregation strategy within a dual-mode attention mechanism to strengthen spatial interaction in Gaussian representations. Furthermore, we introduce a geometry-aware temporal fusion scheme that effectively leverages historical context to improve temporal continuity in scene completion. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes occupancy prediction benchmark showcase that our proposed approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also delivers markedly better temporal consistency compared to existing Gaussian-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  | None |

Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing for convergence stability and generalization.

A single vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches, leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities. In experiments on $\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$ and $\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves driving safety by up to ${\it 20.7}\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions.

In contrast, scene graph models make use of annotated data such as masks and bounding boxes from autonomous-driving datasets to capture complex 3D spatial relationships, but their implicit volumetric node representations are challenging to edit view-consistently. We propose Neural Atlas Graphs (NAGs), a hybrid high-resolution scene representation, where every graph node is a view-dependent neural atlas, facilitating both 2D appearance editing and 3D ordering and positioning of scene elements. Fit at test-time, NAGs achieve state-of-the-art quantitative results on the Waymo Open Dataset - by 5 dB PSNR increase compared to existing methods - and make environmental editing possible in high resolution and visual quality - creating counterfactual driving scenarios with new backgrounds and edited vehicle appearance. We find that the method also generalizes beyond driving scenes and compares favorably - by more than 7 dB in PSNR - to recent matting and video editing baselines on the DAVIS video dataset with a diverse set of human and animal-centric scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization, yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of 3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera was always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but mechanical vibration, road bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As there is relatively limited research on the impact of calibration on fusion detection performance, multi-sensor detection methods with flexible calibration dependency have remained a key objective. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the sensitivity of the SOTA EPNet++ detection framework and prove that even slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. To address this vulnerability, we propose a re-calibration model to re-calibrate the misalignment in detection tasks. This model integrates LiDAR point cloud, camera image, and initial calibration matrix as inputs, generating re-calibrated bias through semantic segmentation guidance and a tailored loss function design. The re-calibration model can operate with existing detection algorithms, enhancing both robustness against calibration bias and overall object detection performance. Our approach establishes a foundational methodology for maintaining reliability in multi-modal perception systems under real-world calibration uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IST 2025.

It effectively performs early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy. The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors is designed to generate the final complete trajectories.

These rare cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution, but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions. Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and 15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences.

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</p></details> |  | None |

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at RLC 2025; published in RLJ 2025</p></details> | None |

To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  | None |

In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks. On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Numerous studies in this field have already achieved significant results, demonstrating high effectiveness in addressing traffic sign recognition tasks. However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, we introduce RaFD, a radar-based object detection framework that estimates inter-frame bird's-eye-view (BEV) flow and leverages the resulting geometric cues to enhance detection accuracy. Specifically, we design a supervised flow estimation auxiliary task that is jointly trained with the detection network. The estimated flow is further utilized to guide feature propagation from the previous frame to the current one. Our flow-guided, radar-only detector achieves achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RADIATE dataset, underscoring the importance of incorporating geometric information to effectively interpret radar signals, which are inherently ambiguous in semantics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Online Slip Detection and Friction Coefficient Estimation for Autonomous Racing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15423v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions, and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution by the first three authors</p></details> | None |

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

In this paper, a digital twin (DT)-based cooperative driving system with roadside unit (RSU)-centric architecture is proposed for enhancing safety and efficiency at unsignalized intersections. The system leverages comprehensive bird-eye-view (BEV) perception to eliminate blind spots and employs a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework combining offline pre-training with online fine-tuning. Specifically, driving policies are initially trained using conservative Q-learning (CQL) with behavior cloning (BC) on real datasets, then fine-tuned using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with self-attention mechanisms to handle dynamic multi-agent coordination. The RSU implements real-time commands via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields failure rates below 0.03\% coordinating up to three connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), significantly outperforming traditional methods. In addition, the system exhibits sub-linear computational scaling with inference times under 40 ms. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust generalization across diverse unsignalized intersection scenarios, indicating its practicality and readiness for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

In this sense, it hinders their effective deployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by providing attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the model to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the driver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E better aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for navigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality importance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach dynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that the complementary information from visual and textual modalities is effectively utilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our method facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving environments. We evaluate VLM-E2E on the nuScenes dataset and achieve significant improvements in perception, prediction, and planning over the baseline end-to-end model, showcasing the effectiveness of our attention-enhanced BEV representation in enabling more accurate and reliable autonomous driving tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation, whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly improving compression efficiency and processing performance.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

Current SD-map-based approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g., OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FlowDrive: Energy Flow Field for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14303v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning, autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft, rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3, surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality.

We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model. Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> | None |

Notably, a specialized parking dataset is constructed for parking scenarios, which include those without interference from the opposite vehicle (OV) and complex ones involving interactions with the OV. Based on this dataset, a goal-conditioned state encoder is pretrained to map the fused perception information into the latent space. Then, an offline RL policy is optimized with a conservative regularizer that penalizes out-of-distribution actions. Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator. Comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework with the highest success rate and robust generalization to out-of-distribution parking scenarios.

As newer and bigger state-of-the-art prediction models for autonomous driving continue to emerge, an important open challenge is the problem of how to combine the strengths of these big models without the need for costly re-training. We show how, perhaps surprisingly, combining state-of-the-art deep learning models out-of-the-box (without retraining or fine-tuning) with a simple confidence-weighted average method can enhance the overall prediction. Indeed, while combining trajectory prediction models is not straightforward, this simple approach enhances performance by 10% over the best prediction model, especially in the long-tailed metrics.

Even though for full hyperspectral images the best-performing methods exploit spatial-spectral information, performing classification solely on spectral information has its own advantages, e.g. smaller model size and thus less data required for training. Moreover, spectral information is complementary to spatial information and improvements on either part can be used to improve spatial-spectral approaches in the future. Recently, 1D-Justo-LiuNet was proposed as a particularly efficient model with very few parameters, which currently defines the state of the art in spectral classification. However, we show that with limited training data the model performance deteriorates. Therefore, we investigate MiniROCKET and HDC-MiniROCKET for spectral classification to mitigate that problem. The model extracts well-engineered features without trainable parameters in the feature extraction part and is therefore less vulnerable to limited training data. We show that even though MiniROCKET has more parameters it outperforms 1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and is mostly on par with it in the general case</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE CASE 2025</p></details> | None |

However, recent efforts to integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes. Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points. Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline, demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

In self-supervised monocular depth estimation frameworks, the network jointly generates and exploits depth and pose estimates during training, thereby eliminating the need for depth labels. However, these methods remain challenged by uncertainty in the input data, such as low-texture or dynamic regions, which can cause reduced depth accuracy. To address this, we introduce UM-Depth, a framework that combines motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement to enhance depth accuracy at dynamic object boundaries and in textureless regions. Specifically, we develop a teacherstudent training strategy that embeds uncertainty estimation into both the training pipeline and network architecture, thereby strengthening supervision where photometric signals are weak. Unlike prior motion-aware approaches that incur inference-time overhead and rely on additional labels or auxiliary networks for real-time generation, our method uses optical flow exclusively within the teacher network during training, which eliminating extra labeling demands and any runtime cost. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware refinement. Overall, UM-Depth achieves state-of-the-art results in both self-supervised depth and pose estimation on the KITTI datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it is non-trivial to extend the existing methods to fisheye cameras with severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences and unstable temporal dynamics, all of which significantly degrade BEV performance. To address these challenges, we propose FishBEV, a novel BEV segmentation framework specifically tailored for fisheye cameras. This framework introduces three complementary innovations, including a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale Extraction (DRME) backbone that learns robust features under distortion while preserving scale consistency, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention (U-SCA) mechanism that leverages uncertainty estimation for reliable cross-view alignment, a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention (D-TSA) module that adaptively balances near field details and far field context to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset demonstrate that FishBEV consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, regarding the performance evaluation of FishBEV on the surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

Existing depth datasets, such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. We present ROVR, a large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient depth dataset designed to capture the complexity of real-world driving. ROVR comprises 200K high-resolution frames across highway, rural, and urban scenarios, spanning day/night and adverse weather conditions. A lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures scalable collection, while sparse but statistically sufficient ground truth supports robust training. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art monocular depth models reveals severe cross-dataset generalization failures: models achieving near-ceiling accuracy on KITTI degrade drastically on ROVR, and even when trained on ROVR, current methods fall short of saturation. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by ROVR-scene diversity, dynamic environments, and sparse ground truth, establishing it as a demanding new platform for advancing depth estimation and building models with stronger real-world robustness. Extensive ablation studies provide a more intuitive understanding of our dataset across different scenarios, lighting conditions, and generalized ability.</p></details> |  | None |

The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Road Obstacle Video Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13181v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal, since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.</p></details> | GCPR 2025 | None |

| **[An Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer for Navigation in Dense, Complex Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13132v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain, high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Weakly and Self-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13116v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations, and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extension of our CVPR 2023 paper, "Weakly Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving," accepted for publication in TPAMI</p></details> | None |
| **[4DRadar-GS: Self-Supervised Dynamic Driving Scene Reconstruction with 4D Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12931v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a 4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale, generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations. Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AirBreath Sensing: Protecting Over-the-Air Distributed Sensing Against Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11267v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A distinctive function of sixth-generation (6G) networks is the integration of distributed sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) to enable intelligent perception of the physical world. This resultant platform, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to enable a broad spectrum of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, including remote surgery, autonomous driving, and holographic telepresence. Recently, the communication bottleneck confronting the implementation of an ISEA system is overcome by the development of over-the-air computing (AirComp) techniques, which facilitate simultaneous access through over-the-air data feature fusion. Despite its advantages, AirComp with uncoded transmission remains vulnerable to interference. To tackle this challenge, we propose AirBreath sensing, a spectrum-efficient framework that cascades feature compression and spread spectrum to mitigate interference without bandwidth expansion. This work reveals a fundamental tradeoff between these two operations under a fixed bandwidth constraint: increasing the compression ratio may reduce sensing accuracy but allows for more aggressive interference suppression via spread spectrum, and vice versa. This tradeoff is regulated by a key variable called breathing depth, defined as the feature subspace dimension that matches the processing gain in spread spectrum. To optimally control the breathing depth, we mathematically characterize and optimize this aforementioned tradeoff by designing a tractable surrogate for sensing accuracy, measured by classification discriminant gain (DG). Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that AirBreath sensing effectively mitigates interference in ISEA systems, and the proposed control algorithm achieves near-optimal performance as benchmarked with a brute-force search.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

Transferring its generative capabilities to modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems has also emerged as a promising direction. However, existing diffusion-based trajectory generative models often exhibit mode collapse where different random noises converge to similar trajectories after the denoising process.Therefore, state-of-the-art models often rely on anchored trajectories from pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or scene priors in the training set to mitigate collapse and enrich the diversity of generated trajectories, but such inductive bias are not available in real-world deployment, which can be challenged when generalizing to unseen scenarios. In this work, we investigate the possibility of effectively tackling the mode collapse challenge without the assumption of pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or pre-computed scene priors. Specifically, we propose TransDiffuser, an encoder-decoder based generative trajectory planning model, where the encoded scene information and motion states serve as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. Different from existing approaches, we exploit a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the denoising process to enrich the latent representation space which better guides the downstream generation. Without any predefined trajectory anchors or pre-computed scene priors, TransDiffuser achieves the PDMS of 94.85 on the closed-loop planning-oriented benchmark NAVSIM, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluation further showcases TransDiffuser generates more diverse and plausible trajectories which explore more drivable area.</p></details> | Under review | None |

One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

While recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury, ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under realistic, diverse, and controllable settings, facilitating more robust depth perception systems for autonomous vehicles.

Even this poses a serious security challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks), adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them, thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials, thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.</p></details> |  | None |

Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</p></details> |  | None |

Among various tasks in ISAC, scatter sensing plays a crucial role in exploiting the full potential of ISAC and supporting applications such as autonomous driving and low-altitude economy. However, most existing methods rely on either waveform and hardware modifications or traditional signal processing schemes, leading to poor compatibility with current communication systems and limited sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CSIYOLO, a framework that performs scatter localization only using estimated CSI from a single base station-user equipment pair. This framework comprises two main components: anchor-based scatter parameter detection and CSI-based scatter localization. First, by formulating scatter parameter extraction as an image detection problem, we propose an anchor-based scatter parameter detection method inspired by You Only Look Once architectures. After that, a CSI-based localization algorithm is derived to determine scatter locations with extracted parameters. Moreover, to improve localization accuracy and implementation efficiency, we design an extendable network structure with task-oriented optimizations, enabling multi-scale anchor detection and better adaptation to CSI characteristics. A noise injection training strategy is further designed to enhance robustness against channel estimation errors. Since the proposed framework operates solely on estimated CSI without modifying waveforms or signal processing pipelines, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing communication systems as a plugin. Experiments show that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing methods in scatter localization accuracy with relatively low complexities under varying numbers of scatters and estimation errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables.

Despite its promise, RL is susceptible to attacks designed either to compromise policy learning or to induce erroneous decisions by trained agents. Although the literature on RL security has grown rapidly and several surveys exist, existing categorizations often fall short in guiding the selection of appropriate defenses for specific systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.</p></details> |  | None |
