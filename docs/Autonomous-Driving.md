| **[DriveVLA-W0: World Models Amplify Data Scaling Law in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12796v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[On the Robustness Evaluation of 3D Obstacle Detection Against Specifications in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13653v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on real-time sensor data, such as cameras and LiDARs, for time-critical decisions using deep neural networks. The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CoIRL-AD: Collaborative-Competitive Imitation-Reinforcement Learning in Latent World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12560v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning (IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

| **[Biased-Attention Guided Risk Prediction for Safe Decision-Making at Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12428v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent decision-making framework in complex scenarios.

| **[CurriFlow: Curriculum-Guided Depth Fusion with Optical Flow-Based Temporal Alignment for 3D Semantic Scene Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12362v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion. CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PAGS: Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Driving Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12282v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost. This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects, while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AngularFuse: A Closer Look at Angle-based Perception for Spatial-Sensitive Multi-Modality Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12260v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the first time, angle-based perception was introduced into the multi-modality image fusion task</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Systems with Large Language Models: A Survey of Recent Advances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16804v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are revolutionizing transportation by reducing human intervention, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into ADSs to support high-level decision-making through their powerful reasoning, instruction-following, and communication abilities. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs leverage language-driven communication and coordination to enhance inter-agent collaboration. This paper provides a frontier survey of this emerging intersection between NLP and multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based methods based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans. Finally, we summarize key applications, datasets, and challenges to support future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoVLA: Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action Dataset for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10845v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving, particularly navigating complex and unanticipated scenarios, demands sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and data-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles. The dataset is released for academic purpose.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025, Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/covla-ad/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://turingmotors.github.io/covla-ad) |
| **[mmWave Radar-Based Non-Line-of-Sight Pedestrian Localization at T-Junctions Utilizing Road Layout Extraction via Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02348v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems. While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa) |

The COOOL benchmark targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies, and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models (VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events.

| **[Smooth Model Predictive Path Integral Control without Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09988v8)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a sampling-based control approach that can generate smooth actions for general nonlinear systems without external smoothing algorithms. Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has been utilized in numerous robotic applications due to its appealing characteristics to solve non-convex optimization problems. However, the stochastic nature of sampling-based methods can cause significant chattering in the resulting commands. Chattering becomes more prominent in cases where the environment changes rapidly, possibly even causing the MPPI to diverge. To address this issue, we propose a method that seamlessly combines MPPI with an input-lifting strategy. In addition, we introduce a new action cost to smooth control sequence during trajectory rollouts while preserving the information theoretic interpretation of MPPI, which was derived from non-affine dynamics. We validate our method in two nonlinear control tasks with neural network dynamics: a pendulum swing-up task and a challenging autonomous driving task. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the MPPI baselines with additionally applied smoothing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (and IROS 2022).

| **[Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08045v5)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  | None |

For these vehicles, as well as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics. In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICAR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant (de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering, liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows 95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from 521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h) on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Data Scaling Laws for Imitation Learning-Based End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02689v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm has recently attracted lots of attention due to its scalability. However, existing methods are constrained by the limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration of the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address this issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and behaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing imitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically, approximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were gathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We performed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400 diverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop) under stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we discovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law relationship with the amount of data, but this is not the case in closed-loop evaluation. The inconsistency between the two assessments shifts our focus toward the distribution of data rather than merely expanding its volume. (2) a small increase in the quantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the corresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to achieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions. Our results highlight the critical role of data scaling in improving the generalizability of models across diverse autonomous driving scenarios, assuring safe deployment in the real world..

| **[Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11092v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |
| **[Flow Matching-Based Autonomous Driving Planning with Advanced Interactive Behavior Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11083v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models, removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation, which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Vision-Language Cross-Attention for Real-Time Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.</p></details> | 5 pages | None |
| **[Game-Theoretic Risk-Shaped Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10960v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety, efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L) framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate, collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency.

| **[Neutral Agent-based Adversarial Policy Learning against Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-party Open Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and dependent on interactions with victim agents. To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the limited number of instances in some rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over real-world data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stability Under Scrutiny: Benchmarking Representation Paradigms for Online HD Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10660v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy, while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at https://stablehdmap.github.io/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://stablehdmap.github.io/) |

Traditionally, difficult scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually. However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition, underlining our manual specification-free definition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-based Dynamic Adaptation for Sampling-Based Motion Planning in Agile Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10567v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling-based trajectory planners are widely used for agile autonomous driving due to their ability to generate fast, smooth, and kinodynamically feasible trajectories. However, their behavior is often governed by a cost function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning for broader autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to the IEEE ICRA 2026, Vienna, Austria</p></details> | None |

Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and 66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM planners.</p></details> |  | None |

This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Risk-Budgeted Control Framework for Balanced Performance and Safety in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10442v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a risk-budgeted monitor with a control framework that certifies safety for autonomous driving. In this process, a sliding window is proposed to monitor for insufficient barrier residuals or nonzero tail risk, ensuring system safety. When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers switching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control barrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF) to address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time triggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In the FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a suboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints for the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety margin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it falls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF constraints. The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC) for autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization noise and obstacle position uncertainties. Multiple AV-pedestrian interaction scenarios are considered, with 1,500 Monte Carlo runs conducted for all scenarios. In the most challenging setting with pedestrian detection uncertainty of 5 m, the proposed framework achieves a 94-96% success rate of not colliding with the pedestrians over 300 trials while maintaining the lowest mean cross-track error (CTE = 3.2-3.6 m) to the reference path. The reduced CTE indicates faster trajectory recovery after obstacle avoidance, demonstrating a balance between safety and performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging Perspectives: Foundation Model Guided BEV Maps for 3D Object Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10287v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Hierarchical Representations of Vectorized HD Maps with Perspective Clues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11155v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The construction of vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps from onboard surround-view cameras has become a significant focus in autonomous driving. However, current map vector estimation pipelines face two key limitations: input-agnostic queries struggle to capture complex map structures, and the view transformation leads to information loss. These issues often result in inaccurate shape restoration or missing instances in map predictions. To address this concern, we propose a novel approach, namely \textbf{PerCMap}, which explicitly exploits clues from perspective-view features at both instance and point level. Specifically, at instance level, we propose Cross-view Instance Activation (CIA) to activate instance queries across surround-view images, thereby helping the model recover the instance attributes of map vectors. At point level, we design Dual-view Point Embedding (DPE), which fuses features from both views to generate input-aware positional embeddings and improve the accuracy of point coordinate estimation. Extensive experiments on \textit{nuScenes} and \textit{Argoverse 2} demonstrate that PerCMap achieves strong and consistent performance across benchmarks, reaching 67.1 and 70.5 mAP, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Beyond ADE and FDE: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Safety-Critical Prediction in Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10086v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution. Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation, contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, there has been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset. All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a computer vision conference (under review)</p></details> | None |

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally, extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench, demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across all scales and scenarios.

Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control. Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries, outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection choice.

Although calibrated physics-based and trained data-driven CFMs can replicate human driving behavior, their reliance on specific datasets limits generalization across diverse scenarios and reduces reliability in real-world deployment. Moreover, these models typically focus on behavioral fidelity and do not support the explicit optimization of local and string stability, which are increasingly important for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge-Informed Deep Learning (KIDL) paradigm that distills the generalization capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into a lightweight and stability-aware neural architecture. LLMs are used to extract fundamental car-following knowledge beyond dataset-specific patterns, and this knowledge is transferred to a reliable, tractable, and computationally efficient model through knowledge distillation. KIDL also incorporates stability constraints directly into its training objective, ensuring that the resulting model not only emulates human-like behavior but also satisfies the local and string stability requirements essential for real-world AV deployment. We evaluate KIDL on the real-world NGSIM and HighD datasets, comparing its performance with representative physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid CFMs. Both empirical and theoretical results consistently demonstrate KIDL's superior behavioral generalization and traffic flow stability, offering a robust and scalable solution for next-generation traffic systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Safer and Understandable Driver Intention Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09200v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations.

However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.</p></details> | <details><summary>We be...</summary><p>We believe that the contribution of this paper is not enough, so we integrated it into another new paper.

| **[TARO: Toward Semantically Rich Open-World Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption, limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Robust Driving Control for Autonomous Vehicles: An Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09041v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii) they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation. Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Single Domain Generalization of LiDAR-based Semantic Segmentation under Imperfect Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09035v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

| **[Scalable Offline Metrics for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08571v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work, we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13% improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2025 (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> | None |
| **[ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Approximate Domain Unlearning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08132v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g., illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code: https://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning/.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning) |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop, interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the absence of explicit depth information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g., 3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception.

With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence.

This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications, which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[A Digital Twin Framework for Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems Using Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07133v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion, our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario. The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment, we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1 score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing solution for autonomous vehicle safety.</p></details> |  | None |

State-of-the-art approaches, particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose \textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD \textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit, global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

Generation of LiDAR-Invisible Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06952v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However, existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity, and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation (Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate 3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, psychological barriers continue to impede widespread AV adoption, despite technological progress. This paper addresses the critical yet often overlooked aspect of psychological safety in AV design and operation. While traditional safety standards focus primarily on physical safety, this paper emphasizes the psychological implications that arise from human interactions with autonomous vehicles, highlighting the importance of trust and perceived risk as significant factors influencing user acceptance. The paper makes a methodological proposal, a framework for addressing AVs psychological safety consisting of three key contributions. First, it introduces a definition of psychological safety in AVs context. Secondly, it proposes a risk model for identifying and assessing AVs psychological hazards and risks. PsySIL (Psychological Safety Integrity Level), a classification of AV psychological risk levels is developed. Thirdly, an adapted system-theoretic analysis method for AVs psychological safety is proposed. The paper illustrates the application of the framework for assessing potential psychological hazards using a scenario involving a family's experience with an autonomous vehicle, pioneering a systems approach towards evaluating situations that could lead to psychological harm. By establishing a framework that incorporates psychological safety alongside physical safety, the paper contributes to the broader discourse on the safe deployment of autonomous vehicle, aiming to guide future developments in user-centred design and regulatory practices, while acknowledging the limitations brought by the application of the proposals on a rather simple but pedagogical illustrative example.</p></details> |  | None |

Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Light field and LiDAR modalities provide complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps, enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient learning for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ALISE: Annotation-Free LiDAR Instance Segmentation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05752v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth (GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Precise and Efficient Collision Prediction under Uncertainty in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05729v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research introduces two efficient methods to estimate the collision risk of planned trajectories in autonomous driving under uncertain driving conditions. Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors, and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning.

| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Automotive LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04969v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, self-supervised representation learning relying on vast amounts of unlabeled data has been explored as a pre-training method for autonomous driving. However, directly applying popular contrastive or generative methods to this problem is insufficient and may even lead to negative transfer. In this paper, we present AD-L-JEPA, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework with a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) for automotive LiDAR object detection. Unlike existing methods, AD-L-JEPA is neither generative nor contrastive. Instead of explicitly generating masked regions, our method predicts Bird's-Eye-View embeddings to capture the diverse nature of driving scenes. Furthermore, our approach eliminates the need to manually form contrastive pairs by employing explicit variance regularization to avoid representation collapse. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements on the LiDAR 3D object detection downstream task across the KITTI3D, Waymo, and ONCE datasets, while reducing GPU hours by 1.9x-2.7x and GPU memory by 2.8x-4x compared with the state-of-the-art method Occupancy-MAE. Notably, on the largest ONCE dataset, pre-training on 100K frames yields a 1.61 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 100K or 500K frames, and pre-training on 500K frames yields a 2.98 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 500K or 1M frames. AD-L-JEPA constitutes the first JEPA-based pre-training method for autonomous driving. It offers better quality, faster, and more GPU-memory-efficient self-supervised representation learning. The source code of AD-L-JEPA is ready to be released.</p></details> |  | None |

The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

However, vehicle mobility leads to spatio-temporal unpredictability of resource demands, while real-time double auctions incur significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose a look-ahead contract-based auction framework that shifts decision-making from runtime to planning time. Our approach establishes N-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and modified double auctions. The system operates in two stages: first, an LSTM-based prediction module forecasts multi-slot resource needs and determines ES roles (buyer or seller), after which a pre-double auction generates contracts specifying resource quantities, prices, and penalties. Second, these contracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions. The framework incorporates energy costs, transmission overhead, and contract breach risks into utility models, ensuring truthful, rational, and energy-efficient trading. Experiments on real-world (UTD19) and synthetic traces demonstrate that our method improves time efficiency, energy use, and social welfare compared with existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

While traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement over the previous best performing method.

Existing methods often collapse diverse driving behaviors, lack long-horizon consistency, or require task-specific engineering that limits generalization. This paper presents KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion component generates temporally coherent action sequences, while the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://perfectxu88.github.io/KDP-AD/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://perfectxu88.github.io/KDP-AD) |

Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

This lack of standardized evaluation slows progress toward safe and reliable AI for urban mobility. We introduce AutoDrive-QA, the first benchmark that systematically converts open-ended driving QA datasets (DriveLM, NuScenes-QA, LingoQA) into structured multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with distractors grounded in five realistic error categories: Driving Domain Misconceptions, Logical Inconsistencies, Misinterpreted Sensor Inputs, Computational Oversights, and Question Ambiguity. This framework enables reproducible and interpretable evaluation of VLMs across perception, prediction, and planning tasks in complex urban scenes. Experiments show that fine-tuning LLaVA-1.5-7B improves accuracy by about six percentage points across tasks, GPT-4V achieves the strongest zero-shot performance with up to 69.8% accuracy, and Qwen2-VL models also perform competitively, particularly in multi-view settings. Moreover, traditional metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr fail to distinguish strong from weak models. By providing an objective, domain-grounded evaluation protocol, AutoDrive-QA contributes to more transparent benchmarking of urban AI systems, supporting the development of safer and more trustworthy autonomous driving technologies for smart cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated results with larger dataset experiments and expanded discussion</p></details> | None |

While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance. Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in vision-language learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks. However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC) dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the SOREC dataset.

Furthermore, an independent backup loop runs concurrently to provide safe fallback trajectories when an optimal trajectory cannot be computed by the main loop within a critical time frame, thus enhancing safety and real-time performance. Our evaluation showcases the benefits of the proposed methods in various driving scenarios, highlighting the real-time applicability and robustness of our approach.

We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Large vision foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction. However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous updates, and network efficiency remains elusive. To address these challenges, we introduce GS-Share, a photorealistic map-sharing system with a compact representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update. We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively. Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission overhead by 36%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, current approaches encounter challenges due to the inability of point cloud encoders to effectively capture local details and long-range spatial relationships, as well as a significant modality gap between text and point cloud representations. To address these challenges, we present Des4Pos, a novel two-stage text-driven remote sensing localization framework. In the coarse stage, the point-cloud encoder utilizes the Multi-scale Fusion Attention Mechanism (MFAM) to enhance local geometric features, followed by a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to strengthen global spatial relationships. Concurrently, the Stepped Text Encoder (STE) integrates cross-modal prior knowledge from CLIP [1] and aligns text and point-cloud features using this prior knowledge, effectively bridging modality discrepancies. In the fine stage, we introduce a Cascaded Residual Attention (CRA) module to fuse cross-modal features and predict relative localization offsets, thereby achieving greater localization precision. Experiments on the KITTI360Pose test set demonstrate that Des4Pos achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-point-cloud place recognition. Specifically, it attains a top-1 accuracy of 40% and a top-10 accuracy of 77% under a 5-meter radius threshold, surpassing the best existing methods by 7% and 7%, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures | None |

However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication addresses these limits by enabling collaboration across vehicles and infrastructure, but it also faces heterogeneity, synchronization, and latency constraints. Language models offer strong knowledge-driven reasoning and decision-making capabilities, but they are not inherently designed to process raw sensor streams and are prone to hallucination. We propose V2X-UniPool, the first framework that unifies V2X perception with language-based reasoning for knowledge-driven AD. It transforms multimodal V2X data into structured, language-based knowledge, organizes it in a time-indexed knowledge pool for temporally consistent reasoning, and employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground decisions in real-time context. Experiments on the real-world DAIR-V2X dataset show that V2X-UniPool achieves state-of-the-art planning accuracy and safety while reducing communication cost by more than 80\%, achieving the lowest overhead among evaluated methods. These results highlight the promise of bridging V2X perception and language reasoning to advance scalable and trustworthy driving.

However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions.

| **[Calibrating the Full Predictive Class Distribution of 3D Object Detectors for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01829v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same method.</p></details> |  | None |

Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

| **[Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01545v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference, converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11 + BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for AV pipelines.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

| **[Temporal Misalignment Attacks against Multimodal Perception in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09095v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.</p></details> |  | None |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

In parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy, generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants, and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy, bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers. Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Beyond Overall Accuracy: Pose- and Occlusion-driven Fairness Analysis in Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26166v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern. In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN) alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

We propose a multi-view projection framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our method aligns LiDAR scans into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to generate large-scale synthetic 2D datasets (PC2D) in various modalities. An ensemble of 2D segmentation models is trained on these modalities, and during inference, hundreds of views per scene are processed, with logits back-projected to 3D using an occlusion-aware voting scheme to produce point-wise labels. These labels can be used directly or to fine-tune a 3D segmentation model in the target domain. We evaluate our approach in both Real-to-Real and Simulation-to-Real UDA, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Real-to-Real setting. Furthermore, we show that our framework enables segmentation of rare classes, leveraging only 2D annotations for those classes while relying on 3D annotations for others in the source domain.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data.

Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View (BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9.

| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines. Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths, this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents.

Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a broadly applicable solution for learning under uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional HD map generation is labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments. To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data, our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates, demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods typically formulate trajectory planning as a language modeling task, where physical actions are output in the language space, potentially leading to issues such as format-violating outputs, infeasible actions, and slow inference speeds. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, a novel Reinforced Cognitive framework for end-to-end autonomous Driving, unifying driving understanding and planning by integrating an autoregressive model with a diffusion planner. First, to instill human driving cognition into the VLM, we introduce a hierarchical data pipeline that mimics the sequential cognitive process of human drivers through three stages: generation, refinement, and quality control. Building on this cognitive foundation, we then address the language-action mismatch by injecting the VLM's learned driving priors into a diffusion planner to efficiently generate continuous and stable trajectories. Furthermore, to enhance driving safety and reduce collisions, we introduce a Diffusion Group Relative Policy Optimization (DiffGRPO) stage, reinforcing the planner for enhanced safety and comfort. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that ReCogDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, qualitative results across diverse driving scenarios and DriveBench highlight the model's scene comprehension. All code, model weights, and datasets will be made publicly available to facilitate subsequent research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite the perception stability in harsh environments, the point cloud generated by mmWave radar is relatively sparse while containing significant noise, which limits its further development. Traditional mmWave radar enhancement approaches often struggle to leverage the effectiveness of diffusion models in super-resolution, largely due to the unnatural range-azimuth heatmap (RAH) or bird's eye view (BEV) representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that pioneers the application of fusing range images with image diffusion models, achieving accurate and dense mmWave radar point clouds that are similar to LiDAR. Benefitting from the projection that aligns with human observation, the range image representation of mmWave radar is close to natural images, allowing the knowledge from pre-trained image diffusion models to be effectively transferred, significantly improving the overall performance. Extensive evaluations on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets demonstrate that our approach provides substantial improvements, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in generating truly three-dimensional LiDAR-like point clouds via mmWave radar. Code will be released after publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

However, their effectiveness in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next, we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs, the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.</p></details> |  | None |

Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception; however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to address the Sensor2Sensor domain gap in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of state-of-the-art CP methods and S2S-Net is conducted on the SCOPE dataset. This study shows that, all evaluated state-of-the-art mehtods for collective perception highly suffer from the Sensor2Sensor domain gap, while S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high performance in unseen sensor domains and outperforms the evaluated state-of-the-art methods by up to 44 percentage points.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\% to 7.38\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

A key component of these systems is the shared function library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process sensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical role in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored vulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based attack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven multi-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how agents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions to select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command formats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with deceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as misinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other agents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two representative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its ability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific agents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms. Our results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple toolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving systems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.</p></details> |  | None |

In complex urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing data-driven simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they suffer from inherent limitations in interpretability and generalizability--issues of critical importance in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce Symbolic Imitation Learning (SIL), a novel framework that leverages Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive explainable and generalizable driving policies from synthetic datasets. We evaluate SIL on real-world HighD and NGSim datasets, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art neural imitation learning methods using metrics such as collision rate, lane change efficiency, and average speed. The results indicate that SIL significantly enhances policy transparency while maintaining strong performance across varied driving conditions.

Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness.

Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> | None |

This survey systematically reviews four core research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception. Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models. Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment.

Existing approaches typically generate full future occupancy states from VAE-style latent encodings, which can be computationally expensive and redundant. We propose Delta-Triplane Transformers (DTT), a novel 4D OWM for autonomous driving, that introduces two key innovations: (1) a triplane based representation that encodes 3D occupancy more compactly than previous approaches, and (2) an incremental prediction strategy for OWM that models {\em changes} in occupancy rather than dealing with full states. The core insight is that changes in the compact 3D latent space are naturally sparser and easier to model, enabling higher accuracy with a lighter-weight architecture. Building on this representation, DTT extracts multi-scale motion features from historical data and iteratively predict future triplane deltas. These deltas are combined with past states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTT delivers a 1.44$\times$ speedup (26 FPS) over the state of the art, improves mean IoU to 30.85, and reduces the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.</p></details> |  | None |

Data-driven defenses such as jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding, while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100% with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications.

However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness throughout extended driving sequences.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on NavSim benchmark.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps. We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with significantly reduced computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior, known as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to deployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study comparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL), Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing. Using a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and LiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS architectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios involving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We systematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three dimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity. Our results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of real-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without compromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under which failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the underlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies. Our findings offer actionable insights into the respective strengths and limitations of each modality and outline a path toward more robust and transferable validation of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '25)</p></details> | None |

Traditional large-scale map construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions, outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods, resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen, for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1) representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3) developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset.

However, existing methods are often constrained by a passive perception paradigm, relying solely on text-based reasoning. This passivity restricts the model's capacity to actively seek crucial visual evidence when faced with uncertainty. To address this, we introduce DriveAgent-R1, the first autonomous driving agent capable of active perception for planning. In complex scenarios, DriveAgent-R1 proactively invokes tools to perform visual reasoning, firmly grounding its decisions in visual evidence, thereby enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid thinking framework, inspired by human driver cognitive patterns, allowing the agent to adaptively switch between efficient text-only reasoning and robust tool-augmented visual reasoning based on scene complexity. This capability is cultivated through a three-stage progressive training strategy, featuring a core Cascaded Reinforcement Learning (Cascaded RL) phase. Extensive experiments on the Drive-Internal dataset, which is rich in long-tail scenarios, and the public nuScenes dataset show that, with only 3B parameters, DriveAgent-R1 achieves competitive performance comparable to top closed model systems such as GPT-5 and to human driving proficiency while remaining deployment-friendly, offering a proven path toward building more intelligent autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Adaptive ICP LiDAR Odometry Based on Reliable Initial Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22058v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map, achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds. Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy of LiDAR odometry.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability.

To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by drivers of autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from drivers' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either.

However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings.

Specifically, we introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding.

In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings.

This challenge is particularly evident in autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics, where data is collected with fixed camera setups, limiting the geometric diversity. Yet, this context also presents an opportunity: the fixed relationship between the camera and the ground plane imposes additional perspective geometry constraints, enabling depth regression via vertical image positions of objects. However, this cue is highly susceptible to overfitting, thus we propose a novel canonical representation that maintains consistency across varied camera setups, effectively disentangling depth from specific parameters and enhancing generalization across datasets. We also propose a novel architecture that adaptively and probabilistically fuses depths estimated via object size and vertical image position cues. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on five autonomous driving datasets, achieving accurate metric depth estimation for varying resolutions, aspect ratios and camera setups.

Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head (i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories. Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in standard DPO.

A critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive decision-making. MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits. This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning.

On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\% and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%.

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem.

Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion) |

In this context, shared control refers to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability</p></details> | IWACIII 2025 | None |
| **[Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20196v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods. We make the code available at https://hyperspectraladapter.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Steerable Adversarial Scenario Generation through Test-Time Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20102v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator (SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving policies.

The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance metrics of 67.1 NDS and 63.1 AMOTA.

This capability, however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then, harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation, we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods rely on single-modal data sharing, limiting fusion performance, particularly in heterogeneous sensor settings involving both LiDAR and cameras across vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). To address this, we propose Radian Glue Attention (RG-Attn), a lightweight and generalizable cross-modal fusion module that unifies intra-agent and inter-agent fusion via transformation-based coordinate alignment and a unified sampling/inversion strategy. RG-Attn efficiently aligns features through a radian-based attention constraint, operating column-wise on geometrically consistent regions to reduce overhead and preserve spatial coherence, thereby enabling accurate and robust fusion. Building upon RG-Attn, we propose three cooperative architectures. The first, Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP), prioritizes communication efficiency but assumes all agents have LiDAR, optionally paired with cameras. The second, Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), offers maximal flexibility, supporting any sensor setup (e.g., LiDAR-only, camera-only, or both) and enabling strong cross-modal generalization for real-world deployment. The third, Pyramid-RG-Attn Fusion (PRGAF), aims for peak detection accuracy with the highest computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show our framework delivers state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high flexibility and efficiency.

Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation (EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intend to submit to RA-L</p></details> | None |

On the other hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents, regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |

However, LiDAR's high cost continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).</p></details> |  | None |

While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we study a data augmentation strategy that leverages the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured by the AV's sensors, as additional demonstrations. We introduce a simple vehicle-selection sampling and filtering strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer dataset for training. We evaluate this idea with a representative learning-based planner on a large real-world dataset and demonstrate improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, the approach reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10 percent of the original dataset, the method matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset. Through ablations, we analyze selection criteria and show that naive random selection can degrade performance. Our findings highlight the value of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/lyra/</p></details> | None |

Traditional rule-based localization involves many standalone modules, which is theoretically fragile and requires costly hyperparameter tuning, therefore sacrificing the accuracy and generalization. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end visual localization system, RAVE, in which the surrounding images are associated with the HD map data to estimate pose. To ensure high-quality observations for localization, a low-rank flow-based prior fusion module (FLORA) is developed to incorporate misaligned map prior into the perceived BEV features. Pursuing a balance among efficiency, interpretability, and accuracy, a hierarchical localization module is proposed, which efficiently estimates poses through a decoupled BEV neural matching-based pose solver (DEMA) using rasterized HD map, and then refines the estimation through a Transformer-based pose regressor (POET) using vectorized HD map. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can perform robust and accurate localization under varying environmental conditions while running efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios.

Real crash reports contain precisely the contrastive evidence needed, but they are hard to use: narratives are unstructured, third-person, and poorly grounded to sensor views. We address these challenges by normalizing crash narratives to ego-centric language and converting both logs and crashes into a unified scene-action representation suitable for retrieval. At decision time, our system adjudicates proposed actions by retrieving relevant precedents from this unified index; an agentic counterfactual extension proposes plausible alternatives, retrieves for each, and reasons across outcomes before deciding. On a nuScenes benchmark, precedent retrieval substantially improves calibration, with recall on contextually preferred actions rising from 24% to 53%. The counterfactual variant preserves these gains while sharpening decisions near risk.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

Built upon a multi-modal large language model foundation like Gemini, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR.

Nevertheless, its point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components: the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module. Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP. Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges such as scene understanding and effective prediction for decision-making continue to present substantial obstacles to its large-scale deployment. In this paper, we present PIE, a pioneering framework that integrates advanced perception, reasoning, and intention modeling to dynamically capture interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. It incorporates a bidirectional Mamba fusion that addresses data compression losses in multimodal fusion of camera and LiDAR inputs, alongside a novel reasoning-enhanced decoder integrating Mamba and Mixture-of-Experts to facilitate scene-compliant anchor selection and optimize adaptive trajectory inference. PIE adopts an action-motion interaction module to effectively utilize state predictions of surrounding agents to refine ego planning. The proposed framework is thoroughly validated on the NAVSIM benchmark. PIE, without using any ensemble and data augmentation techniques, achieves an 88.9 PDM score and 85.6 EPDM score, surpassing the performance of prior state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that PIE is capable of reliably generating feasible and high-quality ego trajectories.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing BEV approaches encounter significant challenges due to the large feature space, complicating efficient modeling and hindering effective integration of global attention mechanisms. We propose a novel modeling strategy, called InstanceBEV, that synergistically combines the strengths of both map-centric approaches and object-centric approaches. Our method effectively extracts instance-level features within the BEV features, facilitating the implementation of global attention modeling in a highly compressed feature space, thereby addressing the efficiency challenges inherent in map-centric global modeling. Furthermore, our approach enables effective multi-task learning without introducing additional module. We validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model through predicting occupancy, achieving 3D occupancy panoptic segmentation by combining instance information. Experimental results on the OCC3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate that InstanceBEV, utilizing only 8 frames, achieves a RayPQ of 15.3 and a RayIoU of 38.2. This surpasses SparseOcc's RayPQ by 9.3% and RayIoU by 10.7%, showcasing the effectiveness of multi-task synergy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spatial Envelope MPC: High Performance Driving without a Reference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18506v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel envelope based model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to enable autonomous vehicles to handle high performance driving across a wide range of scenarios without a predefined reference. In high performance autonomous driving, safe operation at the vehicle's dynamic limits requires a real time planning and control framework capable of accounting for key vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints when following a predefined reference trajectory is suboptimal or even infeasible. State of the art planning and control frameworks, however, are predominantly reference based, which limits their performance in such situations. To address this gap, this work first introduces a computationally efficient vehicle dynamics model tailored for optimization based control and a continuously differentiable mathematical formulation that accurately captures the entire drivable envelope. This novel model and formulation allow for the direct integration of dynamic feasibility and safety constraints into a unified planning and control framework, thereby removing the necessity for predefined references. The challenge of envelope planning, which refers to maximally approximating the safe drivable area, is tackled by combining reinforcement learning with optimization techniques. The framework is validated through both simulations and real world experiments, demonstrating its high performance across a variety of tasks, including racing, emergency collision avoidance and off road navigation. These results highlight the framework's scalability and broad applicability across a diverse set of scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, TRFC cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions, and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution by the first three authors</p></details> | None |

Yet, deploying LLM-driven planning in the physical world demands strict adherence to safety and regulatory constraints, which current models often violate due to hallucination or weak alignment. Traditional data-driven alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), require costly human labeling, while recent formal-feedback approaches still depend on resource-intensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose LAD-VF, a fine-tuning-free framework that leverages formal verification feedback for automated prompt engineering. By introducing a formal-verification-informed text loss integrated with LLM-AutoDiff, LAD-VF iteratively refines prompts rather than model parameters. This yields three key benefits: (i) scalable adaptation without fine-tuning; (ii) compatibility with modular LLM architectures; and (iii) interpretable refinement via auditable prompts. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that LAD-VF substantially enhances specification compliance, improving success rates from 60% to over 90%. Our method thus presents a scalable and interpretable pathway toward trustworthy, formally-verified LLM-driven control systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in cooperative perception, prediction, and planning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, mainstream methods trained via imitation learning suffer from critical safety limitations, as they fail to distinguish between trajectories that appear human-like but are potentially unsafe. Some recent approaches attempt to address this by regressing multiple rule-driven scores but decoupling supervision from policy optimization, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose DriveDPO, a Safety Direct Preference Optimization Policy Learning framework. First, we distill a unified policy distribution from human imitation similarity and rule-based safety scores for direct policy optimization. Further, we introduce an iterative Direct Preference Optimization stage formulated as trajectory-level preference alignment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that DriveDPO achieves a new state-of-the-art PDMS of 90.0. Furthermore, qualitative results across diverse challenging scenarios highlight DriveDPO's ability to produce safer and more reliable driving behaviors.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing collaborative perception frameworks often assume ample communication resources, which is usually impractical in real-world vehicular networks. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the problem of communication resource allocation for collaborative perception and proposes RACooper, a novel RSU-assisted resource allocation framework that maximizes perception accuracy under constrained communication resources. RACooper leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning model to dynamically allocate communication resources while accounting for real-time sensing data and channel dynamics induced by vehicular mobility. By jointly optimizing spatial confidence metrics and channel state information, our approach ensures efficient feature transmission, enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative perception. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to conventional baseline algorithms, RACooper achieves significant improvements in perception accuracy, especially under bandwidth-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method, termed TrifocalCalib, significantly improves accuracy and robustness compared to both recent learning-based and classical approaches. Unlike many existing techniques, our approach requires no calibration target, imposes no constraints on camera motion, and simultaneously estimates both focal length and principal point.

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of real-time, non-intrusive drowsiness detection methods, focusing on computer vision based YOLO (You Look Only Once) algorithms. A publicly available dataset namely, UTA-RLDD was used, containing both awake and drowsy conditions, ensuring variability in gender, eyewear, illumination, and skin tone.

While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline. These findings demonstrate the practical advantages of a physics-informed and feature-rich machine learning framework for real-time lane-change intention prediction in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoPlanner: An Interactive Motion Planner with Contingency-Aware Diffusion for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17080v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction and motion planning are crucial for autonomous driving systems to navigate safely in complex, interactive environments characterized by multimodal uncertainties. However, current generation-then-evaluation frameworks typically construct multiple plausible trajectory hypotheses but ultimately adopt a single most likely outcome, leading to overconfident decisions and a lack of fallback strategies that are vital for safety in rare but critical scenarios. Moreover, the usual decoupling of prediction and planning modules could result in socially inconsistent or unrealistic joint trajectories, especially in highly interactive traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a contingency-aware diffusion planner (CoPlanner), a unified framework that jointly models multi-agent interactive trajectory generation and contingency-aware motion planning. Specifically, the pivot-conditioned diffusion mechanism anchors trajectory sampling on a validated, shared short-term segment to preserve temporal consistency, while stochastically generating diverse long-horizon branches that capture multimodal motion evolutions. In parallel, we design a contingency-aware multi-scenario scoring strategy that evaluates candidate ego trajectories across multiple plausible long-horizon evolution scenarios, balancing safety, progress, and comfort. This integrated design preserves feasible fallback options and enhances robustness under uncertainty, leading to more realistic interaction-aware planning. Extensive closed-loop experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that CoPlanner consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both Val14 and Test14 datasets, achieving significant improvements in safety and comfort under both reactive and non-reactive settings. Code and model will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a critical bottleneck lies in the manual engineering of reward functions and training curricula for complex and dynamic driving tasks, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose OGR (Orchestrate, Generate, Reflect), a novel automated driving policy learning framework that leverages vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent collaboration. Our framework capitalizes on advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding capabilities of VLMs to construct a hierarchical agent system. Specifically, a centralized orchestrator plans high-level training objectives, while a generation module employs a two-step analyze-then-generate process for efficient generation of reward-curriculum pairs. A reflection module then facilitates iterative optimization based on the online evaluation. Furthermore, a dedicated memory module endows the VLM agents with the capabilities of long-term memory. To enhance robustness and diversity of the generation process, we introduce a parallel generation scheme and a human-in-the-loop technique for augmentation of the reward observation space. Through efficient multi-agent cooperation and leveraging rich multimodal information, OGR enables the online evolution of reinforcement learning policies to acquire interaction-aware driving skills. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the superior performance, robust generalizability across distinct urban scenarios, and strong compatibility with various RL algorithms. Further real-world experiments highlight the practical viability and effectiveness of our framework. The source code will be available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |

Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel group-relative RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative formulation and employs a surrogate objective for stable optimization, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
