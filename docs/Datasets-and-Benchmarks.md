| **[MathCanvas: Intrinsic Visual Chain-of-Thought for Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14958v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity, strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing. Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mathcanvas.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mathcanvas.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[LiFMCR: Dataset and Benchmark for Light Field Multi-Camera Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13729v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth, LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF) poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods. As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust 3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view light field processing.

| **[MSEarth: A Multimodal Scientific Dataset and Benchmark for Phenomena Uncovering in Earth Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20740v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has unlocked new opportunities to tackle complex scientific challenges. Despite this progress, their application in addressing earth science problems, especially at the graduate level, remains underexplored. A significant barrier is the absence of benchmarks that capture the depth and contextual complexity of geoscientific reasoning. Current benchmarks often rely on synthetic datasets or simplistic figure-caption pairs, which do not adequately reflect the intricate reasoning and domain-specific insights required for real-world scientific applications. To address these gaps, we introduce MSEarth, a multimodal scientific benchmark curated from high-quality, open-access scientific publications. MSEarth encompasses the five major spheres of Earth science: atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, featuring over 289K figures with refined captions. These captions are crafted from the original figure captions and enriched with discussions and reasoning from the papers, ensuring the benchmark captures the nuanced reasoning and knowledge-intensive content essential for advanced scientific tasks. MSEarth supports a variety of tasks, including scientific figure captioning, multiple choice questions, and open-ended reasoning challenges. By bridging the gap in graduate-level benchmarks, MSEarth provides a scalable and high-fidelity resource to enhance the development and evaluation of MLLMs in scientific reasoning. The benchmark is publicly available to foster further research and innovation in this field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CurLL: A Developmental Framework to Evaluate Continual Learning in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13008v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL) grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages 5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity, comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA), and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer, and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances continual learning evaluations for language models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CodePlot-CoT: Mathematical Visual Reasoning by Thinking with Code-Driven Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11718v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance, such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems. Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples. Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT) |
| **[ViDRiP-LLaVA: A Dataset and Benchmark for Diagnostic Reasoning from Pathology Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04192v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ViDRiP-LLaVA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) in computational pathology that integrates three distinct image scenarios, including single patch images, automatically segmented pathology video clips, and manually segmented pathology videos. This integration closely mirrors the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, ViDRiP-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning. Central to our approach is the ViDRiP-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. ViDRiP-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning. Our code, data, and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/QuIIL/ViDRiP-LLaVA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/QuIIL/ViDRiP-LLaVA) |
| **[Automatic Speech Recognition in the Modern Era: Architectures, Training, and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12827v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has undergone a profound transformation over the past decade, driven by advances in deep learning. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the modern era of ASR, charting its evolution from traditional hybrid systems, such as Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Models (GMM-HMMs) and Deep Neural Network-HMMs (DNN-HMMs), to the now-dominant end-to-end neural architectures. We systematically review the foundational end-to-end paradigms: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), attention-based encoder-decoder models, and the Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T), which established the groundwork for fully integrated speech-to-text systems. We then detail the subsequent architectural shift towards Transformer and Conformer models, which leverage self-attention to capture long-range dependencies with high computational efficiency. A central theme of this survey is the parallel revolution in training paradigms. We examine the progression from fully supervised learning, augmented by techniques like SpecAugment, to the rise of self-supervised learning (SSL) with foundation models such as wav2vec 2.0, which drastically reduce the reliance on transcribed data. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of largescale, weakly supervised models like Whisper, which achieve unprecedented robustness through massive data diversity. The paper also covers essential ecosystem components, including key datasets and benchmarks (e.g., LibriSpeech, Switchboard, CHiME), standard evaluation metrics (e.g., Word Error Rate), and critical considerations for real-world deployment, such as streaming inference, on-device efficiency, and the ethical imperatives of fairness and robustness. We conclude by outlining open challenges and future research directions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ImmerIris: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Immersive Iris Recognition in Open Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10113v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion, intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture. Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets, containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment. Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust immersive recognition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Humanoid Everyday: A Comprehensive Robotic Dataset for Open-World Humanoid Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08807v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From loco-motion to dextrous manipulation, humanoid robots have made remarkable strides in demonstrating complex full-body capabilities. However, the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction, locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are made publicly available on our project website.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmark It Yourself (BIY): Preparing a Dataset and Benchmarking AI Models for Scatterplot-Related Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06071v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash, especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%). Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly.

| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation: A Survey with Focus on Repository-Level Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04905v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved automated code generation. While function-level and file-level generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an emphasis on repository-level approaches. We categorize existing work along several dimensions, including generation strategies, retrieval modalities, model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we summarize widely used datasets and benchmarks, analyze current limitations, and outline key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our goal is to establish a unified analytical framework for understanding this rapidly evolving field and to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software engineering.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Amelia: A Large Dataset and Benchmark for Airport Surface Movement Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21185v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand for air travel is rising, straining existing aviation infrastructure. In the US, more than 90% of airport control towers are understaffed, falling short of FAA and union standards. This, in part, has contributed to an uptick in near-misses and safety-critical events, highlighting the need for advancements in air traffic management technologies to ensure safe and efficient operations. Data-driven predictive models for terminal airspace show potential to address these challenges; however, the lack of large-scale surface movement datasets in the public domain has hindered the development of scalable and generalizable approaches. To address this, we introduce Amelia-42, a first-of-its-kind large collection of raw airport surface movement reports streamed through the FAA's System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Program, comprising over two years of trajectory data (~9.19 TB) across 42 US airports. We open-source tools to process this data into clean tabular position reports. We release Amelia42-Mini, a 15-day sample per airport, fully processed data on HuggingFace for ease of use. We also present a trajectory forecasting benchmark consisting of Amelia10-Bench, an accessible experiment family using 292 days from 10 airports, as well as Amelia-TF, a transformer-based baseline for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. All resources are available at our website: https://ameliacmu.github.io and https://huggingface.co/AmeliaCMU.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 19 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Bias beyond Borders: Global Inequalities in AI-Generated Music](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01963v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent years have seen remarkable progress in music generation models, research on their biases across countries, languages, cultures, and musical genres remains underexplored. This gap is compounded by the lack of datasets and benchmarks that capture the global diversity of music. To address these challenges, we introduce GlobalDISCO, a large-scale dataset consisting of 73k music tracks generated by state-of-the-art commercial generative music models, along with paired links to 93k reference tracks in LAION-DISCO-12M. The dataset spans 147 languages and includes musical style prompts extracted from MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The dataset is globally balanced, representing musical styles from artists across 79 countries and five continents. Our evaluation reveals large disparities in music quality and alignment with reference music between high-resource and low-resource regions. Furthermore, we find marked differences in model performance between mainstream and geographically niche genres, including cases where models generate music for regional genres that more closely align with the distribution of mainstream styles.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rapid training of Hamiltonian graph networks using random features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06558v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring and molecular systems in up to 3 dimensions and 10,000 particles with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. Our proposed approach is benchmarked using a NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track publication to further demonstrate its versatility. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, and an appendix</p></details> | None |
| **[Benchmarking Egocentric Visual-Inertial SLAM at City Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26639v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift, academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors. We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale. This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at https://www.lamaria.ethz.ch.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |
| **[LMOD+: A Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset and Benchmark for Developing and Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models in Ophthalmology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25620v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging, anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity classification with international grading standards, and demographic prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved ~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of vision-threatening diseases.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Toward a Vision-Language Foundation Model for Medical Data: Multimodal Dataset and Benchmarks for Vietnamese PET/CT Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24739v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, their focus on pairwise relationships restricts their ability to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this issue, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite the proposal of numerous HNNs, the absence of consistent experimental protocols and multi-dimensional empirical analysis impedes deeper understanding and further development of HNN research. While several toolkits for deep hypergraph learning (DHGL) have been introduced to facilitate algorithm evaluation, they provide only limited quantitative evaluation results and insufficient coverage of advanced algorithms, datasets, and benchmark tasks. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for HNNs. Specifically, DHG-Bench systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. We comprehensively evaluate 17 state-of-the-art HNN algorithms on 22 diverse datasets spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, under unified experimental settings. Extensive experiments reveal both the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions for future research. Furthermore, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. The DHG-Bench library is available at: https://github.com/Coco-Hut/DHG-Bench.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Coco-Hut/DHG-Bench) |

However, researchers often face substantial difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values, consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and (3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice, we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications for the alignment of machine behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures and tables, EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> | None |

Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction, hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development. We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues. When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases, indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers & practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases, enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[RAM-W1K: A Multi-Task Wrist Dataset and Benchmark for Rheumatoid Arthritis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05193v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis, which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii) Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 1048 wrist conventional radiographs of 388 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level instance segmentation annotations for 618 images and SvdH BE scores for 800 images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte detection.

| **[Detecting Token-Level Hallucinations Using Variance Signals: A Reference-Free Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04137v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations, confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Biology-Instructions: A Dataset and Benchmark for Multi-Omics Sequence Understanding Capability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19191v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains, but their application to multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset for multi-omics biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules. This dataset bridges LLMs and complex biological sequence-related tasks, enhancing their versatility and reasoning while maintaining conversational fluency. We also highlight significant limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs on multi-omics tasks without specialized training. To overcome this, we propose ChatMultiOmics, a strong baseline with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating superior biological understanding through Biology-Instructions. Both resources are publicly available, paving the way for better integration of LLMs in multi-omics analysis.

| **[Autonomous Data Agents: A New Opportunity for Smart Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18710v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming, and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale. Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises: how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations? Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks, reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools, DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection, transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems, safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.</p></details> |  | None |

The main challenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait, accurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal consistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity preservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion with two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion signals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and reduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both expression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully preserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports controllable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including real faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based frameworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable animation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address this, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term animation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless acceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality results efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible. Finally, we introduce EmojiBench++, a more comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse portraits, driving videos, and landmark sequences. Extensive evaluations on EmojiBench++ demonstrate that Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster achieves superior performance in both animation quality and controllability.

This includes video cropped to the vocal tract region, sentence-level splits of the data, restored and denoised audio, and regions-of-interest timeseries.

Framing bias detection as sentence-level classification obscures which words carry bias and what type is present, limiting both auditability and targeted mitigation. We introduce the GUS-Net Framework, comprising the GUS dataset and a multi-label token-level detector for span-level analysis of social bias. The GUS dataset contains 3,739 unique snippets across multiple domains, with over 69,000 token-level annotations. Each token is labeled using BIO tags (Begin, Inside, Outside) for three pathways of representational harm: Generalizations, Unfairness, and Stereotypes. To ensure reliable data annotation, we employ an automated multi-agent pipeline that proposes candidate spans which are subsequently verified and corrected by human experts. We formulate bias detection as multi-label token-level classification and benchmark both encoder-based models (e.g., BERT family variants) and decoder-based large language models (LLMs). Our evaluations cover token-level identification and span-level entity recognition on our test set, and out-of-distribution generalization. Empirical results show that encoder-based models consistently outperform decoder-based baselines on nuanced and overlapping spans while being more computationally efficient. The framework delivers interpretable, fine-grained diagnostics that enable systematic auditing and mitigation of representational harms in real-world NLP systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld) |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for molecule-text alignment are predominantly built on a one-to-one mapping, measuring LLMs' ability to retrieve a single, pre-defined answer, rather than their creative potential to generate diverse, yet equally valid, molecular candidates. To address this critical gap, we propose Speak-to-Structure (S^2-Bench}), the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs in open-domain natural language-driven molecule generation. S^2-Bench is specifically designed for one-to-many relationships, challenging LLMs to demonstrate genuine molecular understanding and generation capabilities. Our benchmark includes three key tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom), each probing a different aspect of molecule discovery. We also introduce OpenMolIns, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset that enables Llama-3.1-8B to surpass the most powerful LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on S^2-Bench. Our comprehensive evaluation of 28 LLMs shifts the focus from simple pattern recall to realistic molecular design, paving the way for more capable LLMs in natural language-driven molecule discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our codes and datasets are available through https://github.com/phenixace/TOMG-Bench</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/phenixace/TOMG-Bench) |

Some of the many questions users pose may signal confusion, misuse, or even the early warning signs of a developing health crisis. Detecting these critical questions that may precede severe adverse events or life-threatening complications is vital for timely intervention and improving patient safety. This study introduces a novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions extracted from online forums. Each entry is manually labelled for criticality based on clinical risk factors. We benchmark the performance of six traditional machine learning classifiers using TF-IDF textual representations, alongside three state-of-the-art large language model (LLM)-based classification approaches that leverage deep contextual understanding. Our results highlight the potential of classical and modern methods to support real-time triage and alert systems in digital health spaces. The curated dataset is made publicly available to encourage further research at the intersection of patient-generated data, natural language processing, and early warning systems for critical health events.

It enables robots to interact with the environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets. This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 19 figures, 2 tables.

However, a persistent challenge is the prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws, which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

To enable safe and responsive assistance, robots require accurate human motion prediction in physical interaction scenarios. However, this remains a challenging task due to the variability of assistive settings and the complexity of coupled dynamics in physical interactions. In this work, we address these challenges through two key contributions: (1) HHI-Assist, a dataset comprising motion capture clips of human-human interactions in assistive tasks; and (2) a conditional Transformer-based denoising diffusion model for predicting the poses of interacting agents. Our model effectively captures the coupled dynamics between caregivers and care receivers, demonstrating improvements over baselines and strong generalization to unseen scenarios. By advancing interaction-aware motion prediction and introducing a new dataset, our work has the potential to significantly enhance robotic assistance policies.

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored. In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with 1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types, including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering, and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a 24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field.

The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems.

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs.

However, existing control software for industrial equipment, typically reliant on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that require human interactions such as mouse clicks or screen touches, poses significant barriers to the adoption of code-based equipment automation. Recently, Large Language Model-based General Computer Control (LLM-GCC) has emerged as a promising approach to automate GUI-based operations. However, industrial settings pose unique challenges, including visually diverse, domain-specific interfaces and mission-critical tasks demanding high precision. This paper introduces IndusGCC, the first dataset and benchmark tailored to LLM-GCC in industrial environments, encompassing 448 real-world tasks across seven domains, from robotic arm control to production line configuration. IndusGCC features multimodal human interaction data with the equipment software, providing robust supervision for GUI-level code generation. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation framework with functional and structural metrics to assess LLM-generated control scripts. Experimental results on mainstream LLMs demonstrate both the potential of LLM-GCC and the challenges it faces, establishing a strong foundation for future research toward fully automated factories.

However, their general-purpose nature often limits their effectiveness in domain-specific applications that require specialized knowledge, such as healthcare, chemistry, or legal analysis. To address this, researchers have explored diverse methods to enhance LLMs by integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of these methods, which we categorize into four key approaches: dynamic knowledge injection, static knowledge embedding, modular adapters, and prompt optimization. Each approach offers unique mechanisms to equip LLMs with domain expertise, balancing trade-offs between flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. We discuss how these methods enable LLMs to tackle specialized tasks, compare their advantages and disadvantages, evaluate domain-specific LLMs against general LLMs, and highlight the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field. For those interested in delving deeper into this area, we also summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks.

However, these models often infer and reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight, and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2) implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes, highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA, and the source code is available at https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git) |

The MahaSTS dataset consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5 range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations, targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings.

To address this challenge, text-rich Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have emerged for high-resource languages like English. However, a critical gap persists for low-resource languages such as Korean, where the lack of comprehensive benchmarks hinders robust model evaluation and comparison. To bridge this gap, we introduce KRETA, a benchmark for Korean Reading and rEasoning in Text-rich VQA Attuned to diverse visual contexts. KRETA facilitates an in-depth evaluation of both visual text understanding and reasoning capabilities, while also supporting a multifaceted assessment across 15 domains and 26 image types. Additionally, we introduce a semi-automated VQA generation pipeline specifically optimized for text-rich settings, leveraging refined stepwise image decomposition and a rigorous seven-metric evaluation protocol to ensure data quality. While KRETA is tailored for Korean, we hope our adaptable and extensible pipeline will facilitate the development of similar benchmarks in other languages, thereby accelerating multilingual VLM research.

To address this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition, utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches. Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34 garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our benchmark, dataset and competition results can serve as a foundation for future benchmarks and drive further progress in data-driven robotic cloth manipulation.

Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> | None |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

However, existing AVE datasets are primarily limited to text-to-text or image-to-text settings, lacking support for product videos, diverse attribute coverage, and public availability. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text e-commerce AVE dataset across 14 different domains and covering 172 unique attributes. To ensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs, resulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data. In order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings, and there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging effective temporal information.

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information. Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless, this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring sophisticated machine learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset is available at HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/datasets/bandeiralab/Pep2Prob</p></details> | None |

However, these 3DGS generative compression techniques introduce unique distortions lacking systematic quality assessment research. To this end, we establish 3DGS-VBench, a large-scale Video Quality Assessment (VQA) Dataset and Benchmark with 660 compressed 3DGS models and video sequences generated from 11 scenes across 6 SOTA 3DGS compression algorithms with systematically designed parameter levels. With annotations from 50 participants, we obtained MOS scores with outlier removal and validated dataset reliability. We benchmark 6 3DGS compression algorithms on storage efficiency and visual quality, and evaluate 15 quality assessment metrics across multiple paradigms. Our work enables specialized VQA model training for 3DGS, serving as a catalyst for compression and quality assessment research.

We introduce SE-VAE (Structural Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is essential.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures | None |

LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments.

However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts. Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis.

The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes.

However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities: visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral, and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories, instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing research primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing. Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style consistency and role coherence.

Building a high quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships, providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues. Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity, semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance, highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-powered Agents.

However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships.

However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> | [Code Link](https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d) |
| **[Identifying Prompted Artist Names from Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18633v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition: predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone. The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity, multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks. Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging. Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the dataset and benchmark to foster further research: https://graceduansu.github.io/IdentifyingPromptedArtists/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://graceduansu.github.io/IdentifyingPromptedArtists</p></details> | [Code Link](https://graceduansu.github.io/IdentifyingPromptedArtists) |

Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road safety assessments are critical yet costly, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where most roads remain unrated. Traditional methods require expert annotation and training data, while supervised learning-based approaches struggle to generalise across regions. In this paper, we introduce \textit{V-RoAst}, a zero-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to classify road safety attributes defined by the iRAP standard. We introduce the first open-source dataset from ThaiRAP, consisting of over 2,000 curated street-level images from Thailand annotated for this task. We evaluate Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini on this dataset and benchmark their performance against VGGNet and ResNet baselines. While VLMs underperform on spatial awareness, they generalise well to unseen classes and offer flexible prompt-based reasoning without retraining. Our results show that VLMs can serve as automatic road assessment tools when integrated with complementary data. This work is the first to explore VLMs for zero-shot infrastructure risk assessment and opens new directions for automatic, low-cost road safety mapping.

| **[FantasyPortrait: Enhancing Multi-Character Portrait Animation with Expression-Augmented Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12956v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts.

To address this gap, we present the AnyCap Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities, 28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RadioDiff-3D: A 3D$\times$3D Radio Map Dataset and Generative Diffusion Based Benchmark for 6G Environment-Aware Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12166v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA, forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich, high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D environment-aware communication.

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

While machine learning has been effective in real-time detection of phishing attacks, progress is hindered by lack of large, high-quality datasets and benchmarks. In addition to poor-quality due to challenges in data collection, existing datasets suffer from leakage and unrealistic base rates, leading to overly optimistic performance results. In this paper, we introduce PhreshPhish, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of phishing websites that addresses these limitations. Compared to existing public datasets, PhreshPhish is substantially larger and provides significantly higher quality, as measured by the estimated rate of invalid or mislabeled data points. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets specifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage, increasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base rates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple solution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets. We believe the availability of this dataset and benchmarks will enable realistic, standardized model comparison and foster further advances in phishing detection.

| **[ProGait: A Multi-Purpose Video Dataset and Benchmark for Transfemoral Prosthesis Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10223v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset. We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models, demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for prosthesis-specific tasks.

| **[From Wardrobe to Canvas: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA for Part-level Controllable Human Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10217v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images. However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity, clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and identity-preserving full-body synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures | None |

This challenge is compounded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality medical imaging retrieval datasets and benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that leverages dense radiology reports to define image-wise similarity ordering at multiple granularities in a scalable and fully automatic manner. Using this approach, we construct two comprehensive medical imaging retrieval datasets: MIMIC-IR for Chest X-rays and CTRATE-IR for CT scans, providing detailed image-image ranking annotations conditioned on diverse anatomical structures. Furthermore, we develop two retrieval systems, RadIR-CXR and model-ChestCT, which demonstrate superior performance in traditional image-image and image-report retrieval tasks. These systems also enable flexible, effective image retrieval conditioned on specific anatomical structures described in text, achieving state-of-the-art results on 77 out of 78 metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences. Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.</p></details> |  | None |

This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.</p></details> |  | None |

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively). It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%). Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6).</p></details> |  | None |

Exploring Visual Correspondence Shortcomings of Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04670v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have shown a strong ability in visual perception, reasoning abilities, and vision-language understanding. However, the visual matching ability of MLLMs is rarely studied, despite finding the visual correspondence of objects is essential in computer vision. Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent MLLMs still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o. In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs. The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. We categorize the data samples of MMVM benchmark into eight aspects based on the required cues and capabilities to more comprehensively evaluate and analyze current MLLMs. In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation. To our knowledge, this is the first visual corresponding dataset and benchmark for the MLLM community. Finally, we present CoLVA, a novel contrastive MLLM with two novel technical designs: fine-grained vision expert with object-level contrastive learning and instruction augmentation strategy. The former learns instance discriminative tokens, while the latter further improves instruction following ability. CoLVA-InternVL2-4B achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 49.80\% on the MMVM benchmark, surpassing GPT-4o and the best open-source MLLM, Qwen2VL-72B, by 7.15\% and 11.72\% OA, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MMVM SFT dataset and our novel technical designs.

State-of-the-art research in LLM-aided design has demonstrated the ability of LLMs to generate syntactically correct RTL code, showcasing encouraging prospects for integrating AI into the hardware design process. A key enabler of these advancements is the availability of high-quality benchmarks to evaluate new approaches. However, existing datasets and benchmarks fall short of system-level design, as they focus primarily on component-level information and low-complexity designs. To address this gap, we introduce the System-Level Design Benchmark (SLDB), a dataset tailored for evaluating LLMs in system-level integration and configuration tasks. SLDB includes a curated benchmark suite of 10 baseline SoC designs, whose components can be combined into an exponential number of distinct tile-based SoCs through a synthetic library. The dataset provides full SoC configurations, accelerator integration code, communication parameters, and accelerator-aware system configurations, along with testing-application code, compatible with the ESP platform[1].</p></details> |  | None |

In clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis, which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii) Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional radiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level instance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548 images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within the RA-related domain.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional frame interpolation tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI, carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/hyj542682306/Semantic-Frame-Interpolation</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/hyj542682306/Semantic-Frame-Interpolation) |

However, running these models at sufficient resolution for local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example, data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep neural networks have the potential to identify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public datasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains \textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496 patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from 2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients. It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification of ovarian tumors. In our comprehensive experiments, the proposed method exhibited satisfactory performance, achieving accuracies exceeding 90\% on the two most common pathological types of ovarian tumor and an overall performance of 85\%.

We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Are Synthetic Videos Useful? A Benchmark for Retrieval-Centric Evaluation of Synthetic Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02316v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions: Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that measurably improve TVR outcomes.

| **[Context-Aware Academic Emotion Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00586v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic emotion analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating students' engagement and cognitive states during the learning process. This paper addresses the challenge of automatically recognizing academic emotions through facial expressions in real-world learning environments. While significant progress has been made in facial expression recognition for basic emotions, academic emotion recognition remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of publicly available datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAER, a novel dataset comprising approximately 2,700 video clips collected from around 140 students in diverse, natural learning contexts such as classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and dormitories, covering both classroom sessions and individual study. Each clip was annotated independently by approximately ten annotators using two distinct sets of academic emotion labels with varying granularity, enhancing annotation consistency and reliability. To our knowledge, RAER is the first dataset capturing diverse natural learning scenarios. Observing that annotators naturally consider context cues-such as whether a student is looking at a phone or reading a book-alongside facial expressions, we propose CLIP-CAER (CLIP-based Context-aware Academic Emotion Recognition). Our method utilizes learnable text prompts within the vision-language model CLIP to effectively integrate facial expression and context cues from videos. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIP-CAER substantially outperforms state-of-the-art video-based facial expression recognition methods, which are primarily designed for basic emotions, emphasizing the crucial role of context in accurately recognizing academic emotions.

| **[Box-QAymo: Box-Referring VQA Dataset for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00525v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3) spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate effectively with users under real-world conditions.

Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles.

Traditional saliency-aware cropping methods optimize a single bounding box, making them ineffective for applications requiring multiple disjoint crops. In this work, we extend the Fixed Aspect Ratio Cropping algorithm to efficiently extract multiple non-overlapping crops in linear time. Our approach dynamically adjusts attention thresholds and removes selected crops from consideration without recomputing the entire saliency map.

Applications, Challenges, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13310v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming much of software development, yet its application in software architecture is still in its infancy, and no prior study has systematically addressed the topic. Aim: We aim to systematically synthesize the use, rationale, contexts, usability, and future challenges of GenAI in software architecture. Method: We performed a multivocal literature review (MLR), analyzing peer-reviewed and gray literature, identifying current practices, models, adoption contexts, and reported challenges, extracting themes via open coding. Results: Our review identified significant adoption of GenAI for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. OpenAI GPT models are predominantly applied, and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieved-augmented generation (RAG). GenAI has been applied mostly to initial stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the dominant targets. However, rigorous testing of GenAI outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks. Conclusions: GenAI shows significant potential in software design, but several challenges remain on its path to greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architecture-specific datasets and benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical possibilities and practical use.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120 instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA, which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering 158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using USIS16K.

Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical Machine Learning and other Deep Learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.15299</p></details> | None |

To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings.

We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks.

Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> | None |

However, real-world socioeconomic datasets are typically subject to strict data protection protocols, which often prohibit public sharing, even for synthetic derivatives. This severely limits the reproducibility and accessibility of benchmark studies in such settings. Further, there are very few publicly available synthetic datasets. Thus, there is limited availability of benchmarks for systematic evaluation of imputation methods on socioeconomic datasets, whether real or synthetic. In this study, we utilize the World Bank's publicly available synthetic dataset, Synthetic Data for an Imaginary Country, which closely mimics a real World Bank household survey while being fully public, enabling broad access for methodological research. With this as a starting point, we derived the IMAGIC-500 dataset: we select a subset of 500k individuals across approximately 100k households with 19 socioeconomic features, designed to reflect the hierarchical structure of real-world household surveys. This paper introduces a comprehensive missing data imputation benchmark on IMAGIC-500 under various missing mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and missingness ratios (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%). Our evaluation considers the imputation accuracy for continuous and categorical variables, computational efficiency, and impact on downstream predictive tasks, such as estimating educational attainment at the individual level. The results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of statistical, traditional machine learning, and deep learning imputation techniques, including recent diffusion-based methods. The IMAGIC-500 dataset and benchmark aim to facilitate the development of robust imputation algorithms and foster reproducible social science research.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project website:https://video-cot.github.io/ .</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet, including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and BigEarthNet-L.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.5 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operating temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in various neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains.

Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore, the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, limited by existing datasets, previous works mainly focus on understanding object properties or inter-object spatial relationships in a 3D scene. To tackle this problem, this paper builds the first largest ever multi-modal 3D scene dataset and benchmark with hierarchical grounded language annotations, MMScan. It is constructed based on a top-down logic, from region to object level, from a single target to inter-target relationships, covering holistic aspects of spatial and attribute understanding. The overall pipeline incorporates powerful VLMs via carefully designed prompts to initialize the annotations efficiently and further involve humans' correction in the loop to ensure the annotations are natural, correct, and comprehensive. Built upon existing 3D scanning data, the resulting multi-modal 3D dataset encompasses 1.4M meta-annotated captions on 109k objects and 7.7k regions as well as over 3.04M diverse samples for 3D visual grounding and question-answering benchmarks. We evaluate representative baselines on our benchmarks, analyze their capabilities in different aspects, and showcase the key problems to be addressed in the future. Furthermore, we use this high-quality dataset to train state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding and LLMs and obtain remarkable performance improvement both on existing benchmarks and in-the-wild evaluation.

However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios, which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness, truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe deployment of these models in real-world applications.</p></details> | 21 pages, preprint | None |

Lately, the use of synthetic data to complement or replace genuine data for the training of face recognition models has been proposed. While promising results have been obtained, it still remains unclear if generative models can yield diverse enough data for such tasks. In this work, we introduce a new method, inspired by the physical motion of soft particles subjected to stochastic Brownian forces, allowing us to sample identities distributions in a latent space under various constraints. We introduce three complementary algorithms, called Langevin, Dispersion, and DisCo, aimed at generating large synthetic face datasets. With this in hands, we generate several face datasets and benchmark them by training face recognition models, showing that data generated with our method exceeds the performance of previously GAN-based datasets and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art diffusion-based synthetic datasets. While diffusion models are shown to memorize training data, we prevent leakage in our new synthetic datasets, paving the way for more responsible synthetic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling with Safety Meta Token for Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> | [Code Link](https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe) |
| **[The Role of Visual Modality in Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning: Challenges and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04167v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has increasingly focused on multimodal mathematical reasoning, particularly emphasizing the creation of relevant datasets and benchmarks. Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities. Additionally, we observe that the common approach of improving general VQA capabilities by combining various types of image encoders does not contribute to math reasoning performance. This finding also presents a challenge to enhancing visual reliance during math reasoning.

Existing datasets contain few identities and limited samples per finger, restricting the advancement of deep learning-based methods. To address this, we introduce FVeinSyn, a synthetic generator capable of producing diverse finger vein patterns with rich intra-class variations. Using FVeinSyn, we created FingerVeinSyn-5M -- the largest available finger vein dataset -- containing 5 million samples from 50,000 unique fingers, each with 100 variations including shift, rotation, scale, roll, varying exposure levels, skin scattering blur, optical blur, and motion blur. FingerVeinSyn-5M is also the first to offer fully annotated finger vein images, supporting deep learning applications in this field. Models pretrained on FingerVeinSyn-5M and fine-tuned with minimal real data achieve an average 53.91\% performance gain across multiple benchmarks.

Existing datasets for RRSIS suffer from critical limitations in resolution, scene diversity, and category coverage, which hinders the generalization and real-world applicability of refer segmentation models. To facilitate the development of this field, we introduce NWPU-Refer, the largest and most diverse RRSIS dataset to date, comprising 15,003 high-resolution images (1024-2048px) spanning 30+ countries with 49,745 annotated targets supporting single-object, multi-object, and non-object segmentation scenarios. Additionally, we propose the Multi-scale Referring Segmentation Network (MRSNet), a novel framework tailored for the unique demands of RRSIS. MRSNet introduces two key innovations: (1) an Intra-scale Feature Interaction Module (IFIM) that captures fine-grained details within each encoder stage, and (2) a Hierarchical Feature Interaction Module (HFIM) to enable seamless cross-scale feature fusion, preserving spatial integrity while enhancing discriminative power. Extensive experiments conducte on the proposed NWPU-Refer dataset demonstrate that MRSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness.

We present a novel automated pipeline for generating binary classification datasets that addresses this critical gap through several algorithmic innovations: intelligent multi-source label fusion, confidence-aware filtering, automated label correction, and systematic fine-grained benchmark generation. Crucially, automation is not merely convenient but necessary to cope with TinyML's diverse applications. TinyML requires bespoke datasets tailored to specific deployment constraints and use cases, making manual approaches prohibitively expensive and impractical for widespread adoption. Using our pipeline, we create Wake Vision, a large-scale binary classification dataset of almost 6 million images that demonstrates our methodology through person detection--the canonical vision task for TinyML. Wake Vision achieves up to a 6.6% accuracy improvement over existing datasets via a carefully designed two-stage training strategy and provides 100x more images. We demonstrate our broad applicability for automated large-scale TinyML dataset generation across two additional target categories, and show our label error rates are substantially lower than prior work. Our comprehensive fine-grained benchmark suite evaluates model robustness across five critical dimensions, revealing failure modes masked by aggregate metrics. To ensure continuous improvement, we establish ongoing community engagement through competitions hosted by the Edge AI Foundation. All datasets, benchmarks, and code are available under CC-BY 4.0 license, providing a systematic foundation for advancing TinyML research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating. STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better fine-tuning strategies.

However, this approach fails to consider one crucial aspect of the systems: whether their outputs accurately reflect the users' (post-purchase) sentiments, i.e., whether and why they would like and/or dislike the recommended items. To shed light on this issue, we introduce new datasets and evaluation methods that focus on the users' sentiments. Specifically, we construct the datasets by explicitly extracting users' positive and negative opinions from their post-purchase reviews using an LLM, and propose to evaluate systems based on whether the generated explanations 1) align well with the users' sentiments, and 2) accurately identify both positive and negative opinions of users on the target items. We benchmark several recent models on our datasets and demonstrate that achieving strong performance on existing metrics does not ensure that the generated explanations align well with the users' sentiments. Lastly, we find that existing models can provide more sentiment-aware explanations when the users' (predicted) ratings for the target items are directly fed into the models as input.

Recent research on applying machine learning to RDBs has explored graph-based representations of RDBs, where rows of tables are modeled as nodes, and foreign key relationships are modeled as edges. RDB-to-graph modeling helps capture cross-table dependencies, ultimately leading to enhanced performance across diverse tasks. However, there are numerous ways to model RDBs as graphs, and performance varies significantly depending on the chosen graph model. In our analysis, applying a common heuristic rule for graph modeling leads to up to a 10% drop in performance compared to the best-performing graph model, which remains non-trivial to identify. To foster research on intelligent RDB-to-graph modeling, we introduce RDB2G-Bench, the first benchmark framework for evaluating such methods. We construct extensive datasets covering 5 real-world RDBs and 12 predictive tasks, resulting in around 50k graph-performance pairs for efficient and reproducible evaluations. Thanks to our precomputed datasets, we were able to benchmark 9 automatic RDB-to-graph modeling methods on the 12 tasks over 600x faster than on-the-fly evaluation, which requires repeated model training. Our analysis of the datasets and benchmark results reveals key structural patterns affecting graph model effectiveness, along with practical implications for effective graph modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and datasets are in https://github.com/chlehdwon/RDB2G-Bench</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/chlehdwon/RDB2G-Bench) |

The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks.

We introduce EgoExOR, the first OR dataset and accompanying benchmark to fuse first-person and third-person perspectives.

Its detailed scene graph annotations, covering 36 entities and 22 relations (568,235 triplets), enable robust modeling of clinical interactions, supporting tasks like action recognition and human-centric perception. We evaluate the surgical scene graph generation performance of two adapted state-of-the-art models and offer a new baseline that explicitly leverages EgoExOR's multimodal and multi-perspective signals.

Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) are known to struggle with counting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of several recent LVLMs on visual counting tasks across multiple counting and vision datasets. We observe that while their performance may be less prone to error for small numbers of objects, they exhibit significant weaknesses as the number of objects increases. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective baseline method that enhances LVLMs' counting ability for large numbers of objects using a divide-and-conquer approach. Our method decomposes counting problems into sub-tasks. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism to prevent objects from being split during division, which could otherwise lead to repetitive counting -- a common issue in a naive divide-and-conquer implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and benchmarks, establishing it as a valuable reference for evaluating future solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 24 Figures, 19 Tables</p></details> | None |

To address this gap, we present the Vehicles in the Middle East (VME) dataset, designed explicitly for vehicle detection in high-resolution satellite images from Middle Eastern countries. Sourced from Maxar, the VME dataset spans 54 cities across 12 countries, comprising over 4,000 image tiles and more than 100,000 vehicles, annotated using both manual and semi-automated methods. Additionally, we introduce the largest benchmark dataset for Car Detection in Satellite Imagery (CDSI), combining images from multiple sources to enhance global car detection. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on existing datasets perform poorly on Middle Eastern images, while the VME dataset significantly improves detection accuracy in this region. Moreover, state-of-the-art models trained on CDSI achieve substantial improvements in global car detection.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this gap, we introduce Pearl, a large-scale Arabic multimodal dataset and benchmark explicitly designed for cultural understanding. Constructed through advanced agentic workflows and extensive human-in-the-loop annotations by 45 annotators from across the Arab world, Pearl comprises over K multimodal examples spanning ten culturally significant domains covering all Arab countries. We further provide two robust evaluation benchmarks Pearl and Pearl-Lite along with a specialized subset Pearl-X explicitly developed to assess nuanced cultural variations. Comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art open and proprietary LVLMs demonstrate that reasoning-centric instruction alignment substantially improves models' cultural grounding compared to conventional scaling methods. Pearl establishes a foundational resource for advancing culturally-informed multimodal modeling research.

However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 | None |

However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models.

Specifically, we propose the first Object-agnostic State Classification (OaSC) method that infers the state of a certain object without relying on the knowledge or the estimation of the object class. In that direction, we capitalize on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for structuring and organizing knowledge, which, in combination with visual information, enable the inference of the states of objects in object/state pairs that have not been encountered in the method's training set. A series of experiments investigate the performance of the proposed method in various settings, against several hypotheses and in comparison with state of the art approaches for object attribute classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge of an object class is not decisive for the prediction of its state.

Bent radio AGN, distinguished by their curved jet structures, provide critical insights into galaxy cluster dynamics, interactions within the intracluster medium, and the broader physics of AGN. Despite their astrophysical significance, the classification of bent radio AGN remains a challenge due to the scarcity of specialized datasets and benchmarks. To address this, we present a dataset, derived from a well-recognized radio astronomy survey, that is designed to support the classification of NAT (Narrow-Angle Tail) and WAT (Wide-Angle Tail) categories, along with detailed data processing steps. We further evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on the dataset, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer-based architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced machine learning models in classifying bent radio AGN, with ConvNeXT achieving the highest F1-scores for both NAT and WAT sources.

It utilizes pretraining multimodal foundation models to generate infinite unique photo-realistic scene variants that adhere to real-world semantics and daily commonsense for the training and the evaluation of navigation agents, accompanied with a plugin for generating object navigation task episodes compatible to the Habitat simulator. In addition, we offer two pre-generated object navigation task datasets, SD-OVON-3k and SD-OVON-10k, comprising respectively about 3k and 10k episodes of the open-vocabulary object navigation task, derived from the SD-OVON-Scenes dataset with 2.5k photo-realistic scans of real-world environments and the SD-OVON-Objects dataset with 0.9k manually inspected scanned and artist-created manipulatable object models. Unlike prior datasets limited to static environments, SD-OVON covers dynamic scenes and manipulatable objects, facilitating both real-to-sim and sim-to-real robotic applications. This approach enhances the realism of navigation tasks, the training and the evaluation of open-vocabulary object navigation agents in complex settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and datasets, we propose two baselines and evaluate them along with state-of-the-art baselines on SD-OVON-3k.

However, reliable pose and depth perception remain fundamental challenges due to the transparent or low-contrast nature of the microrobots, as well as the noisy and dynamic conditions of the microscale environments in which they operate. An open dataset is crucial for enabling reproducible research, facilitating benchmarking, and accelerating the development of perception models tailored to microscale challenges. Standardised evaluation enables consistent comparison across algorithms, ensuring objective benchmarking and facilitating reproducible research. Here, we introduce the OpTical MicroRobot dataset (OTMR), the first publicly available dataset designed to support microrobot perception under the optical microscope. OTMR contains 232,881 images spanning 18 microrobot types and 176 distinct poses. We benchmarked the performance of eight deep learning models, including architectures derived via neural architecture search (NAS), on two key tasks: pose classification and depth regression. Results indicated that Vision Transformer (ViT) achieve the highest accuracy in pose classification, while depth regression benefits from deeper architectures. Additionally, increasing the size of the training dataset leads to substantial improvements across both tasks, highlighting OTMR's potential as a foundational resource for robust and generalisable microrobot perception in complex microscale environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 International Conference on Manipulation, Automation and Robotics at Small Scales (MARSS)</p></details> | None |

However, many of these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark, we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual reality, information retrieval, and other related fields.

We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research. To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000 pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in judicial decision-making.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, the capability of existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA, the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering, highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction, and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions: (1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward, and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional space (+6% improvement).</p></details> |  | None |

To address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across 207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp, and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with 125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets -- Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when leveraging multimodal and structural cues.

However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment. Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, (ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 60K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 58,500 videos generated from 30 T2V models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2V generation and V2T interpretation capabilities. Based on AIGVE-60K, we propose LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other AIGV evaluation benchmarks.

To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets.

Despite its flexibility and statistical reliability, cubic computational complexity limits its application to large datasets. To address this computational bottleneck, we propose \textit{FastKCI}, a scalable and parallelizable kernel-based conditional independence test that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach inspired by embarrassingly parallel inference techniques for Gaussian processes. By partitioning the dataset based on a Gaussian mixture model over the conditioning variables, FastKCI conducts local KCI tests in parallel, aggregating the results using an importance-weighted sampling scheme. Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks on real-world production data validate that FastKCI maintains the statistical power of the original KCI test while achieving substantial computational speedups. FastKCI thus represents a practical and efficient solution for conditional independence testing in causal inference on large-scale data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

Optical images offer rich textural details but are often affected by low-light, cloud-obscured, or low-resolution conditions, reducing the detection performance. SAR images are robust to weather, but suffer from speckle noise and limited semantic expressiveness. Optical and SAR images provide complementary advantages, and fusing them can significantly improve the detection accuracy. However, progress in this field is hindered by the lack of large-scale, standardized datasets. To address these challenges, we propose the first comprehensive dataset for optical-SAR fusion object detection, named Multi-resolution, Multi-polarization, Multi-scene, Multi-source SAR dataset (M4-SAR). It contains 112,184 precisely aligned image pairs and nearly one million labeled instances with arbitrary orientations, spanning six key categories. To enable standardized evaluation, we develop a unified benchmarking toolkit that integrates six state-of-the-art multi-source fusion methods. Furthermore, we propose E2E-OSDet, a novel end-to-end multi-source fusion detection framework that mitigates cross-domain discrepancies and establishes a robust baseline for future studies. Extensive experiments on M4-SAR demonstrate that fusing optical and SAR data can improve $mAP$ by 5.7\% over single-source inputs, with particularly significant gains in complex environments.

| **[RobustSpring: Benchmarking Robustness to Image Corruptions for Optical Flow, Scene Flow and Stereo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09368v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard benchmarks for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo vision algorithms generally focus on model accuracy rather than robustness to image corruptions like noise or rain. Hence, the resilience of models to such real-world perturbations is largely unquantified. To address this, we present RobustSpring, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating robustness to image corruptions for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo models. RobustSpring applies 20 different image corruptions, including noise, blur, color changes, quality degradations, and weather distortions, in a time-, stereo-, and depth-consistent manner to the high-resolution Spring dataset, creating a suite of 20,000 corrupted images that reflect challenging conditions. RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new corruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables public two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a curated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not necessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type. RobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a first-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience. It will be available at https://spring-benchmark.org.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models.

Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized RS data sources without exposing raw data. However, there lacks a realistic federated dataset and benchmark in RS. Prior works typically rely on manually partitioned single dataset, which fail to capture the heterogeneity and scale of real-world RS data, and often use inconsistent experimental setups, hindering fair comparison. To address this gap, we propose a realistic federated RS dataset, termed FedRS. FedRS consists of eight datasets that cover various sensors and resolutions and builds 135 clients, which is representative of realistic operational scenarios. Data for each client come from the same source, exhibiting authentic federated properties such as skewed label distributions, imbalanced client data volumes, and domain heterogeneity across clients. These characteristics reflect practical challenges in federated RS and support evaluation of FL methods at scale. Based on FedRS, we implement 10 baseline FL algorithms and evaluation metrics to construct the comprehensive FedRS-Bench. The experimental results demonstrate that FL can consistently improve model performance over training on isolated data silos, while revealing performance trade-offs of different methods under varying client heterogeneity and availability conditions. We hope FedRS-Bench will accelerate research on large-scale, realistic FL in RS by providing a standardized, rich testbed and facilitating fair comparisons across future works.

| **[BihoT: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Hyperspectral Camouflaged Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12232v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral object tracking (HOT) has exhibited potential in various applications, particularly in scenes where objects are camouflaged. Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2025</p></details> | None |

While LLMs excel on general tasks, their systematic evaluation on these highly specialized, accuracy-critical, and inherently procedural texts remains limited. In this work, we present BioProBench, the first large-scale, integrated multi-task benchmark for biological protocol understanding and reasoning. While limited benchmarks have touched upon specific aspects like protocol QA, BioProBench provides a comprehensive suite of five core tasks: Protocol Question Answering, Step Ordering, Error Correction, Protocol Generation, and Protocol Reasoning, enabling a holistic evaluation of LLMs on procedural biological texts. Built upon 27K original protocols, it yields nearly 556K high-quality structured instances. We evaluate 12 mainstream open/closed-source LLMs on BioProBench. Experimental results reveal that while top models preform well on surface understanding tasks, struggle significantly with deep reasoning and structured generation tasks like ordering and generation. Furthermore, model comparisons reveal diverse performance: certain open-source models approach closed-source levels on some tasks, yet bio-specific small models lag behind general LLMs, indicating limitations on complex procedural content. Overall, our findings underscore that procedural reasoning within biological protocols represents a significant challenge for current LLMs. BioProBench serves as a standardized framework to diagnose these specific limitations and guide the development of AI systems better equipped for safely automating complex scientific procedures.

However, existing studies have relied on private datasets and simplistic degradation models. To address this gap, we introduce UFPR-SR-Plates, a novel dataset containing 10,000 tracks with 100,000 paired low and high-resolution license plate images captured under real-world conditions. We establish a benchmark using multiple sequential LR and high-resolution (HR) images per vehicle -- five of each -- and two state-of-the-art models for super-resolution of license plates. We also investigate three fusion strategies to evaluate how combining predictions from a leading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for multiple super-resolved license plates enhances overall performance. Our findings demonstrate that super-resolution significantly boosts LPR performance, with further improvements observed when applying majority vote-based fusion techniques. Specifically, the Layout-Aware and Character-Driven Network (LCDNet) model combined with the Majority Vote by Character Position (MVCP) strategy led to the highest recognition rates, increasing from 1.7% with low-resolution images to 31.1% with super-resolution, and up to 44.7% when combining OCR outputs from five super-resolved images. These findings underscore the critical role of super-resolution and temporal information in enhancing LPR accuracy under real-world, adverse conditions.

However, most assume straight light paths and therefore cannot properly handle refractive and reflective materials. Moreover, datasets specialized for these effects are limited, stymieing efforts to evaluate performance and develop suitable techniques. In this work, we introduce a synthetic RefRef dataset and benchmark for reconstructing scenes with refractive and reflective objects from posed images. Our dataset has 50 such objects of varying complexity, from single-material convex shapes to multi-material non-convex shapes, each placed in three different background types, resulting in 150 scenes. We also propose an oracle method that, given the object geometry and refractive indices, calculates accurate light paths for neural rendering, and an approach based on this that avoids these assumptions. We benchmark these against several state-of-the-art methods and show that all methods lag significantly behind the oracle, highlighting the challenges of the task and dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, temporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered significant attention in recent years. TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into low-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and temporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving data environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational concepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods, systematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized during the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source of datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical investigations. Finally, we examine key open challenges and explore promising research directions in TIGRL, laying the groundwork for future advancements that have the potential to shape the evolution of this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> | None |

We identify two key challenges: modality discrepancy, where existing large touch-language models often treat touch as a mere sub-modality of language, and open-ended tactile data scarcity, where current datasets lack the diversity, open-endness and complexity needed for reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SToLa, a Self-Adaptive Touch-Language framework. SToLa utilizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) to dynamically process, unify, and manage tactile and language modalities, capturing their unique characteristics. Crucially, we also present a comprehensive tactile commonsense reasoning dataset and benchmark featuring free-form questions and responses, 8 physical properties, 4 interactive characteristics, and diverse commonsense knowledge. Experiments show SToLa exhibits competitive performance compared to existing models on the PhysiCLeAR benchmark and self-constructed datasets, proving the effectiveness of the Mixture of Experts architecture in multimodal management and the performance advantages for open-scenario tactile commonsense reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their efficacy in the Arabic medical domain remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets. We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities, including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with five state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare.

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community.

However, the integration of multimodal data, including raw waveform signals, remains underexplored in clinical decision support. Methods: We present a dataset and benchmarking protocol designed to advance multimodal decision support in emergency care. Our models utilize demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms as inputs to predict both discharge diagnoses and patient deterioration.

During heavy rainfall, the interference from raindrops can adversely affect the quality of LiDAR point clouds, resulting in, for instance, inaccurate point measurements. This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if autonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to discern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal emulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D point cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our dataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise annotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR data (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and nighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore, REHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant value not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of weather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop detection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our comprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical and deep-learning models. Upon publication, the dataset and benchmark models will be made publicly available at: https://sporsho.github.io/REHEARSE3D.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://sporsho.github.io/REHEARSE3D) |

However, robotics faces unique challenges in scaling data and establishing evaluation protocols. Collecting real-world data is resource-intensive and inefficient, while benchmarking in real-world scenarios remains highly complex. Synthetic data and simulation offer promising alternatives, yet existing efforts often fall short in data quality, diversity, and benchmark standardization. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboVerse, a comprehensive framework comprising a simulation platform, a synthetic dataset, and unified benchmarks. Our simulation platform supports multiple simulators and robotic embodiments, enabling seamless transitions between different environments. The synthetic dataset, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering, is constructed through multiple approaches. Additionally, we propose unified benchmarks for imitation learning and reinforcement learning, enabling evaluation across different levels of generalization. At the core of the simulation platform is MetaSim, an infrastructure that abstracts diverse simulation environments into a universal interface. It restructures existing simulation environments into a simulator-agnostic configuration system, as well as an API aligning different simulator functionalities, such as launching simulation environments, loading assets with initial states, stepping the physics engine, etc. This abstraction ensures interoperability and extensibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RoboVerse enhances the performance of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world model learning, and sim-to-real transfer. These results validate the reliability of our dataset and benchmarks, establishing RoboVerse as a robust solution for advancing robot learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Comprising a 1-hour video (67,760 frames) of eight Holstein Friesian calves with unique coat patterns and 900 static frames, the dataset emphasizes real-world challenges like prolonged occlusions, motion blur, and pose variation. By fine-tuning 28 object detectors (YOLO variants, transformers) and evaluating 23 pretrained backbones (ResNet, ConvNextV2, ViTs), we expose critical architectural trade-offs: smaller models (e.g., ConvNextV2 Nano, 15.6M parameters) excel in efficiency and retrieval accuracy, while pure vision transformers lag in occlusion-heavy settings. The dataset's structured design-fixed camera views, natural motion, and verified identities-provides a reproducible testbed for object detection challenges (mAP50:95: 56.5-66.4%), bridging synthetic simplicity and domain-specific complexity.

While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DataS^3: Dataset Subset Selection for Specialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16277v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world machine learning (ML) applications (e.g. detecting broken bones in x-ray images, detecting species in camera traps), in practice models need to perform well on specific deployments (e.g. a specific hospital, a specific national park) rather than the domain broadly. However, deployments often have imbalanced, unique data distributions. Discrepancy between the training distribution and the deployment distribution can lead to suboptimal performance, highlighting the need to select deployment-specialized subsets from the available training data. We formalize dataset subset selection for specialization (DS3): given a training set drawn from a general distribution and a (potentially unlabeled) query set drawn from the desired deployment-specific distribution, the goal is to select a subset of the training data that optimizes deployment performance. We introduce DataS^3; the first dataset and benchmark designed specifically for the DS3 problem. DataS^3 encompasses diverse real-world application domains, each with a set of distinct deployments to specialize in. We conduct a comprehensive study evaluating algorithms from various families--including coresets, data filtering, and data curation--on DataS^3, and find that general-distribution methods consistently fail on deployment-specific tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of manually curated (deployment-specific) expert subsets that outperform training on all available data with accuracy gains up to 51.3 percent. Our benchmark highlights the critical role of tailored dataset curation in enhancing performance and training efficiency on deployment-specific distributions, which we posit will only become more important as global, public datasets become available across domains and ML models are deployed in the real world.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks either focus narrowly on patents or cover limited aspects of the IP field, lacking alignment with real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive IP task taxonomy and a large, diverse bilingual benchmark, IPBench, covering 8 IP mechanisms and 20 tasks. This benchmark is designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world intellectual property applications, encompassing both understanding and generation. We benchmark 16 LLMs, ranging from general-purpose to domain-specific models, and find that even the best-performing model achieves only 75.8% accuracy, revealing substantial room for improvement. Notably, open-source IP and law-oriented models lag behind closed-source general-purpose models. We publicly release all data and code of IPBench and will continue to update it with additional IP-related tasks to better reflect real-world challenges in the intellectual property domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>89 pa...</summary><p>89 pages, 75 figures, 55 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Understanding Camera Motions in Any Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15376v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find, for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two. Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding camera motions in any video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project site: https://linzhiqiu.github.io/papers/camerabench/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://linzhiqiu.github.io/papers) |

In the era of rapidly growing mutimodal content and social media, MCR is particularly crucial for interpreting user interactions and bridging text-visual references to improve communication and personalization. However, MCR research for real-world dialogues remains unexplored due to the lack of sufficient data resources.To address this gap, we introduce TikTalkCoref, the first Chinese multimodal coreference dataset for social media in real-world scenarios, derived from the popular Douyin short-video platform. This dataset pairs short videos with corresponding textual dialogues from user comments and includes manually annotated coreference clusters for both person mentions in the text and the coreferential person head regions in the corresponding video frames. We also present an effective benchmark approach for MCR, focusing on the celebrity domain, and conduct extensive experiments on our dataset, providing reliable benchmark results for this newly constructed dataset. We will release the TikTalkCoref dataset to facilitate future research on MCR for real-world social media dialogues.</p></details> |  | None |

WildlifeReID-10k covers diverse animal species and poses significant challenges for SoTA methods, ensuring fair and robust evaluation through its time-aware and similarity-aware split protocol. The latter is designed to address the common issue of training-to-test data leakage caused by visually similar images appearing in both training and test sets. The WildlifeReID-10k dataset and benchmark are publicly available on Kaggle, along with strong baselines for both closed-set and open-set evaluation, enabling fair, transparent, and standardized evaluation of not just multi-species animal re-identification models.</p></details> |  | None |

Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 tables, 18 figures</p></details> | None |

A digital twin of a 3D object is a highly detailed, virtually indistinguishable representation of a physical object, accurately capturing its shape, appearance, physical properties, and other attributes. Recent advances in neural-based 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering have significantly improved the quality of 3D object reconstruction. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of a large-scale, digital twin quality real-world dataset and benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of different reconstruction methods, as well as improve reconstruction quality through training or fine-tuning. Moreover, to democratize 3D digital twin creation, it is essential to integrate creation techniques with next-generation egocentric computing platforms, such as AR glasses. Currently, there is no dataset available to evaluate 3D object reconstruction using egocentric captured images. To address these gaps, the DTC dataset features 2,000 scanned digital twin-quality 3D objects, along with image sequences captured under different lighting conditions using DSLR cameras and egocentric AR glasses. This dataset establishes the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for 3D digital twin creation tasks, offering a robust foundation for comparing and improving existing reconstruction methods. The DTC dataset is already released at https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/ and we will also make the baseline evaluations open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to CVPR 2025 highlights</p></details> | None |

However, many generated images still suffer from issues related to perceptual quality and text-image alignment. Given the high cost and inefficiency of manual evaluation, an automatic metric that aligns with human preferences is desirable. To this end, we present EvalMi-50K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating large-multimodal image generation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 2,100 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, and (ii) large-scale human-preference annotations, including 100K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 50K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 50,400 images generated from 24 T2I models. Based on EvalMi-50K, we propose LMM4LMM, an LMM-based metric for evaluating large multimodal T2I generation from multiple dimensions including perception, text-image correspondence, and task-specific accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that LMM4LMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EvalMi-50K, and exhibits strong generalization ability on other AI-generated image evaluation benchmark datasets, manifesting the generality of both the EvalMi-50K dataset and LMM4LMM metric. Both EvalMi-50K and LMM4LMM will be released at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4LMM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4LMM) |

However, its application has predominantly been confined to imaging modalities such as panoramic radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography, with limited focus on auxiliary analysis specifically targeting Periapical Radiographs (PR). PR are the most extensively utilized imaging modality in endodontics and periodontics due to their capability to capture detailed local lesions at a low cost. Nevertheless, challenges such as resolution limitations and artifacts complicate the annotation and recognition of PR, leading to a scarcity of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality PR analysis datasets. This scarcity has somewhat impeded the advancement of DL applications in PR analysis. In this paper, we present PRAD-10K, a dataset for PR analysis. PRAD-10K comprises 10,000 clinical periapical radiograph images, with pixel-level annotations provided by professional dentists for nine distinct anatomical structures, lesions, and artificial restorations or medical devices, We also include classification labels for images with typical conditions or lesions. Furthermore, we introduce a DL network named PRNet to establish benchmarks for PR segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that PRNet surpasses previous state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models on the PRAD-10K dataset. The codes and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages & Under Review</p></details> | None |
| **[RASMD: RGB And SWIR Multispectral Driving Dataset for Robust Perception in Adverse Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07603v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous driving algorithms heavily rely on the visible spectrum, which is prone to performance degradation in adverse conditions like fog, rain, snow, glare, and high contrast. Although other spectral bands like near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception in such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over NIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently incorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce the RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000 synchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a subset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset of challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging through experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation. Our experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework significantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches, particularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We anticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral imaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VideoPainter: Any-length Video Inpainting and Editing with Plug-and-Play Context Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05639v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video inpainting, which aims to restore corrupted video content, has experienced substantial progress. Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://yxbian23.github.io/project/video-painter</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yxbian23.github.io/project) |

We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional frame-based cameras, widely used in UAV-based inspections, often struggle to capture defects under low or dynamic lighting conditions. In contrast, Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), or event-based cameras, excel in such scenarios by minimizing motion blur, enhancing power efficiency, and maintaining high-quality imaging across diverse lighting conditions without saturation or information loss. Despite these advantages, existing research lacks studies exploring the feasibility of using DVS for detecting civil structural defects.Moreover, there is no dedicated event-based dataset tailored for this purpose. Addressing this gap, this study introduces the first event-based civil infrastructure defect detection dataset, capturing defective surfaces as a spatio-temporal event stream using DVS.In addition to event-based data, the dataset includes grayscale intensity image frames captured simultaneously using an Active Pixel Sensor (APS). Both data types were collected using the DAVIS346 camera, which integrates DVS and APS sensors.The dataset focuses on two types of defects: cracks and spalling, and includes data from both field and laboratory environments. The field dataset comprises 318 recording sequences,documenting 458 distinct cracks and 121 distinct spalling instances.The laboratory dataset includes 362 recording sequences, covering 220 distinct cracks and 308 spalling instances.Four realtime object detection models were evaluated on it to validate the dataset effectiveness.The results demonstrate the dataset robustness in enabling accurate defect detection and classification,even under challenging lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>A jou...</summary><p>A journal paper which submitted to Sage SHM journa and it is under review currently. consist of 25 pages.

Recently, language models (LMs) and foundational models (FMs) are being utilized as automatic evaluators of human-AI interactions with the goal of eventually being used to improve the policy of the AI agent. To enable further research in this direction, we introduce a large-scale real-world Human Robot Social Interaction (HSRI) Dataset to benchmark the capabilities of LMs and FMs to identify and reason about social interactions, specifically with regard to robot social errors and competencies . Our dataset consists of 400 real-world human social robot interaction videos and over 10K annotations, detailing the robot's social errors, competencies, rationale, and corrective actions, capturing unique aspects of human-AI interaction only present in real-world interactions. To further assess AI models' ability to reason about social interactions, we propose eight new benchmark tasks for evaluating centered around whether AI models can (1) evaluate social interactions via detecting social errors and competencies, (2) identify the explanatory factors associated to errors and competencies, (3) understand the flow of real-world social interactions, and (4) provide reasons and corrective actions for social errors. Human studies and experiments with modern LMs and FMs reveal that current models struggle with these tasks, demonstrating that our dataset and benchmark provides a step forward towards socially intelligent AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  | None |

To expand the scope of clinical applications, we formulate a novel setting, "OCT-enhanced disease recognition from fundus images", that allows for the use of unpaired multi-modal data during the training phase and relies on the widespread fundus photographs for testing. To benchmark this setting, we present the first large multi-modal multi-class dataset for eye disease diagnosis, MultiEYE, and propose an OCT-assisted Conceptual Distillation Approach (OCT-CoDA), which employs semantically rich concepts to extract disease-related knowledge from OCT images and leverage them into the fundus model. Specifically, we regard the image-concept relation as a link to distill useful knowledge from the OCT teacher model to the fundus student model, which considerably improves the diagnostic performance based on fundus images and formulates the cross-modal knowledge transfer into an explainable process. Through extensive experiments on the multi-disease classification task, our proposed OCT-CoDA demonstrates remarkable results and interpretability, showing great potential for clinical application.

In this work, we present VietMed - a Vietnamese speech recognition dataset in the medical domain comprising 16h of labeled medical speech, 1000h of unlabeled medical speech and 1200h of unlabeled general-domain speech. To our best knowledge, VietMed is by far the world's largest public medical speech recognition dataset in 7 aspects: total duration, number of speakers, diseases, recording conditions, speaker roles, unique medical terms and accents.

To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multi-Modal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark. We also propose our baseline method Vehicle-to-Vehicle Multi-Modal Large Language Model (V2V-LLM), which uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and answer various types of driving-related questions: grounding, notable object identification, and planning. Experimental results show that our proposed V2V-LLM can be a promising unified model architecture for performing various tasks in cooperative autonomous driving, and outperforms other baseline methods that use different fusion approaches. Our work also creates a new research direction that can improve the safety of future autonomous driving systems.

However, current research primarily focuses on the basic alignment issues of ego-exo data from different cameras, rather than collecting data from the imitator's perspective, which is inconsistent with the high-level cognitive process. To advance this research, we introduce a novel large-scale egocentric dataset, called EgoMe, which towards following the process of human imitation learning via the imitator's egocentric view in the real world. Our dataset includes 7902 paired exo-ego videos (totaling15804 videos) spanning diverse daily behaviors in various real-world scenarios. For each video pair, one video captures an exocentric view of the imitator observing the demonstrator's actions, while the other captures an egocentric view of the imitator subsequently following those actions. Notably, EgoMe uniquely incorporates exo-ego eye gaze, other multi-modal sensor IMU data and different-level annotations for assisting in establishing correlations between observing and imitating process. We further provide a suit of challenging benchmarks for fully leveraging this data resource and promoting the robot imitation learning research. Extensive analysis demonstrates significant advantages over existing datasets.

The ability to identify shapes regardless of orientation, texture, or context, and to recognize textures independently of their associated objects, is essential for general visual understanding of the world. We introduce the Large Shape & Textures dataset (LAS&T), a giant collection of diverse shapes and textures automatically extracted from real-world images. This dataset is used to evaluate how effectively leading Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) understand shapes, textures, and materials in both 2D and 3D scenes. For shape recognition, we test models' ability to match identical shapes that differ in orientation, texture, color, or environment. Our results show that LVLMs' shape identification capabilities remain significantly below human performance. Single alterations (orientation, texture) cause minor decreases in matching accuracy, while multiple changes precipitate dramatic drops. LVLMs appear to rely predominantly on high-level and semantic features and struggle with abstract shapes lacking clear class associations. For texture and material recognition, we evaluate models' ability to identify identical textures and materials across different objects and environments. Interestingly, leading LVLMs approach human-level performance in recognizing materials in 3D scenes, yet substantially underperform humans when identifying simpler 2D textures. The LAS&T dataset and benchmark, the largest and most diverse resource for shape and texture evaluation, is freely available with generation and testing scripts.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Ocularone-Bench: Benchmarking DNN Models on GPUs to Assist the Visually Impaired](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03709v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>VIP navigation requires multiple DNN models for identification, posture analysis, and depth estimation to ensure safe mobility. Using a hazard vest as a unique identifier enhances visibility while selecting the right DNN model and computing device balances accuracy and real-time performance. We present Ocularone-Bench, which is a benchmark suite designed to address the lack of curated datasets for uniquely identifying individuals in crowded environments and the need for benchmarking DNN inference times on resource-constrained edge devices. The suite evaluates the accuracy-latency trade-offs of YOLO models retrained on this dataset and benchmarks inference times of situation awareness models across edge accelerators and high-end GPU workstations. Our study on NVIDIA Jetson devices and RTX 4090 workstation demonstrates significant improvements in detection accuracy, achieving up to 99.4% precision, while also providing insights into real-time feasibility for mobile deployment. Beyond VIP navigation, Ocularone-Bench is applicable to senior citizens, children and worker safety monitoring, and other vision-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, To Appear at the IEEE Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing for Computational Social Systems (ParSocial), Co-located with IEEE IPDPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ST-VLM: Kinematic Instruction Tuning for Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19355v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal reasoning is essential in understanding real-world environments in various fields, eg, autonomous driving and sports analytics. Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning.

| **[Can Vision-Language Models Answer Face to Face Questions in the Real-World?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19356v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models have made significant strides in recent years in their ability to describe and answer questions about real-world images. They have also made progress in the ability to converse with users in real-time using audio input. This raises the question: have we reached the point where AI models, connected to a camera and microphone, can converse with users in real-time about scenes and events that are unfolding live in front of the camera? This has been a long-standing goal in AI and is a prerequisite for real-world AI assistants and humanoid robots to interact with humans in everyday situations. In this work, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark, the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD), which allows us to assess the extent to which existing models can support these abilities, and to what degree these capabilities can be instilled through fine-tuning. The dataset is based on a simple question-answering setup, where users ask questions that the system has to answer, in real-time, based on the camera and audio input. We show that existing models fall far behind human performance on this task, and we identify the main sources for the performance gap. However, we also show that for many of the required perceptual skills, fine-tuning on this form of data can significantly reduce this gap.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GoDe: Gaussians on Demand for Progressive Level of Detail and Scalable Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13558v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting enhances real-time performance in novel view synthesis by representing scenes with mixtures of Gaussians and utilizing differentiable rasterization. However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Grained Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Fined-Grained Prompts: Task, Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14862v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary detectors are proposed to locate and recognize objects in novel classes. However, variations in vision-aware language vocabulary data used for open-vocabulary learning can lead to unfair and unreliable evaluations. Recent evaluation methods have attempted to address this issue by incorporating object properties or adding locations and characteristics to the captions. Nevertheless, since these properties and locations depend on the specific details of the images instead of classes, detectors can not make accurate predictions without precise descriptions provided through human annotation. This paper introduces 3F-OVD, a novel task that extends supervised fine-grained object detection to the open-vocabulary setting. Our task is intuitive and challenging, requiring a deep understanding of Fine-grained captions and careful attention to Fine-grained details in images in order to accurately detect Fine-grained objects. Additionally, due to the scarcity of qualified fine-grained object detection datasets, we have created a new dataset, NEU-171K, tailored for both supervised and open-vocabulary settings. We benchmark state-of-the-art object detectors on our dataset for both settings. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective post-processing technique.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Safety at Scale: A Comprehensive Survey of Large Model Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05206v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 3 figures, 11 tables; GitHub: https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety) |
| **[OpenLLM-RTL: Open Dataset and Benchmark for LLM-Aided Design RTL Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15112v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automated generation of design RTL based on large language model (LLM) and natural language instructions has demonstrated great potential in agile circuit design. However, the lack of datasets and benchmarks in the public domain prevents the development and fair evaluation of LLM solutions. This paper highlights our latest advances in open datasets and benchmarks from three perspectives: (1) RTLLM 2.0, an updated benchmark assessing LLM's capability in design RTL generation. The benchmark is augmented to 50 hand-crafted designs. Each design provides the design description, test cases, and a correct RTL code. (2) AssertEval, an open-source benchmark assessing the LLM's assertion generation capabilities for RTL verification. The benchmark includes 18 designs, each providing specification, signal definition, and correct RTL code. (3) RTLCoder-Data, an extended open-source dataset with 80K instruction-code data samples. Moreover, we propose a new verification-based method to verify the functionality correctness of training data samples. Based on this technique, we further release a dataset with 7K verified high-quality samples. These three studies are integrated into one framework, providing off-the-shelf support for the development and evaluation of LLMs for RTL code generation and verification. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that LLM performance can be boosted by enlarging the training dataset, improving data quality, and improving the training scheme.</p></details> | ICCAD'24 | None |
| **[ExDDV: A New Dataset for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14421v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever growing realism and quality of generated videos makes it increasingly harder for humans to spot deepfake content, who need to rely more and more on automatic deepfake detectors. However, deepfake detectors are also prone to errors, and their decisions are not explainable, leaving humans vulnerable to deepfake-based fraud and misinformation. To this end, we introduce ExDDV, the first dataset and benchmark for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video. ExDDV comprises around 5.4K real and deepfake videos that are manually annotated with text descriptions (to explain the artifacts) and clicks (to point out the artifacts). We evaluate a number of vision-language models on ExDDV, performing experiments with various fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. Our results show that text and click supervision are both required to develop robust explainable models for deepfake videos, which are able to localize and describe the observed artifacts. Our novel dataset and code to reproduce the results are available at https://github.com/vladhondru25/ExDDV.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/vladhondru25/ExDDV) |
