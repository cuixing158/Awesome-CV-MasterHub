| **[HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling with Safety Meta Token for Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> | [Code Link](https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe) |
| **[FingerVeinSyn-5M: A Million-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Finger Vein Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03635v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in finger vein recognition is the lack of large-scale public datasets. Existing datasets contain few identities and limited samples per finger, restricting the advancement of deep learning-based methods. To address this, we introduce FVeinSyn, a synthetic generator capable of producing diverse finger vein patterns with rich intra-class variations. Using FVeinSyn, we created FingerVeinSyn-5M -- the largest available finger vein dataset -- containing 5 million samples from 50,000 unique fingers, each with 100 variations including shift, rotation, scale, roll, varying exposure levels, skin scattering blur, optical blur, and motion blur. FingerVeinSyn-5M is also the first to offer fully annotated finger vein images, supporting deep learning applications in this field. Models pretrained on FingerVeinSyn-5M and fine-tuned with minimal real data achieve an average 53.91\% performance gain across multiple benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/EvanWang98/FingerVeinSyn-5M.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/EvanWang98/FingerVeinSyn-5M) |
| **[A Large-Scale Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03583v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation is a complex and challenging task that integrates the paradigms of computer vision and natural language processing. Existing datasets for RRSIS suffer from critical limitations in resolution, scene diversity, and category coverage, which hinders the generalization and real-world applicability of refer segmentation models. To facilitate the development of this field, we introduce NWPU-Refer, the largest and most diverse RRSIS dataset to date, comprising 15,003 high-resolution images (1024-2048px) spanning 30+ countries with 49,745 annotated targets supporting single-object, multi-object, and non-object segmentation scenarios. Additionally, we propose the Multi-scale Referring Segmentation Network (MRSNet), a novel framework tailored for the unique demands of RRSIS. MRSNet introduces two key innovations: (1) an Intra-scale Feature Interaction Module (IFIM) that captures fine-grained details within each encoder stage, and (2) a Hierarchical Feature Interaction Module (HFIM) to enable seamless cross-scale feature fusion, preserving spatial integrity while enhancing discriminative power. Extensive experiments conducte on the proposed NWPU-Refer dataset demonstrate that MRSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/CVer-Yang/NWPU-Refer.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/CVer-Yang/NWPU-Refer) |
| **[STORM: Benchmarking Visual Rating of MLLMs with a Comprehensive Ordinal Regression Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01738v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual rating is an essential capability of artificial intelligence (AI) for multi-dimensional quantification of visual content, primarily applied in ordinal regression (OR) tasks such as image quality assessment, facial age estimation, and medical image grading. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating. STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better fine-tuning strategies. The STORM dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models are available on the following webpage to support further research in this area. Datasets and codes are released on the project page: https://storm-bench.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>underreview of NIPS2025 D&B track</p></details> | [Code Link](https://storm-bench.github.io/) |
| **[Disentangling Likes and Dislikes in Personalized Generative Explainable Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13248v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on explainable recommendation generally frames the task as a standard text generation problem, and evaluates models simply based on the textual similarity between the predicted and ground-truth explanations. However, this approach fails to consider one crucial aspect of the systems: whether their outputs accurately reflect the users' (post-purchase) sentiments, i.e., whether and why they would like and/or dislike the recommended items. To shed light on this issue, we introduce new datasets and evaluation methods that focus on the users' sentiments. Specifically, we construct the datasets by explicitly extracting users' positive and negative opinions from their post-purchase reviews using an LLM, and propose to evaluate systems based on whether the generated explanations 1) align well with the users' sentiments, and 2) accurately identify both positive and negative opinions of users on the target items. We benchmark several recent models on our datasets and demonstrate that achieving strong performance on existing metrics does not ensure that the generated explanations align well with the users' sentiments. Lastly, we find that existing models can provide more sentiment-aware explanations when the users' (predicted) ratings for the target items are directly fed into the models as input. The datasets and benchmark implementation are available at: https://github.com/jchanxtarov/sent_xrec.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation at The Web Conference (WWW) 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/jchanxtarov/sent_xrec) |
| **[RDB2G-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Automatic Graph Modeling of Relational Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01360v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases (RDBs) are composed of interconnected tables, where relationships between them are defined through foreign keys. Recent research on applying machine learning to RDBs has explored graph-based representations of RDBs, where rows of tables are modeled as nodes, and foreign key relationships are modeled as edges. RDB-to-graph modeling helps capture cross-table dependencies, ultimately leading to enhanced performance across diverse tasks. However, there are numerous ways to model RDBs as graphs, and performance varies significantly depending on the chosen graph model. In our analysis, applying a common heuristic rule for graph modeling leads to up to a 10% drop in performance compared to the best-performing graph model, which remains non-trivial to identify. To foster research on intelligent RDB-to-graph modeling, we introduce RDB2G-Bench, the first benchmark framework for evaluating such methods. We construct extensive datasets covering 5 real-world RDBs and 12 predictive tasks, resulting in around 50k graph-performance pairs for efficient and reproducible evaluations. Thanks to our precomputed datasets, we were able to benchmark 9 automatic RDB-to-graph modeling methods on the 12 tasks over 600x faster than on-the-fly evaluation, which requires repeated model training. Our analysis of the datasets and benchmark results reveals key structural patterns affecting graph model effectiveness, along with practical implications for effective graph modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and datasets are in https://github.com/chlehdwon/RDB2G-Bench</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/chlehdwon/RDB2G-Bench) |
| **[XYZ-IBD: High-precision Bin-picking Dataset for Object 6D Pose Estimation Capturing Real-world Industrial Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00599v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research. The dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://xyz-ibd.github.io/XYZ-IBD/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://xyz-ibd.github.io/XYZ-IBD) |
| **[EgoExOR: An Ego-Exo-Centric Operating Room Dataset for Surgical Activity Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24287v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating rooms (ORs) demand precise coordination among surgeons, nurses, and equipment in a fast-paced, occlusion-heavy environment, necessitating advanced perception models to enhance safety and efficiency. Existing datasets either provide partial egocentric views or sparse exocentric multi-view context, but do not explore the comprehensive combination of both. We introduce EgoExOR, the first OR dataset and accompanying benchmark to fuse first-person and third-person perspectives. Spanning 94 minutes (84,553 frames at 15 FPS) of two emulated spine procedures, Ultrasound-Guided Needle Insertion and Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery, EgoExOR integrates egocentric data (RGB, gaze, hand tracking, audio) from wearable glasses, exocentric RGB and depth from RGB-D cameras, and ultrasound imagery. Its detailed scene graph annotations, covering 36 entities and 22 relations (568,235 triplets), enable robust modeling of clinical interactions, supporting tasks like action recognition and human-centric perception. We evaluate the surgical scene graph generation performance of two adapted state-of-the-art models and offer a new baseline that explicitly leverages EgoExOR's multimodal and multi-perspective signals. This new dataset and benchmark set a new foundation for OR perception, offering a rich, multimodal resource for next-generation clinical perception.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we introduce REDDIX-NET, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed for moderating online sexual services and going beyond traditional NSFW filters. The dataset is derived from thousands of web-scraped NSFW posts on Reddit and categorizes users into six behavioral classes reflecting different service offerings and user intentions. We evaluate the classification performance of state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4, LlaMA 3.3-70B-Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Mistral 8x7B, Qwen 2.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Haiku) using advanced quantitative metrics, finding promising results with models like GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Beyond classification, we conduct sentiment and comment analysis, leveraging LLM and PLM-based approaches and metadata extraction to uncover behavioral and temporal patterns. These analyses reveal peak engagement times and distinct user interaction styles across categories. Our findings provide critical insights into AI-driven moderation and enforcement, offering a scalable framework for platforms to combat online prostitution and associated harms.</p></details> | 29 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[VME: A Satellite Imagery Dataset and Benchmark for Detecting Vehicles in the Middle East and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22353v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vehicles in satellite images is crucial for traffic management, urban planning, and disaster response. However, current models struggle with real-world diversity, particularly across different regions. This challenge is amplified by geographic bias in existing datasets, which often focus on specific areas and overlook regions like the Middle East. To address this gap, we present the Vehicles in the Middle East (VME) dataset, designed explicitly for vehicle detection in high-resolution satellite images from Middle Eastern countries. Sourced from Maxar, the VME dataset spans 54 cities across 12 countries, comprising over 4,000 image tiles and more than 100,000 vehicles, annotated using both manual and semi-automated methods. Additionally, we introduce the largest benchmark dataset for Car Detection in Satellite Imagery (CDSI), combining images from multiple sources to enhance global car detection. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on existing datasets perform poorly on Middle Eastern images, while the VME dataset significantly improves detection accuracy in this region. Moreover, state-of-the-art models trained on CDSI achieve substantial improvements in global car detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pearl: A Multimodal Culturally-Aware Arabic Instruction Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21979v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream large vision-language models (LVLMs) inherently encode cultural biases, highlighting the need for diverse multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce Pearl, a large-scale Arabic multimodal dataset and benchmark explicitly designed for cultural understanding. Constructed through advanced agentic workflows and extensive human-in-the-loop annotations by 45 annotators from across the Arab world, Pearl comprises over K multimodal examples spanning ten culturally significant domains covering all Arab countries. We further provide two robust evaluation benchmarks Pearl and Pearl-Lite along with a specialized subset Pearl-X explicitly developed to assess nuanced cultural variations. Comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art open and proprietary LVLMs demonstrate that reasoning-centric instruction alignment substantially improves models' cultural grounding compared to conventional scaling methods. Pearl establishes a foundational resource for advancing culturally-informed multimodal modeling research.

| **[ImgEdit: A Unified Image Editing Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20275v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity text-to-image generation. However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models.

Specifically, we propose the first Object-agnostic State Classification (OaSC) method that infers the state of a certain object without relying on the knowledge or the estimation of the object class. In that direction, we capitalize on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for structuring and organizing knowledge, which, in combination with visual information, enable the inference of the states of objects in object/state pairs that have not been encountered in the method's training set. A series of experiments investigate the performance of the proposed method in various settings, against several hypotheses and in comparison with state of the art approaches for object attribute classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge of an object class is not decisive for the prediction of its state. Moreover, the proposed OaSC method outperforms existing methods in all datasets and benchmarks by a great margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors' version of the paper published at IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025.

| **[RGC-Bent: A Novel Dataset for Bent Radio Galaxy Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19249v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning dataset tailored for the classification of bent radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) in astronomical observations. Bent radio AGN, distinguished by their curved jet structures, provide critical insights into galaxy cluster dynamics, interactions within the intracluster medium, and the broader physics of AGN. Despite their astrophysical significance, the classification of bent radio AGN remains a challenge due to the scarcity of specialized datasets and benchmarks. To address this, we present a dataset, derived from a well-recognized radio astronomy survey, that is designed to support the classification of NAT (Narrow-Angle Tail) and WAT (Wide-Angle Tail) categories, along with detailed data processing steps. We further evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on the dataset, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer-based architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced machine learning models in classifying bent radio AGN, with ConvNeXT achieving the highest F1-scores for both NAT and WAT sources. By sharing this dataset and benchmarks, we aim to facilitate the advancement of research in AGN classification, galaxy cluster environments and galaxy evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, Accepted In ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing MMLU datasets primarily focus on high-resource languages such as English, which leaves low-resource languages like Bengali underrepresented. In this paper, we introduce BnMMLU, a benchmark to evaluate the multitask language understanding capabilities of Bengali in language models. The dataset spans 23 domains, including science, humanities, mathematics and general knowledge and is structured in a multiple-choice format to assess factual knowledge, application-based problem-solving and reasoning abilities of language models. It consists of 138,949 question-option pairs. We benchmark several proprietary and open-source large language models (LLMs) on the BnMMLU test set. Additionally, we annotate the test set with three cognitive categories-factual knowledge, procedural application and reasoning-to gain deeper insights into model strengths and weaknesses across various cognitive tasks. The results reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting the need for improved pre-training and fine-tuning strategies tailored to Bengali data. We release the dataset and benchmark results to facilitate further research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables; Code & dataset available at https://github.com/samanjoy2/bnmmlu</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/samanjoy2/bnmmlu) |

It utilizes pretraining multimodal foundation models to generate infinite unique photo-realistic scene variants that adhere to real-world semantics and daily commonsense for the training and the evaluation of navigation agents, accompanied with a plugin for generating object navigation task episodes compatible to the Habitat simulator. In addition, we offer two pre-generated object navigation task datasets, SD-OVON-3k and SD-OVON-10k, comprising respectively about 3k and 10k episodes of the open-vocabulary object navigation task, derived from the SD-OVON-Scenes dataset with 2.5k photo-realistic scans of real-world environments and the SD-OVON-Objects dataset with 0.9k manually inspected scanned and artist-created manipulatable object models. Unlike prior datasets limited to static environments, SD-OVON covers dynamic scenes and manipulatable objects, facilitating both real-to-sim and sim-to-real robotic applications. This approach enhances the realism of navigation tasks, the training and the evaluation of open-vocabulary object navigation agents in complex settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and datasets, we propose two baselines and evaluate them along with state-of-the-art baselines on SD-OVON-3k. The datasets, benchmark and source code are publicly available.</p></details> | Preprint. 21 pages | None |

Unlike the traditional formulation of segmentation problems that relies on fixed semantic categories or explicit prompting, RS bridges the gap between visual perception and human-like reasoning capabilities, facilitating more intuitive human-AI interaction through natural language. Our work presents the first comprehensive survey of RS for image and video processing, examining 26 state-of-the-art methods together with a review of the corresponding evaluation metrics, as well as 29 datasets and benchmarks.

However, reliable pose and depth perception remain fundamental challenges due to the transparent or low-contrast nature of the microrobots, as well as the noisy and dynamic conditions of the microscale environments in which they operate. An open dataset is crucial for enabling reproducible research, facilitating benchmarking, and accelerating the development of perception models tailored to microscale challenges. Standardised evaluation enables consistent comparison across algorithms, ensuring objective benchmarking and facilitating reproducible research. Here, we introduce the OpTical MicroRobot dataset (OTMR), the first publicly available dataset designed to support microrobot perception under the optical microscope. OTMR contains 232,881 images spanning 18 microrobot types and 176 distinct poses. We benchmarked the performance of eight deep learning models, including architectures derived via neural architecture search (NAS), on two key tasks: pose classification and depth regression. Results indicated that Vision Transformer (ViT) achieve the highest accuracy in pose classification, while depth regression benefits from deeper architectures. Additionally, increasing the size of the training dataset leads to substantial improvements across both tasks, highlighting OTMR's potential as a foundational resource for robust and generalisable microrobot perception in complex microscale environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 International Conference on Manipulation, Automation and Robotics at Small Scales (MARSS)</p></details> | None |

However, many of these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark, we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual reality, information retrieval, and other related fields.

Identity-Preserving Multi-Person Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18078v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AppealCase: A Dataset and Benchmark for Civil Case Appeal Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16514v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LegalAI have primarily focused on individual case judgment analysis, often overlooking the critical appellate process within the judicial system. Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research. To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000 pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in judicial decision-making.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, the capability of existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA, the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering, highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction, and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions: (1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward, and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional space (+6% improvement).</p></details> |  | None |

To support this, we introduce MatPredict, a dataset that combines the high-quality synthetic objects from Replica dataset with MatSynth dataset's material properties classes - to create objects with diverse material properties. We select 3D meshes of specific foreground objects and render them with different material properties. In total, we generate \textbf{18} commonly occurring objects with \textbf{14} different materials. We showcase how we provide variability in terms of lighting and camera placement for these objects. Next, we provide a benchmark for inferring material properties from visual images using these perturbed models in the scene, discussing the specific neural network models involved and their performance based on different image comparison metrics. By accurately simulating light interactions with different materials, we can enhance realism, which is crucial for training models effectively through large-scale simulations. This research aims to revolutionize perception in consumer robotics.

We frame this problem as a self-supervised learning task and present several methods to generate graph alignment datasets using synthetic random graphs and real-world graph datasets from multiple domains. For a given graph dataset, we generate a family of graph alignment datasets with increasing difficulty, allowing us to rank the performance of various architectures. Our experiments indicate that anisotropic graph neural networks outperform standard convolutional architectures. To further demonstrate the utility of the graph alignment task, we show its effectiveness for unsupervised GNN pre-training, where the learned node embeddings outperform other positional encodings on three molecular regression tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the PCQM4Mv2 dataset with significantly fewer parameters. To support reproducibility and further research, we provide an open-source Python package to generate graph alignment datasets and benchmark new GNN architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across 207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp, and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with 125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets -- Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when leveraging multimodal and structural cues. MMS-VPR facilitates future research at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial understanding, and multimodal reasoning.

However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment. Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, (ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 60K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 58,500 videos generated from 30 T2V models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2V generation and V2T interpretation capabilities. Based on AIGVE-60K, we propose LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other AIGV evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight the significance of the AIGVE-60K dataset.

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation.

| **[A Fast Kernel-based Conditional Independence test with Application to Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11085v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) testing is a powerful nonparametric method commonly employed in causal discovery tasks. Despite its flexibility and statistical reliability, cubic computational complexity limits its application to large datasets. To address this computational bottleneck, we propose \textit{FastKCI}, a scalable and parallelizable kernel-based conditional independence test that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach inspired by embarrassingly parallel inference techniques for Gaussian processes. By partitioning the dataset based on a Gaussian mixture model over the conditioning variables, FastKCI conducts local KCI tests in parallel, aggregating the results using an importance-weighted sampling scheme. Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks on real-world production data validate that FastKCI maintains the statistical power of the original KCI test while achieving substantial computational speedups. FastKCI thus represents a practical and efficient solution for conditional independence testing in causal inference on large-scale data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

Optical images offer rich textural details but are often affected by low-light, cloud-obscured, or low-resolution conditions, reducing the detection performance. SAR images are robust to weather, but suffer from speckle noise and limited semantic expressiveness. Optical and SAR images provide complementary advantages, and fusing them can significantly improve the detection accuracy. However, progress in this field is hindered by the lack of large-scale, standardized datasets. To address these challenges, we propose the first comprehensive dataset for optical-SAR fusion object detection, named Multi-resolution, Multi-polarization, Multi-scene, Multi-source SAR dataset (M4-SAR). It contains 112,184 precisely aligned image pairs and nearly one million labeled instances with arbitrary orientations, spanning six key categories. To enable standardized evaluation, we develop a unified benchmarking toolkit that integrates six state-of-the-art multi-source fusion methods. Furthermore, we propose E2E-OSDet, a novel end-to-end multi-source fusion detection framework that mitigates cross-domain discrepancies and establishes a robust baseline for future studies. Extensive experiments on M4-SAR demonstrate that fusing optical and SAR data can improve $mAP$ by 5.7\% over single-source inputs, with particularly significant gains in complex environments.

Hence, the resilience of models to such real-world perturbations is largely unquantified. To address this, we present RobustSpring, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating robustness to image corruptions for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo models. RobustSpring applies 20 different image corruptions, including noise, blur, color changes, quality degradations, and weather distortions, in a time-, stereo-, and depth-consistent manner to the high-resolution Spring dataset, creating a suite of 20,000 corrupted images that reflect challenging conditions. RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new corruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables public two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a curated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not necessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type. RobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a first-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience.

However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models.

Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized RS data sources without exposing raw data. However, there lacks a realistic federated dataset and benchmark in RS. Prior works typically rely on manually partitioned single dataset, which fail to capture the heterogeneity and scale of real-world RS data, and often use inconsistent experimental setups, hindering fair comparison. To address this gap, we propose a realistic federated RS dataset, termed FedRS. FedRS consists of eight datasets that cover various sensors and resolutions and builds 135 clients, which is representative of realistic operational scenarios. Data for each client come from the same source, exhibiting authentic federated properties such as skewed label distributions, imbalanced client data volumes, and domain heterogeneity across clients. These characteristics reflect practical challenges in federated RS and support evaluation of FL methods at scale. Based on FedRS, we implement 10 baseline FL algorithms and evaluation metrics to construct the comprehensive FedRS-Bench. The experimental results demonstrate that FL can consistently improve model performance over training on isolated data silos, while revealing performance trade-offs of different methods under varying client heterogeneity and availability conditions. We hope FedRS-Bench will accelerate research on large-scale, realistic FL in RS by providing a standardized, rich testbed and facilitating fair comparisons across future works.

| **[BihoT: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Hyperspectral Camouflaged Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12232v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral object tracking (HOT) has exhibited potential in various applications, particularly in scenes where objects are camouflaged. Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2025</p></details> | None |

While LLMs excel on general tasks, their systematic evaluation on these highly specialized, accuracy-critical, and inherently procedural texts remains limited. In this work, we present BioProBench, the first large-scale, integrated multi-task benchmark for biological protocol understanding and reasoning. While limited benchmarks have touched upon specific aspects like protocol QA, BioProBench provides a comprehensive suite of five core tasks: Protocol Question Answering, Step Ordering, Error Correction, Protocol Generation, and Protocol Reasoning, enabling a holistic evaluation of LLMs on procedural biological texts. Built upon 27K original protocols, it yields nearly 556K high-quality structured instances. We evaluate 12 mainstream open/closed-source LLMs on BioProBench. Experimental results reveal that while top models preform well on surface understanding tasks, struggle significantly with deep reasoning and structured generation tasks like ordering and generation. Furthermore, model comparisons reveal diverse performance: certain open-source models approach closed-source levels on some tasks, yet bio-specific small models lag behind general LLMs, indicating limitations on complex procedural content. Overall, our findings underscore that procedural reasoning within biological protocols represents a significant challenge for current LLMs. BioProBench serves as a standardized framework to diagnose these specific limitations and guide the development of AI systems better equipped for safely automating complex scientific procedures.

However, existing studies have relied on private datasets and simplistic degradation models. To address this gap, we introduce UFPR-SR-Plates, a novel dataset containing 10,000 tracks with 100,000 paired low and high-resolution license plate images captured under real-world conditions. We establish a benchmark using multiple sequential LR and high-resolution (HR) images per vehicle -- five of each -- and two state-of-the-art models for super-resolution of license plates. We also investigate three fusion strategies to evaluate how combining predictions from a leading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for multiple super-resolved license plates enhances overall performance. Our findings demonstrate that super-resolution significantly boosts LPR performance, with further improvements observed when applying majority vote-based fusion techniques. Specifically, the Layout-Aware and Character-Driven Network (LCDNet) model combined with the Majority Vote by Character Position (MVCP) strategy led to the highest recognition rates, increasing from 1.7% with low-resolution images to 31.1% with super-resolution, and up to 44.7% when combining OCR outputs from five super-resolved images. These findings underscore the critical role of super-resolution and temporal information in enhancing LPR accuracy under real-world, adverse conditions.

However, most assume straight light paths and therefore cannot properly handle refractive and reflective materials. Moreover, datasets specialized for these effects are limited, stymieing efforts to evaluate performance and develop suitable techniques. In this work, we introduce a synthetic RefRef dataset and benchmark for reconstructing scenes with refractive and reflective objects from posed images. Our dataset has 50 such objects of varying complexity, from single-material convex shapes to multi-material non-convex shapes, each placed in three different background types, resulting in 150 scenes. We also propose an oracle method that, given the object geometry and refractive indices, calculates accurate light paths for neural rendering, and an approach based on this that avoids these assumptions. We benchmark these against several state-of-the-art methods and show that all methods lag significantly behind the oracle, highlighting the challenges of the task and dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, temporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered significant attention in recent years. TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into low-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and temporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving data environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational concepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods, systematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized during the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source of datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical investigations.

We identify two key challenges: modality discrepancy, where existing large touch-language models often treat touch as a mere sub-modality of language, and open-ended tactile data scarcity, where current datasets lack the diversity, open-endness and complexity needed for reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SToLa, a Self-Adaptive Touch-Language framework. SToLa utilizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) to dynamically process, unify, and manage tactile and language modalities, capturing their unique characteristics. Crucially, we also present a comprehensive tactile commonsense reasoning dataset and benchmark featuring free-form questions and responses, 8 physical properties, 4 interactive characteristics, and diverse commonsense knowledge. Experiments show SToLa exhibits competitive performance compared to existing models on the PhysiCLeAR benchmark and self-constructed datasets, proving the effectiveness of the Mixture of Experts architecture in multimodal management and the performance advantages for open-scenario tactile commonsense reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering.

Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare.

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community.

This study presents UDGS-SLAM, a novel approach that eliminates the necessity of RGB-D sensors for depth estimation within Gaussian splatting framework. UDGS-SLAM employs statistical filtering to ensure local consistency of the estimated depth and jointly optimizes camera trajectory and Gaussian scene representation parameters. The proposed method achieves high-fidelity rendered images and low ATERMSE of the camera trajectory. The performance of UDGS-SLAM is rigorously evaluated using the TUM RGB-D dataset and benchmarked against several baseline methods, demonstrating superior performance across various scenarios. Additionally, an ablation study is conducted to validate design choices and investigate the impact of different network backbone encoders on system performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the integration of multimodal data, including raw waveform signals, remains underexplored in clinical decision support. Methods: We present a dataset and benchmarking protocol designed to advance multimodal decision support in emergency care. Our models utilize demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms as inputs to predict both discharge diagnoses and patient deterioration. Results: The diagnostic model achieves area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) scores above 0.8 for 609 out of 1,428 conditions, covering both cardiac (e.g., myocardial infarction) and non-cardiac (e.g., renal disease, diabetes) diagnoses. The deterioration model attains AUROC scores above 0.8 for 14 out of 15 targets, accurately predicting critical events such as cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and mortality. Conclusions: Our study highlights the positive impact of incorporating raw waveform data into decision support models, improving predictive performance. By introducing a unique, publicly available dataset and baseline models, we provide a foundation for measurable progress in AI-driven decision support for emergency care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version accepted by Computers in Biology and Medicine: 21 pages, 2 figures, code available under https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/MDS-ED, dataset available under https://physionet.org/content/multimodal-emergency-benchmark/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/MDS-ED) |
| **[REHEARSE-3D: A Multi-modal Emulated Rain Dataset for 3D Point Cloud De-raining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21699v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor degradation poses a significant challenge in autonomous driving. During heavy rainfall, the interference from raindrops can adversely affect the quality of LiDAR point clouds, resulting in, for instance, inaccurate point measurements. This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if autonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to discern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal emulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D point cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our dataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise annotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR data (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and nighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore, REHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant value not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of weather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop detection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our comprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical and deep-learning models. Upon publication, the dataset and benchmark models will be made publicly available at: https://sporsho.github.io/REHEARSE3D.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://sporsho.github.io/REHEARSE3D) |

This paper systematically reviews LLM-driven phone GUI agents, highlighting their evolution from script-based automation to intelligent, adaptive systems. We first contextualize key challenges, (i) limited generality, (ii) high maintenance overhead, and (iii) weak intent comprehension, and show how LLMs address these issues through advanced language understanding, multimodal perception, and robust decision-making. We then propose a taxonomy covering fundamental agent frameworks (single-agent, multi-agent, plan-then-act), modeling approaches (prompt engineering, training-based), and essential datasets and benchmarks. Furthermore, we detail task-specific architectures, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning strategies that bridge user intent and GUI operations. Finally, we discuss open challenges such as dataset diversity, on-device deployment efficiency, user-centric adaptation, and security concerns, offering forward-looking insights into this rapidly evolving field. By providing a structured overview and identifying pressing research gaps, this paper serves as a definitive reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness LLMs in designing scalable, user-friendly phone GUI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, Project Homepage: https://github.com/PhoneLLM/Awesome-LLM-Powered-Phone-GUI-Agents</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/PhoneLLM/Awesome-LLM-Powered-Phone-GUI-Agents) |
| **[RoboVerse: Towards a Unified Platform, Dataset and Benchmark for Scalable and Generalizable Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18904v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scaling and standardized evaluation benchmarks have driven significant advances in natural language processing and computer vision. However, robotics faces unique challenges in scaling data and establishing evaluation protocols. Collecting real-world data is resource-intensive and inefficient, while benchmarking in real-world scenarios remains highly complex. Synthetic data and simulation offer promising alternatives, yet existing efforts often fall short in data quality, diversity, and benchmark standardization. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboVerse, a comprehensive framework comprising a simulation platform, a synthetic dataset, and unified benchmarks. Our simulation platform supports multiple simulators and robotic embodiments, enabling seamless transitions between different environments. The synthetic dataset, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering, is constructed through multiple approaches. Additionally, we propose unified benchmarks for imitation learning and reinforcement learning, enabling evaluation across different levels of generalization. At the core of the simulation platform is MetaSim, an infrastructure that abstracts diverse simulation environments into a universal interface. It restructures existing simulation environments into a simulator-agnostic configuration system, as well as an API aligning different simulator functionalities, such as launching simulation environments, loading assets with initial states, stepping the physics engine, etc. This abstraction ensures interoperability and extensibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RoboVerse enhances the performance of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world model learning, and sim-to-real transfer. These results validate the reliability of our dataset and benchmarks, establishing RoboVerse as a robust solution for advancing robot learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[8-Calves Image dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13777v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the 8-Calves dataset, a benchmark for evaluating object detection and identity preservation in occlusion-rich, temporally consistent environments. Comprising a 1-hour video (67,760 frames) of eight Holstein Friesian calves with unique coat patterns and 900 static frames, the dataset emphasizes real-world challenges like prolonged occlusions, motion blur, and pose variation. By fine-tuning 28 object detectors (YOLO variants, transformers) and evaluating 23 pretrained backbones (ResNet, ConvNextV2, ViTs), we expose critical architectural trade-offs: smaller models (e.g., ConvNextV2 Nano, 15.6M parameters) excel in efficiency and retrieval accuracy, while pure vision transformers lag in occlusion-heavy settings. The dataset's structured design-fixed camera views, natural motion, and verified identities-provides a reproducible testbed for object detection challenges (mAP50:95: 56.5-66.4%), bridging synthetic simplicity and domain-specific complexity. The dataset and benchmark code are all publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tonyFang04/8-calves. Limitations include partial labeling and detector bias, addressed in later sections.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[A dataset and benchmark for hospital course summarization with adapted large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05720v5)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brief hospital course (BHC) summaries are clinical documents that summarize a patient's hospital stay. While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DataS^3: Dataset Subset Selection for Specialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16277v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world machine learning (ML) applications (e.g. detecting broken bones in x-ray images, detecting species in camera traps), in practice models need to perform well on specific deployments (e.g. a specific hospital, a specific national park) rather than the domain broadly. However, deployments often have imbalanced, unique data distributions. Discrepancy between the training distribution and the deployment distribution can lead to suboptimal performance, highlighting the need to select deployment-specialized subsets from the available training data. We formalize dataset subset selection for specialization (DS3): given a training set drawn from a general distribution and a (potentially unlabeled) query set drawn from the desired deployment-specific distribution, the goal is to select a subset of the training data that optimizes deployment performance. We introduce DataS^3; the first dataset and benchmark designed specifically for the DS3 problem. DataS^3 encompasses diverse real-world application domains, each with a set of distinct deployments to specialize in. We conduct a comprehensive study evaluating algorithms from various families--including coresets, data filtering, and data curation--on DataS^3, and find that general-distribution methods consistently fail on deployment-specific tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of manually curated (deployment-specific) expert subsets that outperform training on all available data with accuracy gains up to 51.3 percent. Our benchmark highlights the critical role of tailored dataset curation in enhancing performance and training efficiency on deployment-specific distributions, which we posit will only become more important as global, public datasets become available across domains and ML models are deployed in the real world.</p></details> |  | None |

As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, they show great potential for processing IP tasks, enabling more efficient analysis, understanding, and generation of IP-related content. However, existing datasets and benchmarks either focus narrowly on patents or cover limited aspects of the IP field, lacking alignment with real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive IP task taxonomy and a large, diverse bilingual benchmark, IPBench, covering 8 IP mechanisms and 20 tasks. This benchmark is designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world intellectual property applications, encompassing both understanding and generation. We benchmark 16 LLMs, ranging from general-purpose to domain-specific models, and find that even the best-performing model achieves only 75.8% accuracy, revealing substantial room for improvement. Notably, open-source IP and law-oriented models lag behind closed-source general-purpose models. We publicly release all data and code of IPBench and will continue to update it with additional IP-related tasks to better reflect real-world challenges in the intellectual property domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>89 pa...</summary><p>89 pages, 75 figures, 55 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Understanding Camera Motions in Any Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15376v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find, for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two. Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding camera motions in any video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project site: https://linzhiqiu.github.io/papers/camerabench/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://linzhiqiu.github.io/papers) |

In the era of rapidly growing mutimodal content and social media, MCR is particularly crucial for interpreting user interactions and bridging text-visual references to improve communication and personalization. However, MCR research for real-world dialogues remains unexplored due to the lack of sufficient data resources.To address this gap, we introduce TikTalkCoref, the first Chinese multimodal coreference dataset for social media in real-world scenarios, derived from the popular Douyin short-video platform. This dataset pairs short videos with corresponding textual dialogues from user comments and includes manually annotated coreference clusters for both person mentions in the text and the coreferential person head regions in the corresponding video frames. We also present an effective benchmark approach for MCR, focusing on the celebrity domain, and conduct extensive experiments on our dataset, providing reliable benchmark results for this newly constructed dataset. We will release the TikTalkCoref dataset to facilitate future research on MCR for real-world social media dialogues.</p></details> |  | None |

WildlifeReID-10k covers diverse animal species and poses significant challenges for SoTA methods, ensuring fair and robust evaluation through its time-aware and similarity-aware split protocol. The latter is designed to address the common issue of training-to-test data leakage caused by visually similar images appearing in both training and test sets. The WildlifeReID-10k dataset and benchmark are publicly available on Kaggle, along with strong baselines for both closed-set and open-set evaluation, enabling fair, transparent, and standardized evaluation of not just multi-species animal re-identification models.</p></details> |  | None |

Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 tables, 18 figures</p></details> | None |

A digital twin of a 3D object is a highly detailed, virtually indistinguishable representation of a physical object, accurately capturing its shape, appearance, physical properties, and other attributes. Recent advances in neural-based 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering have significantly improved the quality of 3D object reconstruction. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of a large-scale, digital twin quality real-world dataset and benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of different reconstruction methods, as well as improve reconstruction quality through training or fine-tuning. Moreover, to democratize 3D digital twin creation, it is essential to integrate creation techniques with next-generation egocentric computing platforms, such as AR glasses. Currently, there is no dataset available to evaluate 3D object reconstruction using egocentric captured images. To address these gaps, the DTC dataset features 2,000 scanned digital twin-quality 3D objects, along with image sequences captured under different lighting conditions using DSLR cameras and egocentric AR glasses. This dataset establishes the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for 3D digital twin creation tasks, offering a robust foundation for comparing and improving existing reconstruction methods. The DTC dataset is already released at https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/ and we will also make the baseline evaluations open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to CVPR 2025 highlights</p></details> | None |

However, many generated images still suffer from issues related to perceptual quality and text-image alignment. Given the high cost and inefficiency of manual evaluation, an automatic metric that aligns with human preferences is desirable. To this end, we present EvalMi-50K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating large-multimodal image generation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 2,100 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, and (ii) large-scale human-preference annotations, including 100K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 50K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 50,400 images generated from 24 T2I models. Based on EvalMi-50K, we propose LMM4LMM, an LMM-based metric for evaluating large multimodal T2I generation from multiple dimensions including perception, text-image correspondence, and task-specific accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that LMM4LMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EvalMi-50K, and exhibits strong generalization ability on other AI-generated image evaluation benchmark datasets, manifesting the generality of both the EvalMi-50K dataset and LMM4LMM metric.

However, its application has predominantly been confined to imaging modalities such as panoramic radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography, with limited focus on auxiliary analysis specifically targeting Periapical Radiographs (PR). PR are the most extensively utilized imaging modality in endodontics and periodontics due to their capability to capture detailed local lesions at a low cost. Nevertheless, challenges such as resolution limitations and artifacts complicate the annotation and recognition of PR, leading to a scarcity of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality PR analysis datasets. This scarcity has somewhat impeded the advancement of DL applications in PR analysis. In this paper, we present PRAD-10K, a dataset for PR analysis. PRAD-10K comprises 10,000 clinical periapical radiograph images, with pixel-level annotations provided by professional dentists for nine distinct anatomical structures, lesions, and artificial restorations or medical devices, We also include classification labels for images with typical conditions or lesions. Furthermore, we introduce a DL network named PRNet to establish benchmarks for PR segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that PRNet surpasses previous state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models on the PRAD-10K dataset.

Although other spectral bands like near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception in such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over NIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently incorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce the RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000 synchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a subset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset of challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging through experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation. Our experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework significantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches, particularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We anticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral imaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://yxbian23.github.io/project/video-painter</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yxbian23.github.io/project) |

We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional frame-based cameras, widely used in UAV-based inspections, often struggle to capture defects under low or dynamic lighting conditions. In contrast, Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), or event-based cameras, excel in such scenarios by minimizing motion blur, enhancing power efficiency, and maintaining high-quality imaging across diverse lighting conditions without saturation or information loss. Despite these advantages, existing research lacks studies exploring the feasibility of using DVS for detecting civil structural defects.Moreover, there is no dedicated event-based dataset tailored for this purpose. Addressing this gap, this study introduces the first event-based civil infrastructure defect detection dataset, capturing defective surfaces as a spatio-temporal event stream using DVS.In addition to event-based data, the dataset includes grayscale intensity image frames captured simultaneously using an Active Pixel Sensor (APS). Both data types were collected using the DAVIS346 camera, which integrates DVS and APS sensors.The dataset focuses on two types of defects: cracks and spalling, and includes data from both field and laboratory environments. The field dataset comprises 318 recording sequences,documenting 458 distinct cracks and 121 distinct spalling instances.The laboratory dataset includes 362 recording sequences, covering 220 distinct cracks and 308 spalling instances.Four realtime object detection models were evaluated on it to validate the dataset effectiveness.The results demonstrate the dataset robustness in enabling accurate defect detection and classification,even under challenging lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>A jou...</summary><p>A journal paper which submitted to Sage SHM journa and it is under review currently. consist of 25 pages.

| **[The Human Robot Social Interaction (HSRI) Dataset: Benchmarking Foundational Models' Social Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13898v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our work aims to advance the social reasoning of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) agents in real-world social interactions. Recently, language models (LMs) and foundational models (FMs) are being utilized as automatic evaluators of human-AI interactions with the goal of eventually being used to improve the policy of the AI agent. To enable further research in this direction, we introduce a large-scale real-world Human Robot Social Interaction (HSRI) Dataset to benchmark the capabilities of LMs and FMs to identify and reason about social interactions, specifically with regard to robot social errors and competencies . Our dataset consists of 400 real-world human social robot interaction videos and over 10K annotations, detailing the robot's social errors, competencies, rationale, and corrective actions, capturing unique aspects of human-AI interaction only present in real-world interactions. To further assess AI models' ability to reason about social interactions, we propose eight new benchmark tasks for evaluating centered around whether AI models can (1) evaluate social interactions via detecting social errors and competencies, (2) identify the explanatory factors associated to errors and competencies, (3) understand the flow of real-world social interactions, and (4) provide reasons and corrective actions for social errors. Human studies and experiments with modern LMs and FMs reveal that current models struggle with these tasks, demonstrating that our dataset and benchmark provides a step forward towards socially intelligent AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  | None |

To expand the scope of clinical applications, we formulate a novel setting, "OCT-enhanced disease recognition from fundus images", that allows for the use of unpaired multi-modal data during the training phase and relies on the widespread fundus photographs for testing. To benchmark this setting, we present the first large multi-modal multi-class dataset for eye disease diagnosis, MultiEYE, and propose an OCT-assisted Conceptual Distillation Approach (OCT-CoDA), which employs semantically rich concepts to extract disease-related knowledge from OCT images and leverage them into the fundus model. Specifically, we regard the image-concept relation as a link to distill useful knowledge from the OCT teacher model to the fundus student model, which considerably improves the diagnostic performance based on fundus images and formulates the cross-modal knowledge transfer into an explainable process. Through extensive experiments on the multi-disease classification task, our proposed OCT-CoDA demonstrates remarkable results and interpretability, showing great potential for clinical application.

In this work, we present VietMed - a Vietnamese speech recognition dataset in the medical domain comprising 16h of labeled medical speech, 1000h of unlabeled medical speech and 1200h of unlabeled general-domain speech. To our best knowledge, VietMed is by far the world's largest public medical speech recognition dataset in 7 aspects: total duration, number of speakers, diseases, recording conditions, speaker roles, unique medical terms and accents. VietMed is also by far the largest public Vietnamese speech dataset in terms of total duration. Additionally, we are the first to present a medical ASR dataset covering all ICD-10 disease groups and all accents within a country. Moreover, we release the first public large-scale pre-trained models for Vietnamese ASR, w2v2-Viet and XLSR-53-Viet, along with the first public large-scale fine-tuned models for medical ASR. Even without any medical data in unsupervised pre-training, our best pre-trained model XLSR-53-Viet generalizes very well to the medical domain by outperforming state-of-the-art XLSR-53, from 51.8% to 29.6% WER on test set (a relative reduction of more than 40%).

To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multi-Modal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark. We also propose our baseline method Vehicle-to-Vehicle Multi-Modal Large Language Model (V2V-LLM), which uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and answer various types of driving-related questions: grounding, notable object identification, and planning. Experimental results show that our proposed V2V-LLM can be a promising unified model architecture for performing various tasks in cooperative autonomous driving, and outperforms other baseline methods that use different fusion approaches. Our work also creates a new research direction that can improve the safety of future autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released to the public to facilitate open-source research in this field.

However, current research primarily focuses on the basic alignment issues of ego-exo data from different cameras, rather than collecting data from the imitator's perspective, which is inconsistent with the high-level cognitive process. To advance this research, we introduce a novel large-scale egocentric dataset, called EgoMe, which towards following the process of human imitation learning via the imitator's egocentric view in the real world. Our dataset includes 7902 paired exo-ego videos (totaling15804 videos) spanning diverse daily behaviors in various real-world scenarios. For each video pair, one video captures an exocentric view of the imitator observing the demonstrator's actions, while the other captures an egocentric view of the imitator subsequently following those actions. Notably, EgoMe uniquely incorporates exo-ego eye gaze, other multi-modal sensor IMU data and different-level annotations for assisting in establishing correlations between observing and imitating process. We further provide a suit of challenging benchmarks for fully leveraging this data resource and promoting the robot imitation learning research. Extensive analysis demonstrates significant advantages over existing datasets.

The ability to identify shapes regardless of orientation, texture, or context, and to recognize textures independently of their associated objects, is essential for general visual understanding of the world. We introduce the Large Shape & Textures dataset (LAS&T), a giant collection of diverse shapes and textures automatically extracted from real-world images. This dataset is used to evaluate how effectively leading Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) understand shapes, textures, and materials in both 2D and 3D scenes. For shape recognition, we test models' ability to match identical shapes that differ in orientation, texture, color, or environment. Our results show that LVLMs' shape identification capabilities remain significantly below human performance. Single alterations (orientation, texture) cause minor decreases in matching accuracy, while multiple changes precipitate dramatic drops. LVLMs appear to rely predominantly on high-level and semantic features and struggle with abstract shapes lacking clear class associations. For texture and material recognition, we evaluate models' ability to identify identical textures and materials across different objects and environments. Interestingly, leading LVLMs approach human-level performance in recognizing materials in 3D scenes, yet substantially underperform humans when identifying simpler 2D textures. The LAS&T dataset and benchmark, the largest and most diverse resource for shape and texture evaluation, is freely available with generation and testing scripts.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning.

They have also made progress in the ability to converse with users in real-time using audio input. This raises the question: have we reached the point where AI models, connected to a camera and microphone, can converse with users in real-time about scenes and events that are unfolding live in front of the camera? This has been a long-standing goal in AI and is a prerequisite for real-world AI assistants and humanoid robots to interact with humans in everyday situations. In this work, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark, the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD), which allows us to assess the extent to which existing models can support these abilities, and to what degree these capabilities can be instilled through fine-tuning. The dataset is based on a simple question-answering setup, where users ask questions that the system has to answer, in real-time, based on the camera and audio input. We show that existing models fall far behind human performance on this task, and we identify the main sources for the performance gap. However, we also show that for many of the required perceptual skills, fine-tuning on this form of data can significantly reduce this gap.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, variations in vision-aware language vocabulary data used for open-vocabulary learning can lead to unfair and unreliable evaluations. Recent evaluation methods have attempted to address this issue by incorporating object properties or adding locations and characteristics to the captions. Nevertheless, since these properties and locations depend on the specific details of the images instead of classes, detectors can not make accurate predictions without precise descriptions provided through human annotation. This paper introduces 3F-OVD, a novel task that extends supervised fine-grained object detection to the open-vocabulary setting. Our task is intuitive and challenging, requiring a deep understanding of Fine-grained captions and careful attention to Fine-grained details in images in order to accurately detect Fine-grained objects. Additionally, due to the scarcity of qualified fine-grained object detection datasets, we have created a new dataset, NEU-171K, tailored for both supervised and open-vocabulary settings. We benchmark state-of-the-art object detectors on our dataset for both settings. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective post-processing technique.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration.

However, the lack of datasets and benchmarks in the public domain prevents the development and fair evaluation of LLM solutions. This paper highlights our latest advances in open datasets and benchmarks from three perspectives: (1) RTLLM 2.0, an updated benchmark assessing LLM's capability in design RTL generation. The benchmark is augmented to 50 hand-crafted designs. Each design provides the design description, test cases, and a correct RTL code. (2) AssertEval, an open-source benchmark assessing the LLM's assertion generation capabilities for RTL verification. The benchmark includes 18 designs, each providing specification, signal definition, and correct RTL code. (3) RTLCoder-Data, an extended open-source dataset with 80K instruction-code data samples. Moreover, we propose a new verification-based method to verify the functionality correctness of training data samples. Based on this technique, we further release a dataset with 7K verified high-quality samples. These three studies are integrated into one framework, providing off-the-shelf support for the development and evaluation of LLMs for RTL code generation and verification. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that LLM performance can be boosted by enlarging the training dataset, improving data quality, and improving the training scheme.</p></details> | ICCAD'24 | None |

However, deepfake detectors are also prone to errors, and their decisions are not explainable, leaving humans vulnerable to deepfake-based fraud and misinformation. To this end, we introduce ExDDV, the first dataset and benchmark for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video. ExDDV comprises around 5.4K real and deepfake videos that are manually annotated with text descriptions (to explain the artifacts) and clicks (to point out the artifacts). We evaluate a number of vision-language models on ExDDV, performing experiments with various fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. Our results show that text and click supervision are both required to develop robust explainable models for deepfake videos, which are able to localize and describe the observed artifacts.

Aim: We aim to systematically synthesize the use, rationale, contexts, usability, and future challenges of GenAI in software architecture. Method: We performed a multivocal literature review (MLR), analyzing peer-reviewed and gray literature, identifying current practices, models, adoption contexts, and reported challenges, extracting themes via open coding. Results: Our review identified significant adoption of GenAI for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. OpenAI GPT models are predominantly applied, and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieved-augmented generation (RAG). GenAI has been applied mostly to initial stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the dominant targets. However, rigorous testing of GenAI outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks. Conclusions: GenAI shows significant potential in software design, but several challenges remain on its path to greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architecture-specific datasets and benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical possibilities and practical use.</p></details> |  | None |

While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery offers inherently haze-free reference information for large-scale scenes, existing SAR-guided dehazing approaches face two critical limitations: the integration of SAR information often diminishes the quality of haze-free regions, and the instability of feature quality further exacerbates cross-modal domain shift. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DehazeMamba, a novel SAR-guided dehazing network built on a progressive haze decoupling fusion strategy. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a Haze Perception and Decoupling Module (HPDM) that dynamically identifies haze-affected regions through optical-SAR difference analysis, and a Progressive Fusion Module (PFM) that mitigates domain shift through a two-stage fusion process based on feature quality assessment. To facilitate research in this domain, we present MRSHaze, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 8,000 pairs of temporally synchronized, precisely geo-registered SAR-optical images with high resolution and diverse haze conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DehazeMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 0.73 dB improvement in PSNR and substantial enhancements in downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.

Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning.

The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes.

However, current work typically relies on prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often leads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex agent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve model performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization towards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic environmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous recent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents for complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these methods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches, categorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first focus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based optimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies, analyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning techniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, we briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior through prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval. Finally, we summarize the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation and tuning, review key applications of LLM-based agents, and discuss major challenges and promising future directions.

Testing datasets, especially high-quality image/video datasets are desirable for the justified evaluation of coding-related research, practical applications, and standardization activities. We put forward a test dataset namely USTC-TD, which has been successfully adopted in the practical end-to-end image/video coding challenge of the IEEE International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP) in 2022 and 2023. USTC-TD contains 40 images at 4K spatial resolution and 10 video sequences at 1080p spatial resolution, featuring various content due to the diverse environmental factors (e.g. scene type, texture, motion, view) and the designed imaging factors (e.g. illumination, lens, shadow). We quantitatively evaluate USTC-TD on different image/video features (spatial, temporal, color, lightness), and compare it with the previous image/video test datasets, which verifies its excellent compensation for the shortcomings of existing datasets. We also evaluate both classic standardized and recently learned image/video coding schemes on USTC-TD using objective quality metrics (PSNR, MS-SSIM, VMAF) and subjective quality metric (MOS), providing an extensive benchmark for these evaluated schemes. Based on the characteristics and specific design of the proposed test dataset, we analyze the benchmark performance and shed light on the future research and development of image/video coding.

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and overcoming occlusions, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous driving. In recent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged; however, these datasets primarily focus on cameras and LiDAR, neglecting 4D Radar, a sensor used in single-vehicle autonomous driving to provide robust perception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap created by the absence of 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we present V2X-Radar, the first large-scale, real-world multi-modal dataset featuring 4D Radar. V2X-Radar dataset is collected using a connected vehicle platform and an intelligent roadside unit equipped with 4D Radar, LiDAR, and multi-view cameras. The collected data encompasses sunny and rainy weather conditions, spanning daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as various typical challenging scenarios. The dataset consists of 20K LiDAR frames, 40K camera images, and 20K 4D Radar data, including 350K annotated boxes across five categories. To support various research domains, we have established V2X-Radar-C for cooperative perception, V2X-Radar-I for roadside perception, and V2X-Radar-V for single-vehicle perception. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive benchmarks across these three sub-datasets. We will release all datasets and benchmark codebase at http://openmpd.com/column/V2X-Radar and https://github.com/yanglei18/V2X-Radar.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/yanglei18/V2X-Radar) |

REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences. Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.</p></details> |  | None |

One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model.

However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets. Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps. To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics. We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information. By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation. We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA. Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels. Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively.

| **[ATRNet-STAR: A Large Dataset and Benchmark Towards Remote Sensing Object Recognition in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13354v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The absence of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality datasets for Synthetic Aperture Radar Automatic Target Recognition (SAR ATR) has significantly hindered the application of rapidly advancing deep learning techniques, which hold huge potential to unlock new capabilities in this field. This is primarily because collecting large volumes of diverse target samples from SAR images is prohibitively expensive, largely due to privacy concerns, the characteristics of microwave radar imagery perception, and the need for specialized expertise in data annotation. Throughout the history of SAR ATR research, there have been only a number of small datasets, mainly including targets like ships, airplanes, buildings, etc. There is only one vehicle dataset MSTAR collected in the 1990s, which has been a valuable source for SAR ATR. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a large-scale, new dataset named ATRNet-STAR with 40 different vehicle categories collected under various realistic imaging conditions and scenes. It marks a substantial advancement in dataset scale and diversity, comprising over 190,000 well-annotated samples, 10 times larger than its predecessor, the famous MSTAR. Building such a large dataset is a challenging task, and the data collection scheme will be detailed. Secondly, we illustrate the value of ATRNet-STAR via extensively evaluating the performance of 15 representative methods with 7 different experimental settings on challenging classification and detection benchmarks derived from the dataset. Finally, based on our extensive experiments, we identify valuable insights for SAR ATR and discuss potential future research directions in this field. We hope that the scale, diversity, and benchmark of ATRNet-STAR can significantly facilitate the advancement of SAR ATR.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures; ATRNet-STAR: https://github.com/waterdisappear/ATRNet-STAR</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/waterdisappear/ATRNet-STAR) |

With the increasing use of machine learning, issues related to data quality have become a concern also in automated program repair research. In this position paper, we report some of the data-related issues we have come across when working with several large APR datasets and benchmarks, including, for instance, duplicates or "bogus bugs". We briefly discuss the potential impact of these problems on repair performance and propose possible remedies. We believe that more data-focused approaches could improve the performance and robustness of current and future APR systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Grounding-IQA: Multimodal Language Grounding Model for Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17237v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enables the evaluation of image quality through natural language descriptions. This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, grounding-IQA. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates the model grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed task paradigm, dataset, and benchmark facilitate the more fine-grained IQA application.

On one hand, existing networks typically employ a single type of attention mechanism, focusing on either structural or feature similarities during message passing. On the other hand, assuming that all nodes in current hypergraph models have the same level of overlap may lead to suboptimal generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework, overlap-aware meta-learning attention for hypergraph neural networks (OMA-HGNN). First, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism that integrates both structural and feature similarities. Specifically, we linearly combine their respective losses with weighted factors for the HGNN model. Second, we partition nodes into different tasks based on their diverse overlap levels and develop a multi-task Meta-Weight-Net (MWN) to determine the corresponding weighted factors. Third, we jointly train the internal MWN model with the losses from the external HGNN model and train the external model with the weighted factors from the internal model. To evaluate the effectiveness of OMA-HGNN, we conducted experiments on six real-world datasets and benchmarked its perfor-mance against nine state-of-the-art methods for node classification. The results demonstrate that OMA-HGNN excels in learning superior node representations and outperforms these baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>latex...</summary><p>latex, 45 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Aerial-ground cooperation offers a promising solution by integrating UAVs' aerial views with ground vehicles' local observations. However, progress in this emerging field has been hindered by the absence of public datasets and standardized evaluation benchmarks. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive solution for aerial-ground cooperative 3D perception through three key contributions: (1) Griffin, a large-scale multi-modal dataset featuring over 200 dynamic scenes (30k+ frames) with varied UAV altitudes (20-60m), diverse weather conditions, and occlusion-aware 3D annotations, enhanced by CARLA-AirSim co-simulation for realistic UAV dynamics; (2) A unified benchmarking framework for aerial-ground cooperative detection and tracking tasks, including protocols for evaluating communication efficiency, latency tolerance, and altitude adaptability; (3) AGILE, an instance-level intermediate fusion baseline that dynamically aligns cross-view features through query-based interaction, achieving an advantageous balance between communication overhead and perception accuracy.

This challenge is compounded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality medical imaging retrieval datasets and benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that leverages dense radiology reports to define image-wise similarity ordering at multiple granularities in a scalable and fully automatic manner. Using this approach, we construct two comprehensive medical imaging retrieval datasets: MIMIC-IR for Chest X-rays and CTRATE-IR for CT scans, providing detailed image-image ranking annotations conditioned on diverse anatomical structures. Furthermore, we develop two retrieval systems, RadIR-CXR and model-ChestCT, which demonstrate superior performance in traditional image-image and image-report retrieval tasks. These systems also enable flexible, effective image retrieval conditioned on specific anatomical structures described in text, achieving state-of-the-art results on 77 out of 78 metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Dataset and Benchmark for Shape Completion of Fruits for Agricultural Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13304v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the world population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, our agricultural production system needs to double its productivity despite a decline of human workforce in the agricultural sector. Autonomous robotic systems are one promising pathway to increase productivity by taking over labor-intensive manual tasks like fruit picking. To be effective, such systems need to monitor and interact with plants and fruits precisely, which is challenging due to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments causing, for example, strong occlusions. Thus, being able to estimate the complete 3D shapes of objects in presence of occlusions is crucial for automating operations such as fruit harvesting. In this paper, we propose the first publicly available 3D shape completion dataset for agricultural vision systems. We provide an RGB-D dataset for estimating the 3D shape of fruits. Specifically, our dataset contains RGB-D frames of single sweet peppers in lab conditions but also in a commercial greenhouse. For each fruit, we additionally collected high-precision point clouds that we use as ground truth. For acquiring the ground truth shape, we developed a measuring process that allows us to record data of real sweet pepper plants, both in the lab and in the greenhouse with high precision, and determine the shape of the sensed fruits. We release our dataset, consisting of almost 7,000 RGB-D frames belonging to more than 100 different fruits. We provide segmented RGB-D frames, with camera intrinsics to easily obtain colored point clouds, together with the corresponding high-precision, occlusion-free point clouds obtained with a high-precision laser scanner. We additionally enable evaluation of shape completion approaches on a hidden test set through a public challenge on a benchmark server.</p></details> |  | None |

We use carefully selected prompt words to guide GPT-2 to generate candidate sentences, from which we select 47K for error annotation. Crowdsourced workers manually check each of these sentences and detect 12k erroneous sentences. We create an error taxonomy to cover 24 types of errors occurring in these erroneous sentences according to the nature of errors with respect to linguistics and knowledge (eg, common sense). For each erroneous span in PLM-generated sentences, we also detect another span that is closely associated with it. Each error is hence manually labeled with comprehensive annotations, including the span of the error, the associated span, minimal correction to the error, the type of the error, and rationale behind the error. Apart from the fully annotated dataset, we also present a detailed description of the data collection procedure, statistics and analysis of the dataset. This is the first dataset with comprehensive annotations for PLM-generated texts, which facilitates the diagnostic evaluation of PLM-based text generation. Furthermore, we use TGEA as a benchmark dataset and propose a series of automatic diagnosis tasks, including error detection, error type classification, associated span detection, error rationale generation, to further promote future study on the automatic error detection and correction on texts generated by pretrained language models.</p></details> | ACL 2021 | None |

Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities. Additionally, we observe that the common approach of improving general VQA capabilities by combining various types of image encoders does not contribute to math reasoning performance. This finding also presents a challenge to enhancing visual reliance during math reasoning.

This dataset and benchmark address the challenges of BEV generation in autonomous driving, particularly by reducing hardware complexity through the use of a single 360-degree camera instead of multiple perspective cameras. Within our benchmark architecture, we propose a novel spherical-image-to-BEV module that leverages spherical imagery and a refined sampling strategy to project features from 2D to 3D. Our approach also includes an innovative application of focal loss, specifically adapted to address the extreme class imbalance often encountered in BEV segmentation tasks, that demonstrates improved segmentation performance on the Dur360BEV dataset.

The long-term goal of Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is to enable machines to autonomously replicate this skill. However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality. We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies. Additionally, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Explanation (PAEval) metric, designed to assess the ability of visual-language foundation models to not only detect anomalies but also provide accurate explanations for their underlying physical causes.

However, robots often need to operate in different domains from those they were trained in, requiring them to adjust to these changes. Tiny mobile robots, subject to size, power, and computational constraints, encounter even more difficulties in running and adapting these algorithms. Such adaptability, though, is crucial for real-world deployment, where robots must operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable settings. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark to evaluate the continual learning capabilities of object detection systems in tiny robotic platforms. Our contributions include: (i) Tiny Robotics Object Detection~(TiROD), a comprehensive dataset collected using the onboard camera of a small mobile robot, designed to test object detectors across various domains and classes; (ii) a benchmark of different continual learning strategies on this dataset using NanoDet, a lightweight object detector.

With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future research development, where the detailed analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly. Data desensitization measures have been conducted for privacy protection.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 | None |

However, they also pose misuse risks. Therefore, detecting AI-generated faces becomes crucial, yet current detectors show biased performance across different demographic groups. Mitigating biases can be done by designing algorithmic fairness methods, which usually require demographically annotated face datasets for model training. However, no existing dataset encompasses both demographic attributes and diverse generative methods simultaneously, which hinders the development of fair detectors for AI-generated faces. In this work, we introduce the AI-Face dataset, the first million-scale demographically annotated AI-generated face image dataset, including real faces, faces from deepfake videos, and faces generated by Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models. Based on this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive fairness benchmark to assess various AI face detectors and provide valuable insights and findings to promote the future fair design of AI face detectors.

Moreover, food is inextricably linked to people's lives, making it a vital research area for practical applications such as dietary management. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, not only in their vast knowledge but also in their ability to handle languages naturally. While English is predominantly used, they can also support multiple languages including Japanese. This suggests that MLLMs are expected to significantly improve performance in food image understanding tasks. We fine-tuned open MLLMs LLaVA-1.5 and Phi-3 Vision on a Japanese recipe dataset and benchmarked their performance against the closed model GPT-4o. We then evaluated the content of generated recipes, including ingredients and cooking procedures, using 5,000 evaluation samples that comprehensively cover Japanese food culture. Our evaluation demonstrates that the open models trained on recipe data outperform GPT-4o, the current state-of-the-art model, in ingredient generation. Our model achieved F1 score of 0.531, surpassing GPT-4o's F1 score of 0.481, indicating a higher level of accuracy. Furthermore, our model exhibited comparable performance to GPT-4o in generating cooking procedure text.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures.

Despite progress in code completion models, benchmarks for Solidity, the primary smart contract language, are lacking. Existing metrics like BLEU do not adequately assess the functional correctness of generated smart contracts. To fill this gap, we introduce SolBench, a benchmark for evaluating the functional correctness of Solidity smart contracts generated by code completion models. SolBench includes 4,178 functions from 1,155 Ethereum-deployed contracts. Testing advanced models revealed challenges in generating correct code without context, as Solidity functions rely on context-defined variables and interfaces. To address this, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Code Repair framework. In this framework, an executor verifies functional correctness, and if necessary, an LLM repairs the code using retrieved snippets informed by executor traces. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs across various model sizes and series to assess their performance in smart contract completion. The results show that code repair and retrieval techniques effectively enhance the correctness of smart contract completion while reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.</p></details> |  | None |

As an external sensor, the camera enhances localization performance by introducing visual constraints. However, obtaining a sufficient number of effective visual features is often challenging, particularly in dynamic or low-texture environments. To address this issue, we incorporate the line features for additional geometric constraints. Unlike traditional approaches that treat point and line features independently, our method exploits the geometric relationships between points and lines in 2D images, enabling fast and robust line matching and triangulation. Additionally, we introduce Motion Consistency Check (MCC) to filter out potential dynamic points, ensuring the effectiveness of point feature updates. The proposed system was evaluated on publicly available datasets and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.

Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.4 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 80 chemical systems, 12 operating temperatures, and 646 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in a series of neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains.

Our benchmark focuses on generating code for visualizing tabular data - such as a Pandas DataFrame - based on natural language instructions, complementing current evaluation tools and expanding their scope. The dataset includes 175 unique tasks. Our experiments assess several leading Large Language Models (LLMs) across three visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We show that the shortening of tasks has a minimal effect on plotting capabilities, allowing for the user interface that accommodates concise user input without sacrificing functionality or accuracy. Another of our findings reveals that while LLMs perform well with popular libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, challenges persist with Plotly, highlighting areas for improvement. We hope that the modular design of our benchmark will broaden the current studies on generating visualizations.

SVGEditBench V2 comprises triplets of an original image, a ground truth image, and the editing prompt. We built the dataset by first extracting image pairs from various SVG emoji datasets. Then, we had GPT-4o to create the prompt. We found that triplets gained by this simple pipeline contain varying sorts of editing tasks. Additionally, we performed the editing tasks with existing LLMs and investigated how those current methods can perform SVG editing.

Although key presses can be directly derived from sheet music, the transitional movements among key presses require more extensive guidance in piano performance. In this work, we construct a piano-hand motion generation benchmark to guide hand movements and fingerings for piano playing. To this end, we collect an annotated dataset, PianoMotion10M, consisting of 116 hours of piano playing videos from a bird's-eye view with 10 million annotated hand poses. We also introduce a powerful baseline model that generates hand motions from piano audios through a position predictor and a position-guided gesture generator. Furthermore, a series of evaluation metrics are designed to assess the performance of the baseline model, including motion similarity, smoothness, positional accuracy of left and right hands, and overall fidelity of movement distribution. Despite that piano key presses with respect to music scores or audios are already accessible, PianoMotion10M aims to provide guidance on piano fingering for instruction purposes.

We address two major problems for tabletop tidying up problem: (1) the lack of public datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the difficulty of specifying the goal configuration of unseen objects. We address the former by presenting the tabletop tidying up (TTU) dataset, a structured dataset collected in simulation. Using this dataset, we train a vision-based discriminator capable of predicting the tidiness score. This discriminator can consistently evaluate the degree of tidiness across unseen configurations, including real-world scenes. Addressing the second problem, we employ Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to find tidying trajectories without specifying explicit goals. Instead of providing specific goals, we demonstrate that our MCTS-based planner can find diverse tidied configurations using the tidiness score as a guidance. Consequently, we propose TSMCTS, which integrates a tidiness discriminator with an MCTS-based tidying planner to find optimal tidied arrangements. TSMCTS has successfully demonstrated its capability across various environments, including coffee tables, dining tables, office desks, and bathrooms.

In the computational analysis of sound scenes, foundation models have emerged as the state of the art to produce high-performance, robust, multi-purpose audio representations. We introduce and release Deep Evaluation of Audio Representations (DEAR), the first dataset and benchmark to evaluate the efficacy of foundation models in capturing essential acoustic properties for hearables. The dataset includes 1,158 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long, created by spatially mixing proprietary monologues with commercial, high-quality recordings of everyday acoustic scenes. Our benchmark encompasses eight tasks that assess the general context, speech sources, and technical acoustic properties of the audio scenes. Through our evaluation of four general-purpose audio representation models, we demonstrate that the BEATs model significantly surpasses its counterparts. This superiority underscores the advantage of models trained on diverse audio collections, confirming their applicability to a wide array of auditory tasks, including encoding the environment properties necessary for hearable steering.

Therefore, the development of a multi-lane dataset and benchmark is necessary. While recent synthetic scene-based NVS datasets have been prepared for cross-lane benchmarking, they still lack the realism of captured images and point clouds. To further assess the performance of existing methods based on NeRF and 3DGS, we present the first multi-lane dataset registering parallel scans specifically for novel driving view synthesis dataset derived from real-world scans, comprising 25 groups of associated sequences, including 16,000 front-view images, 64,000 surround-view images, and 16,000 LiDAR frames. All frames are labeled to differentiate moving objects from static elements. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing approaches in various testing scenarios at different lanes and distances. Additionally, our method provides the solution for solving and assessing the quality of multi-sensor poses for multi-modal data alignment for curating such a dataset in real-world.

However, conventional calibration is laborious and requires dedicated collection. Recent efforts show that learning-based solutions have the potential to be used in place of the repeatability works of manual calibrations. Among these solutions, various learning strategies, networks, geometric priors, and datasets have been investigated. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of learning-based camera calibration techniques, by analyzing their strengths and limitations. Our main calibration categories include the standard pinhole camera model, distortion camera model, cross-view model, and cross-sensor model, following the research trend and extended applications. As there is no unified benchmark in this community, we collect a holistic calibration dataset that can serve as a public platform to evaluate the generalization of existing methods. It comprises both synthetic and real-world data, with images and videos captured by different cameras in diverse scenes. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide further research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first survey for the learning-based camera calibration (spanned 10 years).

In this paper, we release a novel dataset, VTechAGP, which is the first academic-to-general-audience text paraphrase dataset consisting of document-level these and dissertation academic and general-audience abstract pairs from 8 colleges authored over 25 years. We also propose a novel dynamic soft prompt generative language model, DSPT5. For training, we leverage a contrastive-generative loss function to learn the keyword vectors in the dynamic prompt. For inference, we adopt a crowd-sampling decoding strategy at both semantic and structural levels to further select the best output candidate. We evaluate DSPT5 and various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) from multiple perspectives. Results demonstrate that the SOTA LLMs do not provide satisfactory outcomes, while the lightweight DSPT5 can achieve competitive results.

By enhancing these capabilities, humans can more effectively utilize data, leading to better comprehension and learning outcomes. Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on question answering, often neglecting the full potential of questioning and assessment skills. Inspired by the human learning mechanism, we introduce LOVA3, an innovative framework named "Learning tO Visual question Answering, Asking and Assessment," designed to equip MLLMs with these additional capabilities. Our approach involves the creation of two supplementary training tasks GenQA and EvalQA, aiming at fostering the skills of asking and assessing questions in the context of images. To develop the questioning ability, we compile a comprehensive set of multimodal foundational tasks. For assessment, we introduce a new benchmark called EvalQABench, comprising 64,000 training samples (split evenly between positive and negative samples) and 5,000 validation and testing samples. We posit that enhancing MLLMs with the capabilities to answer, ask, and assess questions will enhance their multimodal comprehension, ultimately improving overall performance. To validate this hypothesis, we train MLLMs using the LOVA3 framework and evaluate them on a range of multimodal datasets and benchmarks.

Mobile GUI agents, a subset of AI agents, are designed to autonomously perform tasks on mobile devices.

However, existing MLLMs still face challenges in achieving precise grounding in complex multi-image scenarios. To address this, we first explore a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that integrates single-image grounding with multi-image comprehension. While partially effective, it remains unstable and struggles to capture abstract visual information due to its non-end-to-end nature. Therefore, we introduce Migician, the first multi-image grounding model capable of performing free-form and accurate grounding across multiple images. To support this, we present the MGrounding-630k dataset, which comprises data for several multi-image grounding tasks derived from existing datasets, along with newly generated free-form grounding instruction-following data. Furthermore, we propose MIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multi-image grounding capabilities.

This dataset is handcrafted in non-English languages first, each of these source languages being represented among the 23 languages commonly used by half of the world's population and therefore having the potential to serve as pivot languages that will enable more accurate translations. The dataset is specially designed to avoid contamination and be multicentric, so as to enforce representation of multilingual language features. In addition, the dataset goes beyond the sentence level, as it is organized in paragraphs of various lengths. Compared with related machine translation (MT) datasets, we show that BOUQuET has a broader representation of domains while simplifying the translation task for non-experts. Therefore, BOUQuET is specially suitable for the open initiative and call for translation participation that we are launching to extend it to a multi-way parallel corpus to any written language.</p></details> |  | None |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements. The source code for our methodology and the three created datasets can be found on https://github.com/github-usr-ano/Temporal_Graph_Data_PDEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/github-usr-ano/Temporal_Graph_Data_PDEs) |

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have the potential to assist in understanding anatomical information, diagnosing eye diseases, and drafting interpretations and follow-up plans, thereby reducing the burden on clinicians and improving access to eye care. However, limited benchmarks are available to assess LVLMs' performance in ophthalmology-specific applications. In this study, we introduce LMOD, a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark consisting of 21,993 instances across (1) five ophthalmic imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography, color fundus photographs, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, lens photographs, and surgical scenes; (2) free-text, demographic, and disease biomarker information; and (3) primary ophthalmology-specific applications such as anatomical information understanding, disease diagnosis, and subgroup analysis. In addition, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art LVLM representatives from closed-source, open-source, and medical domains. The results demonstrate a significant performance drop for LVLMs in ophthalmology compared to other domains. Systematic error analysis further identified six major failure modes: misclassification, failure to abstain, inconsistent reasoning, hallucination, assertions without justification, and lack of domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, supervised neural networks specifically trained on these tasks as baselines demonstrated high accuracy. These findings underscore the pressing need for benchmarks in the development and validation of ophthalmology-specific LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 NAACL: Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics Project Page: https://kfzyqin.github.io/lmod/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kfzyqin.github.io/lmod) |

The dataset comprises 1,000 videos, featuring 85,000 multiple-choice QA pairs, 2,300 object captioning, and 5,700 object grounding annotations, encompassing diverse real-world conditions such as adverse weather and traffic anomalies. By incorporating tuple-based spatio-temporal object expressions, TUMTraffic-VideoQA unifies three essential tasks-multiple-choice video question answering, referred object captioning, and spatio-temporal object grounding-within a cohesive evaluation framework. We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems.

| **[No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02379v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches on popular benchmark datasets. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- the graph structure and the node features -- , we introduce RINGS, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., by quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing, from a distinct angle, the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for graph-learning dataset evaluation in an extensive set of experiments and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a first step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

No existing dataset provides the necessary mixture of complex, dynamic, and multi-view data. To facilitate the development of 3D and 4D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving context, we propose a Synthetic Ego--Exo Dynamic 4D (SEED4D) data generator and dataset. We present a customizable, easy-to-use data generator for spatio-temporal multi-view data creation. Our open-source data generator allows the creation of synthetic data for camera setups commonly used in the NuScenes, KITTI360, and Waymo datasets. Additionally, SEED4D encompasses two large-scale multi-view synthetic urban scene datasets. Our static (3D) dataset encompasses 212k inward- and outward-facing vehicle images from 2k scenes, while our dynamic (4D) dataset contains 16.8M images from 10k trajectories, each sampled at 100 points in time with egocentric images, exocentric images, and LiDAR data.

Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) struggle with counting tasks, especially when the number of objects exceeds those commonly encountered during training. We enhance LVLMs' counting abilities using a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking counting problems into sub-counting tasks. Our method employs a mechanism that prevents bisecting and thus repetitive counting of objects, which occurs in a naive divide-and-conquer approach. Unlike prior methods, which do not generalize well to counting datasets they have not been trained on, our method performs well on new datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that our approach enhances the counting capability of LVLMs across various datasets and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 24 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> | None |

However, toxic feedback can discourage authors and hinder scientific progress. This work explores an important but underexplored area: detecting toxicity in peer reviews. We first define toxicity in peer reviews across four distinct categories and curate a dataset of peer reviews from the OpenReview platform, annotated by human experts according to these definitions. Leveraging this dataset, we benchmark a variety of models, including a dedicated toxicity detection model, a sentiment analysis model, several open-source large language models (LLMs), and two closed-source LLMs. Our experiments explore the impact of different prompt granularities, from coarse to fine-grained instructions, on model performance. Notably, state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 exhibit low alignment with human judgments under simple prompts but achieve improved alignment with detailed instructions. Moreover, the model's confidence score is a good indicator of better alignment with human judgments. For example, GPT-4 achieves a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.56 with human judgments, which increases to 0.63 when using only predictions with a confidence score higher than 95%. Overall, our dataset and benchmarks underscore the need for continued research to enhance toxicity detection capabilities of LLMs. By addressing this issue, our work aims to contribute to a healthy and responsible environment for constructive academic discourse and scientific collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WiML workshop @Neurips 2024</p></details> | None |

To perform software testing, testers need to write code snippets that execute the program under test. Recently, researchers have recognized the potential of large language models (LLMs) in software testing. However, there remains a lack of fair comparisons between different LLMs in terms of test case generation capabilities. In this paper, we propose TESTEVAL, a novel benchmark for test case generation with LLMs. We collect 210 Python programs from an online programming platform, LeetCode, and design three different tasks: overall coverage, targeted line/branch coverage, and targeted path coverage. We further evaluate sixteen popular LLMs, including both commercial and open-source ones, on TESTEVAL. We find that generating test cases to cover specific program lines/branches/paths is still challenging for current LLMs, indicating a lack of ability to comprehend program logic and execution paths.

However, the prior methods primarily focus on enhancing RGB images in a post-processing manner, neglecting the challenges of image signal processor (ISP) dealing with event sensor and the benefits events provide for reforming the ISP process. To achieve this, we conduct the first research on event-guided ISP. First, we present a new event-RAW paired dataset, collected with a novel but still confidential sensor that records pixel-level aligned events and RAW images. This dataset includes 3373 RAW images with 2248 x 3264 resolution and their corresponding events, spanning 24 scenes with 3 exposure modes and 3 lenses. Second, we propose a conventional ISP pipeline to generate good RGB frames as reference. This conventional ISP pipleline performs basic ISP operations, e.g.demosaicing, white balancing, denoising and color space transforming, with a ColorChecker as reference. Third, we classify the existing learnable ISP methods into 3 classes, and select multiple methods to train and evaluate on our new dataset. Lastly, since there is no prior work for reference, we propose a simple event-guided ISP method and test it on our dataset. We further put forward key technical challenges and future directions in RGB-Event ISP. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the very first research focusing on event-guided ISP, and we hope it will inspire the community.

This cognitive theory provides a foundation for researching how robots can more effectively imitate human behavior. However, current research either employs multiple cameras with different views focusing on the same individual's behavior simultaneously or encounters unpair ego-exo view scenarios, there is no effort to fully exploit human cognitive behavior in the real world. To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce a novel large-scale egocentric dataset, called EgoMe, which towards following the process of human imitation learning via egocentric view in the real world. Our dataset includes 7902 pairs of videos (15804 videos) for diverse daily behaviors in real-world scenarios. For a pair of videos, one video captures a exocentric view of the imitator observing the demonstrator's actions, while the other captures a egocentric view of the imitator subsequently following those actions. Notably, our dataset also contain exo-ego eye gaze, angular velocity, acceleration, magnetic strength and other sensor multi-modal data for assisting in establishing correlations between observing and following process. In addition, we also propose eight challenging benchmark tasks for fully leveraging this data resource and promoting the research of robot imitation learning ability. Extensive statistical analysis demonstrates significant advantages compared to existing datasets. The proposed EgoMe dataset and benchmark will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[General Scene Adaptation for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17403v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks mainly evaluate agents based on one-time execution of individual instructions across multiple environments, aiming to develop agents capable of functioning in any environment in a zero-shot manner. However, real-world navigation robots often operate in persistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual observations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task setting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating continuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these real-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to execute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously adapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task, one has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD data, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each scene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly expands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R dataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts. Furthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that leverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing techniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is motivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent signatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various methods. Based on our findings, we propose a novel method, GR-DUET, which incorporates memory-based navigation graphs with an environment-specific training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on all GSA-R2R splits.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

Unlike traditional supervised learning approaches learning from predefined labels, ALMs utilize natural language as a supervision signal, which is more suitable for describing complex real-world audio recordings. ALMs demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities and can be flexibly adapted to diverse downstream tasks. These strengths not only enhance the accuracy and generalization of audio processing tasks but also promote the development of models that more closely resemble human auditory perception and comprehension. Recent advances in ALMs have positioned them at the forefront of computer audition research, inspiring a surge of efforts to advance ALM technologies. Despite rapid progress in the field of ALMs, there is still a notable lack of systematic surveys that comprehensively organize and analyze developments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of ALMs with a focus on general audio tasks, aiming to fill this gap by providing a structured and holistic overview of ALMs. Specifically, we cover: (1) the background of computer audition and audio-language models; (2) the foundational aspects of ALMs, including prevalent network architectures, training objectives, and evaluation methods; (3) foundational pre-training and audio-language pre-training approaches; (4) task-specific fine-tuning, multi-task tuning and agent systems for downstream applications; (5) datasets and benchmarks; and (6) current challenges and future directions.

An emerging application is using LLMs to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These systems require LLMs to understand user queries, retrieve relevant information, and synthesize coherent and accurate responses. Given the increasing real-world deployment of such systems, comprehensive evaluation becomes crucial. To this end, we propose FRAMES (Factuality, Retrieval, And reasoning MEasurement Set), a high-quality evaluation dataset designed to test LLMs' ability to provide factual responses, assess retrieval capabilities, and evaluate the reasoning required to generate final answers. While previous work has provided datasets and benchmarks to evaluate these abilities in isolation, FRAMES offers a unified framework that provides a clearer picture of LLM performance in end-to-end RAG scenarios. Our dataset comprises challenging multi-hop questions that require the integration of information from multiple sources. We present baseline results demonstrating that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, achieving 0.40 accuracy with no retrieval. The accuracy is significantly improved with our proposed multi-step retrieval pipeline, achieving an accuracy of 0.66 (>50% improvement). We hope our work will help bridge evaluation gaps and assist in developing more robust and capable RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), 2025</p></details> | None |

While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues. In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally. The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet. A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage. Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%. These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).</p></details> |  | None |

However, an incomplete object-level point cloud can have multiple valid completion solutions when it is examined in isolation. This one-to-many mapping issue can cause contradictory supervision signals to the network because the loss function may produce different values for identical input-output pairs of the network. In many cases, this issue could adversely affect the network optimization process. In this work, we propose to enhance the conventional learning objective using a novel completion consistency loss to mitigate the one-to-many mapping problem. Specifically, the proposed consistency loss ensure that a point cloud completion network generates a coherent completion solution for incomplete objects originating from the same source point cloud. Experimental results across multiple well-established datasets and benchmarks demonstrated the proposed completion consistency loss have excellent capability to enhance the completion performance of various existing networks without any modification to the design of the networks. The proposed consistency loss enhances the performance of the point completion network without affecting the inference speed, thereby increasing the accuracy of point cloud completion. Notably, a state-of-the-art point completion network trained with the proposed consistency loss can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging new MVP dataset.

Recently, the emergence of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has shown promise in general video understanding tasks. However, describing facial expressions within videos poses two major challenges for these models: (1) the lack of adequate datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the limited visual token capacity of video MLLMs. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new instruction-following dataset tailored for dynamic facial expression caption. The dataset comprises 5,033 high-quality video clips annotated manually, containing over 700,000 tokens. Its purpose is to improve the capability of video MLLMs to discern subtle facial nuances. Furthermore, we propose FaceTrack-MM, which leverages a limited number of tokens to encode the main character's face. This model demonstrates superior performance in tracking faces and focusing on the facial expressions of the main characters, even in intricate multi-person scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric combining event extraction, relation classification, and the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to assess the content consistency and temporal sequence consistency of generated text. Moreover, we present FEC-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of existing video MLLMs in this specific task.

Traditional security measures often fall short, highlighting the need for intelligent solutions capable of detecting shoplifting behaviors in real time. This paper frames shoplifting detection as an anomaly detection problem, focusing on the identification of deviations from typical shopping patterns. We introduce PoseLift, a privacy-preserving dataset specifically designed for shoplifting detection, addressing challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and model biases. PoseLift is built in collaboration with a retail store and contains anonymized human pose data from real-world scenarios. By preserving essential behavioral information while anonymizing identities, PoseLift balances privacy and utility. We benchmark state-of-the-art pose-based anomaly detection models on this dataset, evaluating performance using a comprehensive set of metrics. Our results demonstrate that pose-based approaches achieve high detection accuracy while effectively addressing privacy and bias concerns inherent in traditional methods. As one of the first datasets capturing real-world shoplifting behaviors, PoseLift offers researchers a valuable tool to advance computer vision ethically and will be publicly available to foster innovation and collaboration.

The field of machine learning is increasingly observing the importance of data curation to the advancement of both applications and fundamental understanding of machine learning models - evidenced not least by the creation of the Datasets and Benchmarks track itself. This work provides an analysis of dataset development practices at NeurIPS through the lens of data curation. We present an evaluation framework for dataset documentation, consisting of a rubric and toolkit developed through a literature review of data curation principles. We use the framework to assess the strengths and weaknesses in current dataset development practices of 60 datasets published in the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track from 2021-2023.

To address these issues, we introduce (1) a GPT-assisted data construction process resulting in an instruction-following dataset called DFA-Instruct, (2) a benchmark named DFA-Bench, designed to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in deepfake detection, deepfake classification, and artifact description, and (3) construct an interactive deepfake analysis system called DFA-GPT, as a strong baseline for the community, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module. The dataset and code will be made available at https://github.com/lxq1000/DFA-Instruct to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/lxq1000/DFA-Instruct) |
| **[A Survey on Large Language Model Acceleration based on KV Cache Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19442v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

As these models increasingly integrate into our daily life, it is necessary to conduct moral evaluation to ensure that their outputs align with human values and remain within moral boundaries. Previous works primarily focus on LLMs, proposing moral datasets and benchmarks limited to text modality. However, given the rapid development of LVLMs, there is still a lack of multimodal moral evaluation methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce M$^3$oralBench, the first MultiModal Moral Benchmark for LVLMs. M$^3$oralBench expands the everyday moral scenarios in Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs) and employs the text-to-image diffusion model, SD3.0, to create corresponding scenario images. It conducts moral evaluation across six moral foundations of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and encompasses tasks in moral judgement, moral classification, and moral response, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in multimodal moral understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 popular open-source and closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that M$^3$oralBench is a challenging benchmark, exposing notable moral limitations in current models. Our benchmark is publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

However, exploring and exploiting the extensive knowledge of these models to comprehend multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To fill this research gap, we first introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale multi-omics biological sequences-related instruction-tuning dataset including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules, designed to bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and complex biological sequences-related tasks. This dataset can enhance the versatility of LLMs by integrating diverse biological sequenced-based prediction tasks with advanced reasoning capabilities, while maintaining conversational fluency. Additionally, we reveal significant performance limitations in even state-of-the-art LLMs on biological sequence-related multi-omics tasks without specialized pre-training and instruction-tuning. We further develop a strong baseline called ChatMultiOmics with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating the powerful ability to understand biology by using Biology-Instructions. Biology-Instructions and ChatMultiOmics are publicly available and crucial resources for enabling more effective integration of LLMs with multi-omics sequence analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methodologies and benchmarks are constrained by the use of small-scale, manually collected demonstrations, lacking the general dataset and benchmark support necessary to explore scene geometry generalization effectively. To address this gap, we introduce Mimicking-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for generalizable humanoid-scene interaction learning through mimicking large-scale human animation references. Mimicking-Bench includes six household full-body humanoid-scene interaction tasks, covering 11K diverse object shapes, along with 20K synthetic and 3K real-world human interaction skill references. We construct a complete humanoid skill learning pipeline and benchmark approaches for motion retargeting, motion tracking, imitation learning, and their various combinations. Extensive experiments highlight the value of human mimicking for skill learning, revealing key challenges and research directions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WildPPG: A Real-World PPG Dataset of Long Continuous Recordings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17540v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) has become the default sensing technique in wearable devices to monitor cardiac activity via a person's heart rate (HR). However, PPG-based HR estimates can be substantially impacted by factors such as the wearer's activities, sensor placement and resulting motion artifacts, as well as environmental characteristics such as temperature and ambient light. These and other factors can significantly impact and decrease HR prediction reliability. In this paper, we show that state-of-the-art HR estimation methods struggle when processing \emph{representative} data from everyday activities in outdoor environments, likely because they rely on existing datasets that captured controlled conditions. We introduce a novel multimodal dataset and benchmark results for continuous PPG recordings during outdoor activities from 16 participants over 13.5 hours, captured from four wearable sensors, each worn at a different location on the body, totaling 216\,hours. Our recordings include accelerometer, temperature, and altitude data, as well as a synchronized Lead I-based electrocardiogram for ground-truth HR references. Participants completed a round trip from Zurich to Jungfraujoch, a tall mountain in Switzerland over the course of one day. The trip included outdoor and indoor activities such as walking, hiking, stair climbing, eating, drinking, and resting at various temperatures and altitudes (up to 3,571\,m above sea level) as well as using cars, trains, cable cars, and lifts for transport -- all of which impacted participants' physiological dynamics. We also present a novel method that estimates HR values more robustly in such real-world scenarios than existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Automatic Spectral Calibration of Hyperspectral Images:Method, Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14925v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) densely samples the world in both the space and frequency domain and therefore is more distinctive than RGB images. Usually, HSI needs to be calibrated to minimize the impact of various illumination conditions. The traditional way to calibrate HSI utilizes a physical reference, which involves manual operations, occlusions, and/or limits camera mobility. These limitations inspire this paper to automatically calibrate HSIs using a learning-based method. Towards this goal, a large-scale HSI calibration dataset is created, which has 765 high-quality HSI pairs covering diversified natural scenes and illuminations. The dataset is further expanded to 7650 pairs by combining with 10 different physically measured illuminations. A spectral illumination transformer (SIT) together with an illumination attention module is proposed. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate the SoTA performance of the proposed SIT. The benchmarks also indicate that low-light conditions are more challenging than normal conditions. The dataset and codes are available online:https://github.com/duranze/Automatic-spectral-calibration-of-HSI</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/duranze/Automatic-spectral-calibration-of-HSI) |

This scale of radiological studies provides a significant opportunity to streamline CXR interpretation and documentation. While foundation models are a promising solution, the lack of publicly available large-scale datasets and benchmarks inhibits their iterative development and real-world evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we constructed a large-scale dataset (CheXinstruct), which we utilized to train a vision-language foundation model (CheXagent). We systematically demonstrated competitive performance across eight distinct task types on our novel evaluation benchmark (CheXbench). Beyond technical validation, we assessed the real-world utility of CheXagent in directly drafting radiology reports. Our clinical assessment with eight radiologists revealed a 36% time saving for residents using CheXagent-drafted reports, while attending radiologists showed no significant time difference editing resident-drafted or CheXagent-drafted reports. The CheXagent-drafted reports improved the writing efficiency of both radiology residents and attending radiologists in 81% and 61% of cases, respectively, without loss of quality. Overall, we demonstrate that CheXagent can effectively perform a variety of CXR interpretation tasks and holds potential to assist radiologists in routine clinical workflows.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures | None |

Gene studies require clean, factual datasets to ensure reliable results. Ontology graphs, neatly organized domain terminology graphs, provide ideal sources for domain facts. However, available gene ontology annotations are currently distributed across various databases without unified identifiers for genes and gene products. To address these challenges, we introduce Unified Entrez Gene Identifier Dataset and Benchmarks (UniEntrezDB), the first systematic effort to unify large-scale public Gene Ontology Annotations (GOA) from various databases using unique gene identifiers. UniEntrezDB includes a pre-training dataset and four downstream tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate gene embedding performance from gene, protein, and cell levels, ultimately enhancing the reliability and applicability of LLMs in gene research and other professional settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there exists a knowledge gap in how to apply geometric reconstruction and photorealism modeling (novel view synthesis) in a unified framework. To address this gap and promote the development of robust and immersive modeling and rendering with consumer-grade devices, we propose a real-world Multi-Sensor Hybrid Room Dataset (MuSHRoom). Our dataset presents exciting challenges and requires state-of-the-art methods to be cost-effective, robust to noisy data and devices, and can jointly learn 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis instead of treating them as separate tasks, making them ideal for real-world applications. We benchmark several famous pipelines on our dataset for joint 3D mesh reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our dataset and benchmark show great potential in promoting the improvements for fusing 3D reconstruction and high-quality rendering in a robust and computationally efficient end-to-end fashion.

Despite notable advancements in the fields of video summarization and highlight detection, which can create partially usable short films from raw videos, these approaches are often domain-specific and require an in-depth understanding of real-world video content. To tackle this predicament, we propose Repurpose-10K, an extensive dataset comprising over 10,000 videos with more than 120,000 annotated clips aimed at resolving the video long-to-short task. Recognizing the inherent constraints posed by untrained human annotators, which can result in inaccurate annotations for repurposed videos, we propose a two-stage solution to obtain annotations from real-world user-generated content. Furthermore, we offer a baseline model to address this challenging task by integrating audio, visual, and caption aspects through a cross-modal fusion and alignment framework. We aspire for our work to ignite groundbreaking research in the lesser-explored realms of video repurposing.</p></details> | AAAI2025 | None |

However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks. Finally, we propose an extendable framework for training NNPs and implement 10 models within it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS2024 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks (Poster)</p></details> | None |
| **[LCFO: Long Context and Long Form Output Dataset and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08268v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains. LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively). It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%). Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6). The LCFO benchmark offers a standardized platform for evaluating summarization and summary expansion performance, as well as corresponding automatic metrics, thereby providing an important evaluation framework to advance generative AI.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we present a mobile robot oriented large-scale indoor dataset, denoted as THUD++ (TsingHua University Dynamic) robotic dataset, for dynamic scene understanding. Our current dataset includes 13 large-scale dynamic scenarios, combining both real-world and synthetic data collected with a real robot platform and a physical simulation platform, respectively. The RGB-D dataset comprises over 90K image frames, 20M 2D/3D bounding boxes of static and dynamic objects, camera poses, and IMU. The trajectory dataset covers over 6,000 pedestrian trajectories in indoor scenes. Additionally, the dataset is augmented with a Unity3D-based simulation platform, allowing researchers to create custom scenes and test algorithms in a controlled environment. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods on THUD++ across mainstream indoor scene understanding tasks, e.g., 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, relocalization, pedestrian trajectory prediction, and navigation. Our experiments highlight the challenges mobile robots encounter in indoor environments, especially when navigating in complex, crowded, and dynamic scenes.

While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their potential to simulate human behavior, enabling the replication of individual responses and facilitating studies on many interdisciplinary studies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the recent progress in simulation driven by LLM-empowered agents. We categorize the simulations into three types: (1) Individual Simulation, which mimics specific individuals or demographic groups; (2) Scenario Simulation, where multiple agents collaborate to achieve goals within specific contexts; and (3) Society Simulation, which models interactions within agent societies to reflect the complexity and variety of real-world dynamics. These simulations follow a progression, ranging from detailed individual modeling to large-scale societal phenomena. We provide a detailed discussion of each simulation type, including the architecture or key components of the simulation, the classification of objectives or scenarios and the evaluation method. Afterward, we summarize commonly used datasets and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the trends across these three types of simulation.

Existing language datasets for driving primarily capture interactions caused by close distances. However, interactions induced by traffic rules and human intentions, which can occur over long distances, are yet sufficiently covered. To address this, WOMD-Reasoning presents by far the largest multi-modal Q&A dataset on real-world driving scenarios, covering a wide range of driving topics from map descriptions and motion status descriptions to narratives and analyses of agents' interactions, behaviors, and intentions.

However, existing TAG datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data.

However, this ISA shift poses significant challenges, mainly due to the extensive legacy ecosystem of x86 software and lack of portability across proprietary ecosystems and software stacks. This paper introduces CRT, a lightweight LLM-based transpiler that automatically converts x86 assembly to ARM assembly. Our approach bridges the fundamental architectural gap between x86's CISC-based and ARM's RISC-based computing paradigms while preserving program semantics and optimizing performance. We evaluate CRT on diverse real-world applications, achieving 79.25% translation accuracy from x86 to ARMv5 on our comprehensive test suite, and an 88.68% accuracy from x86 to RISC-V. In practical deployments on Apple M2 hardware (ARMv8), our transpiled code achieves 1.73$\times$ speedup compared to Apple's Rosetta 2 virtualization engine, while delivering 2.41$\times$ memory efficiency and 1.47$\times$ better energy consumption. Through testing and analysis, we show that CRT successfully navigates the CISC/RISC divide and generates correctly executable RISC code despite machine ``language'' barriers.

However, the inherent challenges of vascular imaging, such as sparsity, fine granularity, low contrast, data distribution variability, and the critical need for preserving topological structure, making generalized vessel segmentation particularly complex. While specialized segmentation methods have been developed for specific anatomical regions, their over-reliance on tailored models hinders broader applicability and generalization. General-purpose segmentation models introduced in medical imaging often fail to address critical vascular characteristics, including the connectivity of segmentation results. To overcome these limitations, we propose an optimized vessel segmentation framework: a structure-agnostic approach incorporating small vessel enhancement and morphological correction for multi-modality vessel segmentation. To train and validate this framework, we compiled a comprehensive multi-modality dataset spanning 17 datasets and benchmarked our model against six SAM-based methods and 17 expert models. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy, generalization, and a 34.6% improvement in connectivity, underscoring its clinical potential. An ablation study further validates the effectiveness of the proposed improvements. We will release the code and dataset at github following the publication of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figurres, submitted to TIP</p></details> | None |

However, they face a significant challenge: hallucinations, where models produce plausible-sounding but factually incorrect responses. This undermines trust and limits the applicability of LLMs in different domains. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), on the other hand, provide a structured collection of interconnected facts represented as entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). In recent research, KGs have been leveraged to provide context that can fill gaps in an LLM understanding of certain topics offering a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, enhancing their reliability and accuracy while benefiting from their wide applicability. Nonetheless, it is still a very active area of research with various unresolved open problems. In this paper, we discuss these open challenges covering state-of-the-art datasets and benchmarks as well as methods for knowledge integration and evaluating hallucinations. In our discussion, we consider the current use of KGs in LLM systems and identify future directions within each of these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> | None |

Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Unlocking the `Why' of Buying: Introducing a New Dataset and Benchmark for Purchase Reason and Post-Purchase Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13417v3)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In business and marketing, analyzing the reasons behind buying is a fundamental step towards understanding consumer behaviors, shaping business strategies, and predicting market outcomes. Prior research on purchase reason has relied on surveys to gather data from users. However, this method is limited in scalability, often focusing on specific products or brands, and may not accurately represent the broader population due to the restricted number of participants involved. In our work, we propose purchase reason prediction as a novel task for modern AI models. To benchmark potential AI solutions for this new task, we first generate a dataset that consists of real-world explanations of why users make certain purchase decisions for various products. Our approach induces LLMs to explicitly distinguish between the reasons behind purchasing a product and the experience after the purchase in a user review. An automated, LLM-driven evaluation as well as a small scale human evaluation confirm the effectiveness of this approach to obtaining high-quality, personalized purchase reasons and post-purchase experiences. With this novel dataset, we are able to benchmark the purchase reason prediction task using various LLMs. Moreover, we demonstrate how purchase reasons can be valuable for downstream applications, such as marketing-focused user behavior analysis, post-purchase experience and rating prediction in recommender systems, and serving as a new approach to justify recommendations.</p></details> |  | None |

The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems.

Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical Machine Learning and other Deep Learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages.

Accurate analysis of 3D dental scans is essential for orthodontic and prosthetic treatment planning, as it enables automated processing and reduces the need for manual adjustments by dental professionals. However, developing robust automated tools for these tasks remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of high-quality public datasets and benchmarks. This article introduces Teeth3DS+, the first comprehensive public benchmark designed to advance the field of intraoral 3D scan analysis. Developed as part of the 3DTeethSeg 2022 and 3DTeethLand 2024 MICCAI challenges, Teeth3DS+ aims to drive research in teeth identification, segmentation, labeling, 3D modeling, and dental landmarks identification. The dataset includes at least 1,800 intraoral scans (containing 23,999 annotated teeth) collected from 900 patients, covering both upper and lower jaws separately. All data have been acquired and validated by experienced orthodontists and dental surgeons with over five years of expertise.

Yet, few text embeddings specialized for finance have been reported in the literature, perhaps in part due to a lack of public datasets and benchmarks. We present BAM embeddings, a set of text embeddings finetuned on a carefully constructed dataset of 14.3M query-passage pairs. Demonstrating the benefits of domain-specific training, BAM embeddings achieve Recall@1 of 62.8% on a held-out test set, vs. only 39.2% for the best general-purpose text embedding from OpenAI. Further, BAM embeddings increase question answering accuracy by 8% on FinanceBench and show increased sensitivity to the finance-specific elements that are found in detailed, forward-looking and company and date-specific queries. To support further research we describe our approach in detail, quantify the importance of hard negative mining and dataset scale.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 | None |

To help address this, we introduce ASL STEM Wiki: a parallel corpus of 254 Wikipedia articles on STEM topics in English, interpreted into over 300 hours of American Sign Language (ASL). ASL STEM Wiki is the first continuous signing dataset focused on STEM, facilitating the development of AI resources for STEM education in ASL. We identify several use cases of ASL STEM Wiki with human-centered applications. For example, because this dataset highlights the frequent use of fingerspelling for technical concepts, which inhibits DHH students' ability to learn, we develop models to identify fingerspelled words -- which can later be used to query for appropriate ASL signs to suggest to interpreters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024</p></details> | None |

Our dataset has unique properties that are uncommon to current benchmarks for 2D and 3D puzzle solving. The fragments and fractures are realistic, caused by a collapse of a fresco during a World War II bombing at the Pompeii archaeological park. The fragments are also eroded and have missing pieces with irregular shapes and different dimensions, challenging further the reassembly algorithms. The dataset is multi-modal providing high resolution images with characteristic pictorial elements, detailed 3D scans of the fragments and meta-data annotated by the archaeologists. Ground truth has been generated through several years of unceasing fieldwork, including the excavation and cleaning of each fragment, followed by manual puzzle solving by archaeologists of a subset of approx. 1000 pieces among the 16000 available. After digitizing all the fragments in 3D, a benchmark was prepared to challenge current reassembly and puzzle-solving methods that often solve more simplistic synthetic scenarios. The tested baselines show that there clearly exists a gap to fill in solving this computationally complex problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024, Track Datasets and Benchmarks, 10 pages</p></details> | None |

Although ethics reviews, documentation, and checklists have been established, it remains uncertain whether consistent dataset management practices exist across the community. This lack of a comprehensive overview hinders our ability to diagnose and address fundamental tensions and ethical issues related to managing large datasets. We present a systematic review of datasets published at the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track, focusing on four key aspects: provenance, distribution, ethical disclosure, and licensing. Our findings reveal that dataset provenance is often unclear due to ambiguous filtering and curation processes. Additionally, a variety of sites are used for dataset hosting, but only a few offer structured metadata and version control. These inconsistencies underscore the urgent need for standardized data infrastructures for the publication and management of datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 tables | None |

A major challenge in current cloud removal research is the absence of a comprehensive benchmark and a sufficiently large and diverse training dataset. To address this problem, we introduce the largest public dataset -- $\textit{AllClear}$ for cloud removal, featuring 23,742 globally distributed regions of interest (ROIs) with diverse land-use patterns, comprising 4 million images in total.

However, The NAS methods require high computational costs due to the high dimension search space and the need to train multiple candidate solutions. This paper introduces LCoDeepNEAT, an instantiation of Lamarckian genetic algorithms, which extends the foundational principles of the CoDeepNEAT framework. LCoDeepNEAT co-evolves CNN architectures and their respective final layer weights. The evaluation process of LCoDeepNEAT entails a single epoch of SGD, followed by the transference of the acquired final layer weights to the genetic representation of the network. In addition, it expedites the process of evolving by imposing restrictions on the architecture search space, specifically targeting architectures comprising just two fully connected layers for classification. Our method yields a notable improvement in the classification accuracy of candidate solutions throughout the evolutionary process, ranging from 2% to 5.6%. This outcome underscores the efficacy and effectiveness of integrating gradient information and evolving the last layer of candidate solutions within LCoDeepNEAT. LCoDeepNEAT is assessed across six standard image classification datasets and benchmarked against eight leading NAS methods. Results demonstrate LCoDeepNEAT's ability to swiftly discover competitive CNN architectures with fewer parameters, conserving computational resources, and achieving superior classification accuracy compared to other approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to prohibitively high cost in time and money, there is still lack of open-source and large-scale benchmarks in this field. It is mainly the case for airfoil inverse design, which requires to generate and edit diverse geometric-qualified and aerodynamic-qualified airfoils following the multimodal instructions, \emph{i.e.,} dragging points and physical parameters. This paper presents the open-source endeavors in airfoil inverse design, \emph{AFBench}, including a large-scale dataset with 200 thousand airfoils and high-quality aerodynamic and geometric labels, two novel and practical airfoil inverse design tasks, \emph{i.e.,} conditional generation on multimodal physical parameters, controllable editing, and comprehensive metrics to evaluate various existing airfoil inverse design methods.

Off-road environments are rich in geometric information, therefore it is suitable for 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks to reconstruct such scenes. However, most of researches concentrate on on-road environments, and few methods are designed for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction due to the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In response to this gap, we introduce WildOcc, to our knowledge, the first benchmark to provide dense occupancy annotations for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks. A ground truth generation pipeline is proposed in this paper, which employs a coarse-to-fine reconstruction to achieve a more realistic result. Moreover, we introduce a multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework, which fuses spatio-temporal information from multi-frame images and point clouds at voxel level. In addition, a cross-modality distillation function is introduced, which transfers geometric knowledge from point clouds to image features.</p></details> |  | None |

However, generating diverse remote sensing (RS) images that are tremendously different from general images in terms of scale and perspective remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of a comprehensive remote sensing image generation dataset with various modalities, ground sample distances (GSD), and scenes. In this paper, we propose a Multi-modal, Multi-GSD, Multi-scene Remote Sensing (MMM-RS) dataset and benchmark for text-to-image generation in diverse remote sensing scenarios. Specifically, we first collect nine publicly available RS datasets and conduct standardization for all samples. To bridge RS images to textual semantic information, we utilize a large-scale pretrained vision-language model to automatically output text prompts and perform hand-crafted rectification, resulting in information-rich text-image pairs (including multi-modal images). In particular, we design some methods to obtain the images with different GSD and various environments (e.g., low-light, foggy) in a single sample. With extensive manual screening and refining annotations, we ultimately obtain a MMM-RS dataset that comprises approximately 2.1 million text-image pairs. Extensive experimental results verify that our proposed MMM-RS dataset allows off-the-shelf diffusion models to generate diverse RS images across various modalities, scenes, weather conditions, and GSD.

Considering the diversity of sign languages across geographical regions, developing region-specific ISLR datasets is crucial for supporting communication and research. Auslan, as a sign language specific to Australia, still lacks a dedicated large-scale word-level dataset for the ISLR task. To fill this gap, we curate \underline{\textbf{the first}} large-scale Multi-view Multi-modal Word-Level Australian Sign Language recognition dataset, dubbed MM-WLAuslan. Compared to other publicly available datasets, MM-WLAuslan exhibits three significant advantages: (1) the largest amount of data, (2) the most extensive vocabulary, and (3) the most diverse of multi-modal camera views. Specifically, we record 282K+ sign videos covering 3,215 commonly used Auslan glosses presented by 73 signers in a studio environment. Moreover, our filming system includes two different types of cameras, i.e., three Kinect-V2 cameras and a RealSense camera. We position cameras hemispherically around the front half of the model and simultaneously record videos using all four cameras. Furthermore, we benchmark results with state-of-the-art methods for various multi-modal ISLR settings on MM-WLAuslan, including multi-view, cross-camera, and cross-view. Experiment results indicate that MM-WLAuslan is a challenging ISLR dataset, and we hope this dataset will contribute to the development of Auslan and the advancement of sign languages worldwide.

Existing algorithms are often developed and evaluated using idealized datasets, which deviate significantly from real-life scenarios characterized by environmental noise and data corruption such as fluctuating lighting conditions, variable object poses, and unstable camera positions. To address this gap, we introduce the Realistic Anomaly Detection (RAD) dataset, the first multi-view RGB-based anomaly detection dataset specifically collected using a real robot arm, providing unique and realistic data scenarios. RAD comprises 4765 images across 13 categories and 4 defect types, collected from more than 50 viewpoints, providing a comprehensive and realistic benchmark. This multi-viewpoint setup mirrors real-world conditions where anomalies may not be detectable from every perspective. Moreover, by sampling varying numbers of views, the algorithm's performance can be comprehensively evaluated across different viewpoints. This approach enhances the thoroughness of performance assessment and helps improve the algorithm's robustness. Besides, to support 3D multi-view reconstruction algorithms, we propose a data augmentation method to improve the accuracy of pose estimation and facilitate the reconstruction of 3D point clouds. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art RGB-based and point cloud-based models using RAD, identifying limitations and future research directions.

Vehicle Color Recognition (VCR) has garnered significant research interest because color is a visually distinguishable attribute of vehicles and is less affected by partial occlusion and changes in viewpoint. Despite the success of existing methods for this task, the relatively low complexity of the datasets used in the literature has been largely overlooked. This research addresses this gap by compiling a new dataset representing a more challenging VCR scenario. The images - sourced from six license plate recognition datasets - are categorized into eleven colors, and their annotations were validated using official vehicle registration information. We evaluate the performance of four deep learning models on a widely adopted dataset and our proposed dataset to establish a benchmark. The results demonstrate that our dataset poses greater difficulty for the tested models and highlights scenarios that require further exploration in VCR. Remarkably, nighttime scenes account for a significant portion of the errors made by the best-performing model. This research provides a foundation for future studies on VCR, while also offering valuable insights for the field of fine-grained vehicle classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI) 2024</p></details> | None |

TAGs are graphs with node and edge features represented in text, which have recently gained wide applicability in training graph-language or graph foundation models. In TAGLAS, we collect and integrate more than 23 TAG datasets with domains ranging from citation graphs to molecule graphs and tasks from node classification to graph question-answering. Unlike previous graph datasets and benchmarks, all datasets in TAGLAS have a unified node and edge text feature format, which allows a graph model to be simultaneously trained and evaluated on multiple datasets from various domains.

| **[Few-Shot Classification of Interactive Activities of Daily Living (InteractADL)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01662v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is a crucial step for different applications including assistive robots, smart homes, and healthcare. However, to date, few benchmarks and methods have focused on complex ADLs, especially those involving multi-person interactions in home environments. In this paper, we propose a new dataset and benchmark, InteractADL, for understanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and objects). Furthermore, complex ADLs occurring in home environments comprise a challenging long-tailed distribution due to the rarity of multi-person interactions, and pose fine-grained visual recognition tasks due to the presence of semantically and visually similar classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for fine-grained few-shot video classification called Name Tuning that enables greater semantic separability by learning optimal class name vectors. We show that Name Tuning can be combined with existing prompt tuning strategies to learn the entire input text (rather than only learning the prompt or class names) and demonstrate improved performance for few-shot classification on InteractADL and 4 other fine-grained visual classification benchmarks. For transparency and reproducibility, we release our code at https://github.com/zanedurante/vlm_benchmark.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zanedurante/vlm_benchmark) |
| **[Mini-Splatting: Representing Scenes with a Constrained Number of Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14166v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we explore the challenge of efficiently representing scenes with a constrained number of Gaussians. Our analysis shifts from traditional graphics and 2D computer vision to the perspective of point clouds, highlighting the inefficient spatial distribution of Gaussian representation as a key limitation in model performance. To address this, we introduce strategies for densification including blur split and depth reinitialization, and simplification through intersection preserving and sampling. These techniques reorganize the spatial positions of the Gaussians, resulting in significant improvements across various datasets and benchmarks in terms of rendering quality, resource consumption, and storage compression. Our Mini-Splatting integrates seamlessly with the original rasterization pipeline, providing a strong baseline for future research in Gaussian-Splatting-based works. \href{https://github.com/fatPeter/mini-splatting}{Code is available}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/fatPeter/mini-splatting) |
| **[$\textit{lucie}$: An Improved Python Package for Loading Datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09119v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The University of California--Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning (ML) Repository (UCIMLR) is consistently cited as one of the most popular dataset repositories, hosting hundreds of high-impact datasets. However, a significant portion, including 28.4% of the top 250, cannot be imported via the $\textit{ucimlrepo}$ package that is provided and recommended by the UCIMLR website. Instead, they are hosted as .zip files, containing nonstandard formats that are difficult to import without additional ad hoc processing. To address this issue, here we present $\textit{lucie}$ -- $\underline{l}oad$ $\underline{U}niversity$ $\underline{C}alifornia$ $\underline{I}rvine$ $\underline{e}xamples$ -- a utility that automatically determines the data format and imports many of these previously non-importable datasets, while preserving as much of a tabular data structure as possible. $\textit{lucie}$ was designed using the top 100 most popular datasets and benchmarked on the next 130, where it resulted in a success rate of 95.4% vs. 73.1% for $\textit{ucimlrepo}$. $\textit{lucie}$ is available as a Python package on PyPI with 98% code coverage.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[SpatialRGPT: Grounded Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01584v3)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in 2D vision and language tasks. However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, effectively reasoning about complex spatial relations and functioning as a region-aware dense reward annotator for robotic tasks.

| **[How far are today's time-series models from real-world weather forecasting applications?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14399v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Time-Series Forecasting (TSF) techniques is often hindered by the lack of comprehensive datasets. This is particularly problematic for time-series weather forecasting, where commonly used datasets suffer from significant limitations such as small size, limited temporal coverage, and sparse spatial distribution. These constraints severely impede the optimization and evaluation of TSF models, resulting in benchmarks that are not representative of real-world applications, such as operational weather forecasting. In this work, we introduce the WEATHER-5K dataset, a comprehensive collection of observational weather data that better reflects real-world scenarios. As a result, it enables a better training of models and a more accurate assessment of the real-world forecasting capabilities of TSF models, pushing them closer to in-situ applications. Through extensive benchmarking against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, we provide researchers with a clear assessment of the gap between academic TSF models and real-world weather forecasting applications. This highlights the significant performance disparity between TSF and NWP models by analyzing performance across detailed weather variables, extreme weather event prediction, and model complexity comparison. Finally, we summarise the result into recommendations to the users and highlight potential areas required to facilitate further TSF research. The dataset and benchmark implementation are available at: https://github.com/taohan10200/WEATHER-5K.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/taohan10200/WEATHER-5K) |
| **[Recent Advances of Multimodal Continual Learning: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05352v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to empower machine learning models to learn continually from new data, while building upon previously acquired knowledge without forgetting. As machine learning models have evolved from small to large pre-trained architectures, and from supporting unimodal to multimodal data, multimodal continual learning (MMCL) methods have recently emerged. The primary challenge of MMCL is that it goes beyond a simple stacking of unimodal CL methods, as such straightforward approaches often yield unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survey on MMCL. We provide essential background knowledge and MMCL settings, as well as a structured taxonomy of MMCL methods. We categorize existing MMCL methods into four categories, i.e., regularization-based, architecture-based, replay-based, and prompt-based methods, explaining their methodologies and highlighting their key innovations. Additionally, to prompt further research in this field, we summarize open MMCL datasets and benchmarks, and discuss several promising future directions for investigation and development. We have also created a GitHub repository for indexing relevant MMCL papers and open resources available at https://github.com/LucyDYu/Awesome-Multimodal-Continual-Learning.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/LucyDYu/Awesome-Multimodal-Continual-Learning) |
| **[MMHead: Towards Fine-grained Multi-modal 3D Facial Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07757v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D facial animation has attracted considerable attention due to its extensive applications in the multimedia field. Audio-driven 3D facial animation has been widely explored with promising results. However, multi-modal 3D facial animation, especially text-guided 3D facial animation is rarely explored due to the lack of multi-modal 3D facial animation dataset. To fill this gap, we first construct a large-scale multi-modal 3D facial animation dataset, MMHead, which consists of 49 hours of 3D facial motion sequences, speech audios, and rich hierarchical text annotations. Each text annotation contains abstract action and emotion descriptions, fine-grained facial and head movements (i.e., expression and head pose) descriptions, and three possible scenarios that may cause such emotion. Concretely, we integrate five public 2D portrait video datasets, and propose an automatic pipeline to 1) reconstruct 3D facial motion sequences from monocular videos; and 2) obtain hierarchical text annotations with the help of AU detection and ChatGPT. Based on the MMHead dataset, we establish benchmarks for two new tasks: text-induced 3D talking head animation and text-to-3D facial motion generation. Moreover, a simple but efficient VQ-VAE-based method named MM2Face is proposed to unify the multi-modal information and generate diverse and plausible 3D facial motions, which achieves competitive results on both benchmarks. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the significant potential of our dataset and benchmarks in promoting the development of multi-modal 3D facial animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2024.
