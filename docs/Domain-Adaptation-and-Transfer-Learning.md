| **[Improving Transfer Learning for Sequence Labeling Tasks by Adapting Pre-trained Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20033v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted transfer learning paradigms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TMT: Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation with Region-adaptive Transferability Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05774v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced semantic segmentation performance. However, their adaptation to new target domains remains challenged by distribution shifts, which often disrupt global attention mechanisms. While existing global and patch-level adaptation methods offer some improvements, they overlook the spatially varying transferability inherent in different image regions. To address this, we propose the Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a region-adaptive framework designed to enhance cross-domain representation learning through transferability guidance. First, we dynamically partition the image into coherent regions, grouped by structural and semantic similarity, and estimates their domain transferability at a localized level. Then, we incorporate region-level transferability maps directly into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, allowing the model to adaptively focus attention on areas with lower transferability and higher semantic uncertainty. Extensive experiments across 20 diverse cross-domain settings demonstrate that TMT not only mitigates the performance degradation typically associated with domain shift but also consistently outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation based on Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08393v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MPCA-based Domain Adaptation for Transfer Learning in Ultrasonic Guided Waves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02726v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques. Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Deep Transfer Learning-Based Low-overhead Beam Prediction in Vehicle Communications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20659v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing transfer learning-based beam prediction approaches primarily rely on simple fine-tuning. When there is a significant difference in data distribution between the target domain and the source domain, simple fine-tuning limits the model's performance in the target domain. To tackle this problem, we propose a transfer learning-based beam prediction method that combines fine-tuning with domain adaptation. We integrate a domain classifier into fine-tuning the pre-trained model. The model extracts domain-invariant features in adversarial training with domain classifier, which can enhance model performance in the target domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transfer learning-based beam prediction method achieves better achievable rate performance than the pure fine-tuning method in the target domain, and close to those when the training is done from scratch on the target domain.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Robust Domain Adaptation in Medical Time Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22393v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the sixth Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL 2025), PMLR 287:502-526, 2025.

| **[FetalSleepNet: A Transfer Learning Framework with Spectral Equalisation Domain Adaptation for Fetal Sleep Stage Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10082v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introduction: This study presents FetalSleepNet, the first published deep learning approach to classifying sleep states from the ovine electroencephalogram (EEG). Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and laborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage classification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation associated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth restriction). Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal cortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network originally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG using transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain adaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch. Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full fine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall performance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming baseline models. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep learning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the fetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier functions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling and distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be acquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data. FetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low power, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 tables, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> | None |
| **[Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14100v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots, as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Robotic Systems and Applications</p></details> | None |
| **[Transfer Learning for Neutrino Scattering: Domain Adaptation with GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12987v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.</p></details> | 17 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[Tackling Distribution Shift in LLM via KILO: Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03571v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation), a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FAST: Similarity-based Knowledge Transfer for Efficient Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20433v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer, leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) 2025</p></details> | None |

Our framework begins with a pretrained VQC configured in one domain and calculates the transition of 1-parameter unitary subgroups required for a new domain. A formalism is established to investigate the adaptability and capability of a VQC under the analysis of loss bounds. Our theory observes knowledge transfer in VQCs and provides a heuristic interpretation for the mechanism. An analytical fine-tuning method is derived to attain the optimal transition for adaptations of similar domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network: Enhancing Transfer Learning in Reinforcement Learning Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03026v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network (GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600, MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments, and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive chatbots and robotic control.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[M3D: Manifold-based Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution for Non-Deep Transfer Learning in Cross-subject and Cross-session EEG-based Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15615v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion decoding using Electroencephalography (EEG)-based affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) plays a crucial role in affective computing but is limited by challenges such as EEG's non-stationarity, individual variability, and the high cost of large labeled datasets. While deep learning methods are effective, they require extensive computational resources and large data volumes, limiting their practical application. To overcome these issues, we propose Manifold-based Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution (M3D), a lightweight, non-deep transfer learning framework. M3D consists of four key modules: manifold feature transformation, dynamic distribution alignment, classifier learning, and ensemble learning. The data is mapped to an optimal Grassmann manifold space, enabling dynamic alignment of source and target domains. This alignment is designed to prioritize both marginal and conditional distributions, improving adaptation efficiency across diverse datasets. In classifier learning, the principle of structural risk minimization is applied to build robust classification models. Additionally, dynamic distribution alignment iteratively refines the classifier. The ensemble learning module aggregates classifiers from different optimization stages to leverage diversity and enhance prediction accuracy. M3D is evaluated on two EEG emotion recognition datasets using two validation protocols (cross-subject single-session and cross-subject cross-session) and a clinical EEG dataset for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Experimental results show that M3D outperforms traditional non-deep learning methods with a 4.47% average improvement and achieves deep learning-level performance with reduced data and computational requirements, demonstrating its potential for real-world aBCI applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Predicting Onflow Parameters Using Transfer Learning for Domain and Task Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14784v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy data is concluded to be not as effective.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Konooz: Multi-domain Multi-dialect Corpus for Named Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12615v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Konooz, a novel multi-dimensional corpus covering 16 Arabic dialects across 10 domains, resulting in 160 distinct corpora. The corpus comprises about 777k tokens, carefully collected and manually annotated with 21 entity types using both nested and flat annotation schemes - using the Wojood guidelines. While Konooz is useful for various NLP tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning, this paper primarily focuses on benchmarking existing Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, especially cross-domain and cross-dialect model performance. Our benchmarking of four Arabic NER models using Konooz reveals a significant drop in performance of up to 38% when compared to the in-distribution data. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of domain and dialect divergence and the impact of resource scarcity. We also measured the overlap between domains and dialects using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, and illustrated why certain NER models perform better on specific dialects and domains. Konooz is open-source and publicly available at https://sina.birzeit.edu/wojood/#download</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On the Transferability and Discriminability of Repersentation Learning in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22099v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we addressed the limitation of relying solely on distribution alignment and source-domain empirical risk minimization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Our information-theoretic analysis showed that this standard adversarial-based framework neglects the discriminability of target-domain features, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this theoretical-practical gap, we defined "good representation learning" as guaranteeing both transferability and discriminability, and proved that an additional loss term targeting target-domain discriminability is necessary. Building on these insights, we proposed a novel adversarial-based UDA framework that explicitly integrates a domain alignment objective with a discriminability-enhancing constraint. Instantiated as Domain-Invariant Representation Learning with Global and Local Consistency (RLGLC), our method leverages Asymmetrically-Relaxed Wasserstein of Wasserstein Distance (AR-WWD) to address class imbalance and semantic dimension weighting, and employs a local consistency mechanism to preserve fine-grained target-domain discriminative information. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RLGLC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, confirming the value of our theoretical perspective and underscoring the necessity of enforcing both transferability and discriminability in adversarial-based UDA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Domain Diffusion with Progressive Alignment for Efficient Adaptive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13907v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, while maintaining low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency. However, existing methods typically fail to address potential noise in the target domain, and directly align high-level features across domains, thus resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Diffusion with Progressive Alignment method (COUPLE). This approach revisits unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval from a graph diffusion perspective, simulating cross-domain adaptation dynamics to achieve a stable target domain adaptation process. First, we construct a cross-domain relationship graph and leverage noise-robust graph flow diffusion to simulate the transfer dynamics from the source domain to the target domain, identifying lower noise clusters. We then leverage the graph diffusion results for discriminative hash code learning, effectively learning from the target domain while reducing the negative impact of noise. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical Mixup operation for progressive domain alignment, which is performed along the cross-domain random walk paths. Utilizing target domain discriminative hash learning and progressive domain alignment, COUPLE enables effective domain adaptive hash learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate COUPLE's effectiveness on competitive benchmarks.</p></details> | IEEE TIP | None |
| **[On the Mechanisms of Adversarial Data Augmentation for Robust and Adaptive Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12681v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training, improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home -- demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for cross-domain transferability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Colors to Classes: Emergence of Concepts in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24071v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) are increasingly utilized in various computer vision tasks due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, it remains understudied how ViTs process information layer by layer. Numerous studies have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract features of increasing complexity throughout their layers, which is crucial for tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning. ViTs, lacking the same inductive biases as CNNs, can potentially learn global dependencies from the first layers due to their attention mechanisms. Given the increasing importance of ViTs in computer vision, there is a need to improve the layer-wise understanding of ViTs. In this work, we present a novel, layer-wise analysis of concepts encoded in state-of-the-art ViTs using neuron labeling. Our findings reveal that ViTs encode concepts with increasing complexity throughout the network. Early layers primarily encode basic features such as colors and textures, while later layers represent more specific classes, including objects and animals. As the complexity of encoded concepts increases, the number of concepts represented in each layer also rises, reflecting a more diverse and specific set of features. Additionally, different pretraining strategies influence the quantity and category of encoded concepts, with finetuning to specific downstream tasks generally reducing the number of encoded concepts and shifting the concepts to more relevant categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[From Abstraction to Reality: DARPA's Vision for Robust Sim-to-Real Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11007v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DARPA Transfer from Imprecise and Abstract Models to Autonomous Technologies (TIAMAT) program aims to address rapid and robust transfer of autonomy technologies across dynamic and complex environments, goals, and platforms. Existing methods for simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer often rely on high-fidelity simulations and struggle with broad adaptation, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios. Although many approaches have shown incredible performance at specific tasks, most techniques fall short when posed with unforeseen, complex, and dynamic real-world scenarios due to the inherent limitations of simulation. In contrast to current research that aims to bridge the gap between simulation environments and the real world through increasingly sophisticated simulations and a combination of methods typically assuming a small sim-to-real gap -- such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning, policy distillation, and dynamic optimization -- TIAMAT takes a different approach by instead emphasizing transfer and adaptation of the autonomy stack directly to real-world environments by utilizing a breadth of low(er)-fidelity simulations to create broadly effective sim-to-real transfers. By abstractly learning from multiple simulation environments in reference to their shared semantics, TIAMAT's approaches aim to achieve abstract-to-real transfer for effective and rapid real-world adaptation. Furthermore, this program endeavors to improve the overall autonomy pipeline by addressing the inherent challenges in translating simulated behaviors into effective real-world performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Safe Continual Domain Adaptation after Sim2Real Transfer of Reinforcement Learning Policies in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10949v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain randomization has emerged as a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning (RL) to facilitate the transfer of policies from simulation to real-world robotic applications. Many existing domain randomization approaches have been proposed to improve robustness and sim2real transfer. These approaches rely on wide randomization ranges to compensate for the unknown actual system parameters, leading to robust but inefficient real-world policies. In addition, the policies pretrained in the domain-randomized simulation are fixed after deployment due to the inherent instability of the optimization processes based on RL and the necessity of sampling exploitative but potentially unsafe actions on the real system. This limits the adaptability of the deployed policy to the inevitably changing system parameters or environment dynamics over time. We leverage safe RL and continual learning under domain-randomized simulation to address these limitations and enable safe deployment-time policy adaptation in real-world robot control. The experiments show that our method enables the policy to adapt and fit to the current domain distribution and environment dynamics of the real system while minimizing safety risks and avoiding issues like catastrophic forgetting of the general policy found in randomized simulation during the pretraining phase.

| **[Transfer Learning through Enhanced Sufficient Representation: Enriching Source Domain Knowledge with Target Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20414v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning is an important approach for addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability in various applications. It accomplishes this by transferring knowledge from well-established source domains to a less familiar target domain. However, traditional transfer learning methods often face difficulties due to rigid model assumptions and the need for a high degree of similarity between source and target domain models. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for transfer learning called Transfer learning through Enhanced Sufficient Representation (TESR). Our approach begins by estimating a sufficient and invariant representation from the source domains. This representation is then enhanced with an independent component derived from the target data, ensuring that it is sufficient for the target domain and adaptable to its specific characteristics. A notable advantage of TESR is that it does not rely on assuming similar model structures across different tasks. For example, the source domain models can be regression models, while the target domain task can be classification. This flexibility makes TESR applicable to a wide range of supervised learning problems. We explore the theoretical properties of TESR and validate its performance through simulation studies and real-world data applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in finite sample settings.</p></details> | 44 pages | None |
| **[Investigating Continual Pretraining in Large Language Models: Insights and Implications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17400v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) in large language models (LLMs) is an evolving domain that focuses on developing efficient and sustainable training strategies to adapt models to emerging knowledge and achieve robustness in dynamic environments. Our primary emphasis is on continual domain-adaptive pretraining, a process designed to equip LLMs with the ability to integrate new information from various domains while retaining previously learned knowledge. Since existing works concentrate mostly on continual fine-tuning for a limited selection of downstream tasks or training domains, we introduce a new benchmark designed to measure the adaptability of LLMs to changing pretraining data landscapes. We further examine the impact of model size on learning efficacy and forgetting, as well as how the progression and similarity of emerging domains affect the knowledge transfer within these models. Our findings uncover several key insights: (i) continual pretraining consistently improves <1.5B models studied in this work and is also superior to domain adaptation, (ii) larger models always achieve better perplexity than smaller ones when continually pretrained on the same corpus, (iii) smaller models are particularly sensitive to continual pretraining, showing the most significant rates of both learning and forgetting, (iv) continual pretraining boosts downstream task performance of GPT-2 family, (v) continual pretraining enables LLMs to specialize better when the sequence of domains shows semantic similarity while randomizing training domains leads to better transfer and final performance otherwise. We posit that our research establishes a new benchmark for CL in LLMs, providing a more realistic evaluation of knowledge retention and transfer across diverse domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Model-Robust and Adaptive-Optimal Transfer Learning for Tackling Concept Shifts in Nonparametric Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10870v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When concept shifts and sample scarcity are present in the target domain of interest, nonparametric regression learners often struggle to generalize effectively. The technique of transfer learning remedies these issues by leveraging data or pre-trained models from similar source domains. While existing generalization analyses of kernel-based transfer learning typically rely on correctly specified models, we present a transfer learning procedure that is robust against model misspecification while adaptively attaining optimality. To facilitate our analysis and avoid the risk of saturation found in classical misspecified results, we establish a novel result in the misspecified single-task learning setting, showing that spectral algorithms with fixed bandwidth Gaussian kernels can attain minimax convergence rates given the true function is in a Sobolev space, which may be of independent interest. Building on this, we derive the adaptive convergence rates of the excess risk for specifying Gaussian kernels in a prevalent class of hypothesis transfer learning algorithms. Our results are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors and elucidate the key determinants of transfer efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Graph Domain Adaptation: Challenges, Progress and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00904v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As graph representation learning often suffers from label scarcity problems in real-world applications, researchers have proposed graph domain adaptation (GDA) as an effective knowledge-transfer paradigm across graphs. In particular, to enhance model performance on target graphs with specific tasks, GDA introduces a bunch of task-related graphs as source graphs and adapts the knowledge learnt from source graphs to the target graphs. Since GDA combines the advantages of graph representation learning and domain adaptation, it has become a promising direction of transfer learning on graphs and has attracted an increasing amount of research interest in recent years. In this paper, we comprehensively overview the studies of GDA and present a detailed survey of recent advances. Specifically, we outline the research status and challenges, propose a taxonomy, introduce the details of representative works, and discuss the prospects. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for graph domain adaptation.

In this paper, we propose a vector quantized meta learning for transferable sequential recommenders (MetaRec). Without requiring additional modalities or shared information across domains, our approach leverages user-item interactions from multiple source domains to improve the target domain performance. To solve the input heterogeneity issue, we adopt vector quantization that maps item embeddings from heterogeneous input spaces to a shared feature space. Moreover, our meta transfer paradigm exploits limited target data to guide the transfer of source domain knowledge to the target domain (i.e., learn to transfer). In addition, MetaRec adaptively transfers from multiple source tasks by rescaling meta gradients based on the source-target domain similarity, enabling selective learning to improve recommendation performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, where MetaRec consistently outperforms baseline methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BigData 2024</p></details> | None |

As two types of the most common and intuitive thermal adaptive behaviors, precise recognition of dressing and undressing can effectively support thermal comfort prediction. However, traditional activity recognition suffers from shortcomings in privacy, cost, and performance. To address the above issues, this study proposes a cross-domain transfer learning method for human dressing and undressing adaptive behavior recognition with WiFi. First, we determine the activity interval by calculating the sliding variance for denoised WiFi signals. Subsequently, short-time Fourier transform and discrete wavelet transform are performed to extract action information on the basis of time-frequency analysis. Ultimately, an efficient 1D CNN pre-trained model is integrated with the SVM algorithm as a hybrid model to enhance the identification robustness in new scenarios. Experiment results show that the hybrid model based on transfer learning provides a more accurate prediction for the adaptative behavior of target subjects, achieving 96.9% and 94.9% accuracy in two cases, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, the use of prompts or adapters for efficient transfer learning (ETL) has gained significant attention for effectively adapting to downstream tasks. However, previous studies have overlooked the challenge of varying transfer difficulty of downstream tasks. In this paper, we empirically analyze how each ETL method behaves with respect to transfer difficulty. Our observations indicate that utilizing vision prompts and text adapters is crucial for adaptability and generalizability in domains with high difficulty. Also, by applying an adaptive ensemble approach that integrates task-adapted VLMs with pre-trained VLMs and strategically leverages more general knowledge in low-difficulty and less in high-difficulty domains, we consistently enhance performance across both types of domains. Based on these observations, we propose an adaptive ensemble method that combines visual prompts and text adapters with pre-trained VLMs, tailored by transfer difficulty, to achieve optimal performance for any target domain. Upon experimenting with extensive benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly on unseen tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024; code available at: https://github.com/YangYongJin/APEX</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/YangYongJin/APEX) |

However, graphs with topology and attributes usually have considerable cross-domain disparity and there are numerous real-world scenarios where merely a subset of nodes are labeled in the source graph. This imposes critical challenges on graph transfer learning due to serious domain shifts and label scarcity. To address these challenges, we propose a method named Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SGDA). To deal with the domain shift, we add adaptive shift parameters to each of the source nodes, which are trained in an adversarial manner to align the cross-domain distributions of node embedding, thus the node classifier trained on labeled source nodes can be transferred to the target nodes. Moreover, to address the label scarcity, we propose pseudo-labeling on unlabeled nodes, which improves classification on the target graph via measuring the posterior influence of nodes based on their relative position to the class centroids. Finally, extensive experiments on a range of publicly accessible datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed SGDA in different experimental settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2023</p></details> | None |

Despite its high flexibility and generality, MGP still faces two critical challenges when applied to transfer learning. The first one is negative transfer, which occurs when there exists no shared information among the outputs. The second challenge is the input domain inconsistency, which is commonly studied in transfer learning yet not explored in MGP. In this paper, we propose a regularized MGP modeling framework with domain adaptation to overcome these challenges. More specifically, a sparse covariance matrix of MGP is proposed by using convolution process, where penalization terms are added to adaptively select the most informative outputs for knowledge transfer. To deal with the domain inconsistency, a domain adaptation method is proposed by marginalizing inconsistent features and expanding missing features to align the input domains among different outputs. Statistical properties of the proposed method are provided to guarantee the performance practically and asymptotically. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in comprehensive simulation studies and one real case study of a ceramic manufacturing process. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in dealing with both the negative transfer and the domain inconsistency.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate identification of various skin ailments, ranging from cancer to inflammatory diseases, is paramount. However, existing artificial intelligence (AI) models in dermatology face challenges, particularly in accurately diagnosing diseases across diverse skin tones, with a notable performance gap in darker skin. Additionally, the scarcity of publicly available, unbiased datasets hampers the development of inclusive AI diagnostic tools. To tackle the challenges in accurately predicting skin conditions across diverse skin tones, we employ a transfer-learning approach that capitalizes on the rich, transferable knowledge from various image domains. Our method integrates multiple pre-trained models from a wide range of sources, including general and specific medical images, to improve the robustness and inclusiveness of the skin condition predictions. We rigorously evaluated the effectiveness of these models using the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset, which uniquely encompasses both underrepresented and common skin tones, making it an ideal benchmark for assessing our approach. Among all methods, Med-ViT emerged as the top performer due to its comprehensive feature representation learned from diverse image sources. To further enhance performance, we conducted domain adaptation using additional skin image datasets such as HAM10000. This adaptation significantly improved model performance across all models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning to Prompt Your Domain for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03103v5)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has recently become a very efficient transfer learning paradigm for Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) models. Compared with fine-tuning the entire encoder, prompt learning can obtain highly competitive results by optimizing only a small number of parameters, which presents considerably exciting benefits for federated learning applications that prioritizes communication efficiency. However, in this work, we identify that directly transferring prompt learning approaches into federated learning does not yield favorable results since the model often suffers from considerable domain gaps across different clients. To address this issue, we propose ADAPT, a novel domain-aware prompt learning approach that facilitates both intra- and inter-domain prompts across federated participants. The basic idea of ADAPT is that the prompted CLIP should detect the input image's domain correspondence and before making the prediction of its category. Extensive experiments of ADAPT demonstrate its significant efficiency and effectiveness in federated learning. For example, by learning and sharing only 0.08M parameters, our ADAPT attains a 68.4% average accuracy over six domains in the DomainNet dataset, which improves the original CLIP by a large margin of 14.8%.</p></details> |  | None |

Solving this problem is important, as new forgeries emerge daily with the continuously evolving generative techniques. Many efforts have been made for this issue by seeking the commonly existing traces empirically on data level. In this paper, we rethink this problem and propose a new solution from the unsupervised domain adaptation perspective. Our solution, called DomainForensics, aims to transfer the forgery knowledge from known forgeries to new forgeries. Unlike recent efforts, our solution does not focus on data view but on learning strategies of DeepFake detectors to capture the knowledge of new forgeries through the alignment of domain discrepancies. In particular, unlike the general domain adaptation methods which consider the knowledge transfer in the semantic class category, thus having limited application, our approach captures the subtle forgery traces. We describe a new bi-directional adaptation strategy dedicated to capturing the forgery knowledge across domains. Specifically, our strategy considers both forward and backward adaptation, to transfer the forgery knowledge from the source domain to the target domain in forward adaptation and then reverse the adaptation from the target domain to the source domain in backward adaptation. In forward adaptation, we perform supervised training for the DeepFake detector in the source domain and jointly employ adversarial feature adaptation to transfer the ability to detect manipulated faces from known forgeries to new forgeries. In backward adaptation, we further improve the knowledge transfer by coupling adversarial adaptation with self-distillation on new forgeries. This enables the detector to expose new forgery features from unlabeled data and avoid forgetting the known knowledge of known...</p></details> | TIFS 2024 | None |
| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Lane Detection via Contextual Contrast and Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13328v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on two crucial issues in domain-adaptive lane detection, i.e., how to effectively learn discriminative features and transfer knowledge across domains. Existing lane detection methods usually exploit a pixel-wise cross-entropy loss to train detection models. However, the loss ignores the difference in feature representation among lanes, which leads to inefficient feature learning. On the other hand, cross-domain context dependency crucial for transferring knowledge across domains remains unexplored in existing lane detection methods. This paper proposes a method of Domain-Adaptive lane detection via Contextual Contrast and Aggregation (DACCA), consisting of two key components, i.e., cross-domain contrastive loss and domain-level feature aggregation, to realize domain-adaptive lane detection. The former can effectively differentiate feature representations among categories by taking domain-level features as positive samples. The latter fuses the domain-level and pixel-level features to strengthen cross-domain context dependency. Extensive experiments show that DACCA significantly improves the detection model's performance and outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptive lane detection methods on six datasets, especially achieving the best performance when transferring from CULane to Tusimple (92.10% accuracy), Tusimple to CULane (41.9% F1 score), OpenLane to CULane (43.0% F1 score), and CULane to OpenLane (27.6% F1 score).</p></details> |  | None |

The sample space of them is merely a small subset of the entire space, making it challenging to train an efficient model. In recent years, there have been many excellent studies related to cross-domain recommendation aimed at mitigating the problem of data sparsity. However, few of them have simultaneously considered the adaptability of both sample and representation continual transfer setting to the target task. To overcome the above issue, we propose a Entire space Continual and Adaptive Transfer learning framework called ECAT which includes two core components: First, as for sample transfer, we propose a two-stage method that realizes a coarse-to-fine process. Specifically, we perform an initial selection through a graph-guided method, followed by a fine-grained selection using domain adaptation method. Second, we propose an adaptive knowledge distillation method for continually transferring the representations from a model that is well-trained on the entire space dataset. ECAT enables full utilization of the entire space samples and representations under the supervision of the target task, while avoiding negative migration. Comprehensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets from Taobao show that ECAT advances state-of-the-art performance on offline metrics, and brings +13.6% CVR and +8.6% orders for Baiyibutie, a famous mini-app of Taobao.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the discrepancy in distribution across domains, the key challenge is how to select good source instances and how to adapt the model. Diverse graph structures further complicate this problem, rendering previous MSUDA approaches less effective. In this work, we present the framework Selective Multi-source Adaptation for Graph ({\method}), with a graph-modeling-based domain selector, a sub-graph node selector, and a bi-level alignment objective for the adaptation. Concretely, to facilitate the identification of informative source data, the similarity across graphs is disentangled and measured with the transferability of a graph-modeling task set, and we use it as evidence for source domain selection. A node selector is further incorporated to capture the variation in transferability of nodes within the same source domain. To learn invariant features for adaptation, we align the target domain to selected source data both at the embedding space by minimizing the optimal transport distance and at the classification level by distilling the label function. Modules are explicitly learned to select informative source data and conduct the alignment in virtual training splits with a meta-learning strategy. Experimental results on five graph datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, for a specific target task, it is cumbersome to collect related and high-quality source domains. In real-world scenarios, large-scale datasets corrupted with noisy labels are easy to collect, stimulating a great demand for automatic recognition in a generalized setting, i.e., weakly-supervised partial domain adaptation (WS-PDA), which transfers a classifier from a large source domain with noises in labels to a small unlabeled target domain. As such, the key issues of WS-PDA are: 1) how to sufficiently discover the knowledge from the noisy labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain, and 2) how to successfully adapt the knowledge across domains. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective domain adaptation approach, termed as self-paced transfer classifier learning (SP-TCL), to address the above issues, which could be regarded as a well-performing baseline for several generalized domain adaptation tasks. The proposed model is established upon the self-paced learning scheme, seeking a preferable classifier for the target domain. Specifically, SP-TCL learns to discover faithful knowledge via a carefully designed prudent loss function and simultaneously adapts the learned knowledge to the target domain by iteratively excluding source examples from training under the self-paced fashion. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SP-TCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several generalized domain adaptation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TIP 2024.

To address these two issues, this paper proposes a domain adaptive attention learning approach to reliably transfer discriminative representation from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. In this approach, a domain adaptive attention model is learned to separate the feature map into domain-shared part and domain-specific part. In this manner, the domain-shared part is used to capture transferable cues that can compensate cross-dataset distinctions and give positive contributions to the target task, while the domain-specific part aims to model the noisy information to avoid the negative transfer caused by domain diversity. A soft label loss is further employed to take full use of unlabeled target data by estimating pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on the Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 benchmarks demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite significant advances in representation disentanglement to capture diverse user preferences, existing methods usually neglect representation enhancement and lack rigorous decoupling constraints, thereby limiting the transfer of relevant information. To this end, we propose a Unified Framework for Adaptive Representation Enhancement and Inversed Learning in Cross-Domain Recommendation (AREIL). Specifically, we first divide user embeddings into domain-shared and domain-specific components to disentangle mixed user preferences. Then, we incorporate intra-domain and inter-domain information to adaptively enhance the ability of user representations. In particular, we propose a graph convolution module to capture high-order information, and a self-attention module to reveal inter-domain correlations and accomplish adaptive fusion. Next, we adopt domain classifiers and gradient reversal layers to achieve inversed representation learning in a unified framework. Finally, we employ a cross-entropy loss for measuring recommendation performance and jointly optimize the entire framework via multi-task learning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the substantial improvement in the recommendation performance of AREIL. Moreover, ablation studies and representation visualizations further illustrate the effectiveness of adaptive enhancement and inversed learning in CDR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DASFAA 2024</p></details> | None |

However, irrelevant information from the source domain may instead degrade target domain performance, which is known as the negative transfer problem. There have been some attempts to address this problem, mostly by designing adaptive representations for overlapped users. Whereas, representation adaptions solely rely on the expressive capacity of the CDR model, lacking explicit constraint to filter the irrelevant source-domain collaborative information for the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative information regularized User Transformation (CUT) framework to tackle the negative transfer problem by directly filtering users' collaborative information. In CUT, user similarity in the target domain is adopted as a constraint for user transformation learning to filter the user collaborative information from the source domain. CUT first learns user similarity relationships from the target domain. Then, source-target information transfer is guided by the user similarity, where we design a user transformation layer to learn target-domain user representations and a contrastive loss to supervise the user collaborative information transferred. The results show significant performance improvement of CUT compared with SOTA single and cross-domain methods. Further analysis of the target-domain results illustrates that CUT can effectively alleviate the negative transfer problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> | None |

Recently, Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) has emerged as an effective technique, closing this gap by utilizing a series of intermediate domains. This paper contributes a novel CDA method, W-MPOT, which rigorously addresses the domain ordering and error accumulation problems overlooked by previous studies. Specifically, we construct a transfer curriculum over the source and intermediate domains based on Wasserstein distance, motivated by theoretical analysis of CDA. Then we transfer the source model to the target domain through multiple valid paths in the curriculum using a modified version of continuous optimal transport. A bidirectional path consistency constraint is introduced to mitigate the impact of accumulated mapping errors during continuous transfer. We extensively evaluate W-MPOT on multiple datasets, achieving up to 54.1\% accuracy improvement on multi-session Alzheimer MR image classification and 94.7\% MSE reduction on battery capacity estimation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present a new few-shot domain adaptation framework SAMDA, which combines the Segment Anything Model(SAM) with nnUNet in the embedding space to achieve high transferability and accuracy. Specifically, we choose the Unet-based network as the "expert" component to learn segmentation features efficiently and design a SAM-based adaptation module as the "generic" component for domain transfer. By amalgamating the "generic" and "expert" components, we mitigate the modality imbalance in the complex pre-training knowledge inherent to large-scale Vision Foundation models and the challenge of transferability inherent to traditional neural networks. The effectiveness of our model is evaluated on two electron microscopic image datasets with different modalities for mitochondria segmentation, which improves the dice coefficient on the target domain by 6.7%. Also, the SAM-based adaptor performs significantly better with only a single annotated image than the 10-shot domain adaptation on nnUNet. We further verify our model on four MRI datasets from different sources to prove its generalization ability.</p></details> |  | None |

While such procedurally and intuitively plausible methods have achieved great success in a wide range of real-world applications, the lack of a theoretical basis hinders further methodological development. This paper presents a general class of transfer learning regression called affine model transfer, following the principle of expected-square loss minimization. It is shown that the affine model transfer broadly encompasses various existing methods, including the most common procedure based on neural feature extractors. Furthermore, the current paper clarifies theoretical properties of the affine model transfer such as generalization error and excess risk. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the practical benefits of modeling and estimating inter-domain commonality and domain-specific factors separately with the affine-type transfer models.</p></details> | 34 pages | None |
| **[Multi-source adversarial transfer learning for ultrasound image segmentation with limited similarity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19069v1)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lesion segmentation of ultrasound medical images based on deep learning techniques is a widely used method for diagnosing diseases. Although there is a large amount of ultrasound image data in medical centers and other places, labeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no datasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the possibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural images that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant features that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration between ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of public datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source domains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information, and there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images, which may cause negative transfer. To this end, a multi-source adversarial transfer learning network for ultrasound image segmentation is proposed. Specifically, to address the lack of annotations, the idea of adversarial transfer learning is used to adaptively extract common features between a certain pair of source and target domains, which provides the possibility to utilize unlabeled ultrasound data. To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a single source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse knowledge from multiple source domains. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the fusion and maximize the use of precious data, a multi-source domain independent strategy is also proposed to improve the estimation of the target domain data distribution, which further increases the learning ability of the multi-source adversarial migration learning network in multiple domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Applied Soft Computing Journal</p></details> | None |

However, in new shale gas blocks, two main challenges are encountered: (1) the occurrence of negative transfer due to insufficient data, and (2) the limited interpretability of deep learning (DL) models. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel transfer learning methodology that utilizes domain adaptation and physical constraints. This methodology effectively employs historical data from the source domain to reduce negative transfer from the data distribution perspective, while also using physical constraints to build a robust and reliable prediction model that integrates various types of data. The methodology starts by dividing the production data from the source domain into multiple subdomains, thereby enhancing data diversity. It then uses Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and global average distance measures to decide on the feasibility of transfer. Through domain adaptation, we integrate all transferable knowledge, resulting in a more comprehensive target model. Lastly, by incorporating drilling, completion, and geological data as physical constraints, we develop a hybrid model. This model, a combination of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a Transformer (Transformer-MLP), is designed to maximize interpretability. Experimental validation in China's southwestern region confirms the method's effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adapt in Contexts: Retrieval-Augmented Domain Adaptation via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11551v1)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have showcased their capability with few-shot inference known as in-context learning. However, in-domain demonstrations are not always readily available in real scenarios, leading to cross-domain in-context learning. Besides, LLMs are still facing challenges in long-tail knowledge in unseen and unfamiliar domains. The above limitations demonstrate the necessity of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). In this paper, we study the UDA problem under an in-context learning setting to adapt language models from the source domain to the target domain without any target labels. The core idea is to retrieve a subset of cross-domain elements that are the most similar to the query, and elicit language model to adapt in an in-context manner by learning both target domain distribution and the discriminative task signal simultaneously with the augmented cross-domain in-context examples. We devise different prompting and training strategies, accounting for different LM architectures to learn the target distribution via language modeling. With extensive experiments on Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, we thoroughly study the effectiveness of ICL for domain transfer and demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 | None |
| **[Quantifying the value of information transfer in population-based SHM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03083v1)** | 2023-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM), seeks to address some of the limitations associated with data scarcity that arise in traditional SHM. A tenet of the population-based approach to SHM is that information can be shared between sufficiently-similar structures in order to improve predictive models. Transfer learning techniques, such as domain adaptation, have been shown to be a highly-useful technology for sharing information between structures when developing statistical classifiers for PBSHM. Nonetheless, transfer-learning techniques are not without their pitfalls. In some circumstances, for example if the data distributions associated with the structures within a population are dissimilar, applying transfer-learning methods can be detrimental to classification performance -- this phenomenon is known as negative transfer. Given the potentially-severe consequences of negative transfer, it is prudent for engineers to ask the question `when, what, and how should one transfer between structures?'. The current paper aims to demonstrate a transfer-strategy decision process for a classification task for a population of simulated structures in the context of a representative SHM maintenance problem, supported by domain adaptation. The transfer decision framework is based upon the concept of expected value of information transfer. In order to compute the expected value of information transfer, predictions must be made regarding the classification (and decision performance) in the target domain following information transfer. In order to forecast the outcome of transfers, a probabilistic regression is used here to predict classification performance from a proxy for structural similarity based on the modal assurance criterion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 42nd IMAC: A Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics (IMAC-XLII), 2024</p></details> | None |

Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is a promising solution that utilizes knowledge from the source domain to improve the recommendation performance in the target domain. Previous CDR approaches have mainly followed the Embedding and Mapping (EMCDR) framework, which involves learning a mapping function to facilitate knowledge transfer. However, these approaches necessitate re-engineering and re-training the network structure to incorporate transferrable knowledge, which can be computationally expensive and may result in catastrophic forgetting of the original knowledge. In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient paradigm to address data sparsity and cold-start issues in CDR, named CDR-Adapter, by decoupling the original recommendation model from the mapping function, without requiring re-engineering the network structure. Specifically, CDR-Adapter is a novel plug-and-play module that employs adapter modules to align feature representations, allowing for flexible knowledge transfer across different domains and efficient fine-tuning with minimal training costs. We conducted extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach over several state-of-the-art CDR approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, Proceedings of the 46th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval Workshop on eCommerce</p></details> | None |
| **[On the Transferability of Learning Models for Semantic Segmentation for Remote Sensing Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10490v1)** | 2023-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning-based methods outperform traditional learning methods on remote sensing (RS) semantic segmentation/classification tasks. However, they require large training datasets and are generally known for lack of transferability due to the highly disparate RS image content across different geographical regions. Yet, there is no comprehensive analysis of their transferability, i.e., to which extent a model trained on a source domain can be readily applicable to a target domain. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to investigate the raw transferability of traditional and deep learning (DL) models, as well as the effectiveness of domain adaptation (DA) approaches in enhancing the transferability of the DL models (adapted transferability). By utilizing four highly diverse RS datasets, we train six models with and without three DA approaches to analyze their transferability between these datasets quantitatively. Furthermore, we developed a straightforward method to quantify the transferability of a model using the spectral indices as a medium and have demonstrated its effectiveness in evaluating the model transferability at the target domain when the labels are unavailable. Our experiments yield several generally important yet not well-reported observations regarding the raw and adapted transferability. Moreover, our proposed label-free transferability assessment method is validated to be better than posterior model confidence. The findings can guide the future development of generalized RS learning models.

At present, a surge of work focuses on designing deep interpretable methods with adequate data annotations and only a few methods consider the distributional shift problem. Most existing interpretable UDA methods are post-hoc ones, which cannot facilitate the model learning process for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose an inherently interpretable method, named Transferable Conceptual Prototype Learning (TCPL), which could simultaneously interpret and improve the processes of knowledge transfer and decision-making in UDA. To achieve this goal, we design a hierarchically prototypical module that transfers categorical basic concepts from the source domain to the target domain and learns domain-shared prototypes for explaining the underlying reasoning process. With the learned transferable prototypes, a self-predictive consistent pseudo-label strategy that fuses confidence, predictions, and prototype information, is designed for selecting suitable target samples for pseudo annotations and gradually narrowing down the domain gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method can not only provide effective and intuitive explanations but also outperform previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TIP</p></details> | None |
| **[Transferable Deep Clustering Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04946v1)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has shown remarkable success in the field of clustering recently. However, how to transfer a trained clustering model on a source domain to a target domain by leveraging the acquired knowledge to guide the clustering process remains challenging. Existing deep clustering methods often lack generalizability to new domains because they typically learn a group of fixed cluster centroids, which may not be optimal for the new domain distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel transferable deep clustering model that can automatically adapt the cluster centroids according to the distribution of data samples. Rather than learning a fixed set of centroids, our approach introduces a novel attention-based module that can adapt the centroids by measuring their relationship with samples. In addition, we theoretically show that our model is strictly more powerful than some classical clustering algorithms such as k-means or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed transfer learning framework, which significantly improves the performance on target domain and reduces the computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Confidence-based Visual Dispersal for Few-shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15575v2)** | 2023-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from a fully-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, in real-world scenarios, providing abundant labeled data even in the source domain can be infeasible due to the difficulty and high expense of annotation. To address this issue, recent works consider the Few-shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FUDA) where only a few source samples are labeled, and conduct knowledge transfer via self-supervised learning methods. Yet existing methods generally overlook that the sparse label setting hinders learning reliable source knowledge for transfer. Additionally, the learning difficulty difference in target samples is different but ignored, leaving hard target samples poorly classified. To tackle both deficiencies, in this paper, we propose a novel Confidence-based Visual Dispersal Transfer learning method (C-VisDiT) for FUDA. Specifically, C-VisDiT consists of a cross-domain visual dispersal strategy that transfers only high-confidence source knowledge for model adaptation and an intra-domain visual dispersal strategy that guides the learning of hard target samples with easy ones. We conduct extensive experiments on Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-C, and DomainNet benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed C-VisDiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FUDA methods.

Transfer learning has been a feasible way to transfer knowledge from high-quality external data of source domains to limited data of target domains, which follows a domain-level knowledge transfer to learn a shared posterior distribution. However, they are usually built on strong assumptions, e.g., the domain invariant posterior distribution, which is usually unsatisfied and may introduce noises, resulting in poor generalization ability on target domains. Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that aggregate information from neighboring nodes, we redefine the paradigm as learning a knowledge-enhanced posterior distribution for target domains, namely Knowledge Bridge Learning (KBL). KBL first learns the scope of knowledge transfer by constructing a Bridged-Graph that connects knowledgeable samples to each target sample and then performs sample-wise knowledge transfer via GNNs.KBL is free from strong assumptions and is robust to noises in the source data. Guided by KBL, we propose the Bridged-GNN} including an Adaptive Knowledge Retrieval module to build Bridged-Graph and a Graph Knowledge Transfer module. Comprehensive experiments on both un-relational and relational data-hungry scenarios demonstrate the significant improvements of Bridged-GNN compared with SOTA methods</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2023 | None |

Previous methods fine-tune pre-trained models with various side information and learning strategies to learn a compact feature space that is shared between the sketch and photo domains and bridges seen and unseen classes. However, these efforts are inadequate in adapting domains and transferring knowledge from seen to unseen classes. In this paper, we present an effective ``Adapt and Align'' approach to address the key challenges. Specifically, we insert simple and lightweight domain adapters to learn new abstract concepts of the sketch domain and improve cross-domain representation capabilities. Inspired by recent advances in image-text foundation models (e.g., CLIP) on zero-shot scenarios, we explicitly align the learned image embedding with a more semantic text embedding to achieve the desired knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes.

The premise of effective learning is to collect sufficient data. However, in time series forecasting, it is difficult to obtain enough data, which limits the performance of neural forecasting models. To alleviate the data scarcity limitation, we design Sequence Decomposition Adaptation Network (SeDAN) which is a novel transfer architecture to improve forecasting performance on the target domain by aligning transferable knowledge from cross-domain datasets. Rethinking the transferability of features in time series data, we propose Implicit Contrastive Decomposition to decompose the original features into components including seasonal and trend features, which are easier to transfer. Then we design the corresponding adaptation methods for decomposed features in different domains. Specifically, for seasonal features, we perform joint distribution adaptation and for trend features, we design an Optimal Local Adaptation. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets for multivariate time series forecasting. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SeDAN. It can provide more efficient and stable knowledge transfer.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures | None |

To achieve this, we have created a theatre human action recognition system that uses skeleton data captured by depth image as input. We collected new samples of human actions in a theatre environment, and then tested the transfer learning technique with three pre-trained Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks for skeleton-based human action recognition: the spatio-temporal graph convolution network, the two-stream adaptive graph convolution network, and the multi-scale disentangled unified graph convolution network. We selected the NTU-RGBD human action benchmark as the source domain and used our collected dataset as the target domain. We analyzed the transferability of the pre-trained models and proposed two configurations to apply and adapt the transfer learning technique to the diversity between the source and target domains. The use of transfer learning helped to improve the performance of the human action system within the context of theatre. The results indicate that Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks is positively transferred, and there was an improvement in performance compared to the baseline without transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 18 figures, research paper not published</p></details> | None |

However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2023; 29 pages (14 pages main paper + 15 pages supplementary materials).

Many traditional approaches of domain adaptation in RL manage to learn a mapping function between the source and target domain in explicit or implicit ways. However, they typically require access to abundant data from the target domain. Besides, they often rely on visual clues to learn the mapping function and may fail when the source domain looks quite different from the target domain. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework Online Prototype Alignment (OPA) to learn the mapping function based on the functional similarity of elements and is able to achieve the few-shot policy transfer within only several episodes. The key insight of OPA is to introduce an exploration mechanism that can interact with the unseen elements of the target domain in an efficient and purposeful manner, and then connect them with the seen elements in the source domain according to their functionalities (instead of visual clues). Experimental results show that when the target domain looks visually different from the source domain, OPA can achieve better transfer performance even with much fewer samples from the target domain, outperforming prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at ICML2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Deep into The Domain Shift: Transfer Learning through Dependence Regularization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19499v1)** | 2023-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical Domain Adaptation methods acquire transferability by regularizing the overall distributional discrepancies between features in the source domain (labeled) and features in the target domain (unlabeled). They often do not differentiate whether the domain differences come from the marginals or the dependence structures. In many business and financial applications, the labeling function usually has different sensitivities to the changes in the marginals versus changes in the dependence structures. Measuring the overall distributional differences will not be discriminative enough in acquiring transferability. Without the needed structural resolution, the learned transfer is less optimal. This paper proposes a new domain adaptation approach in which one can measure the differences in the internal dependence structure separately from those in the marginals. By optimizing the relative weights among them, the new regularization strategy greatly relaxes the rigidness of the existing approaches. It allows a learning machine to pay special attention to places where the differences matter the most. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the improvements are quite notable and robust compared to various benchmark domain adaptation models.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

Prior efforts have focused on developing pre-training algorithms on domains such as lung ultrasound, chest X-ray, and liver CT to bridge domain gaps. However, we find that model fine-tuning also plays a crucial role in adapting medical knowledge to target tasks. The common fine-tuning method is manually picking transferable layers (e.g., the last few layers) to update, which is labor-expensive. In this work, we propose a meta-learning-based LR tuner, named MetaLR, to make different layers automatically co-adapt to downstream tasks based on their transferabilities across domains. MetaLR learns appropriate LRs for different layers in an online manner, preventing highly transferable layers from forgetting their medical representation abilities and driving less transferable layers to adapt actively to new domains. Extensive experiments on various medical applications show that MetaLR outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) fine-tuning strategies. Codes are released.</p></details> | MICCAI 2023 | None |

This incentivizes developing domain adaptation methods that leverage the knowledge in known domains (source) and adapt to new domains (target) with a different probability distribution. This becomes more challenging when the source and target domains are in heterogeneous feature spaces, known as heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). While most HDA methods utilize mathematical optimization to map source and target data to a common space, they suffer from low transferability. Neural representations have proven to be more transferable; however, they are mainly designed for homogeneous environments. Drawing on the theory of domain adaptation, we propose a novel framework, Heterogeneous Adversarial Neural Domain Adaptation (HANDA), to effectively maximize the transferability in heterogeneous environments. HANDA conducts feature and distribution alignment in a unified neural network architecture and achieves domain invariance through adversarial kernel learning. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance against the state-of-the-art HDA methods on major image and text e-commerce benchmarks. HANDA shows statistically significant improvement in predictive performance. The practical utility of HANDA was shown in real-world dark web online markets.

| **[Context-aware Domain Adaptation for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07453v1)** | 2023-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is a challenging task with a wide range of real-world applications. Due to label sparsity, training a deep anomaly detector often relies on unsupervised approaches. Recent efforts have been devoted to time series domain adaptation to leverage knowledge from similar domains. However, existing solutions may suffer from negative knowledge transfer on anomalies due to their diversity and sparsity. Motivated by the empirical study of context alignment between two domains, we aim to transfer knowledge between two domains via adaptively sampling context information for two domains. This is challenging because it requires simultaneously modeling the complex in-domain temporal dependencies and cross-domain correlations while exploiting label information from the source domain. To this end, we propose a framework that combines context sampling and anomaly detection into a joint learning procedure. We formulate context sampling into the Markov decision process and exploit deep reinforcement learning to optimize the time series domain adaptation process via context sampling and design a tailored reward function to generate domain-invariant features that better align two domains for anomaly detection. Experiments on three public datasets show promise for knowledge transfer between two similar domains and two entirely different domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Various DA methods have achieved remarkable results recently in terms of predicting ability, which implies the effectiveness of the aforementioned knowledge transferring. However, state-of-the-art methods rarely probe deeper into the transferred mechanism, leaving the true essence of such knowledge obscure. Recognizing its importance in the adaptation process, we propose an interpretive model of unsupervised domain adaptation, as the first attempt to visually unveil the mystery of transferred knowledge. Adapting the existing concept of the prototype from visual image interpretation to the DA task, our model similarly extracts shared information from the domain-invariant representations as prototype vectors. Furthermore, we extend the current prototype method with our novel prediction calibration and knowledge fidelity preservation modules, to orientate the learned prototypes to the actual transferred knowledge. By visualizing these prototypes, our method not only provides an intuitive explanation for the base model's predictions but also unveils transfer knowledge by matching the image patches with the same semantics across both source and target domains. Comprehensive experiments and in-depth explorations demonstrate the efficacy of our method in understanding the transferred mechanism and its potential in downstream tasks including model diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On the Hardness of Robustness Transfer: A Perspective from Rademacher Complexity over Symmetric Difference Hypothesis Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12351v1)** | 2023-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies demonstrated that the adversarially robust learning under $\ell_\infty$ attack is harder to generalize to different domains than standard domain adaptation. How to transfer robustness across different domains has been a key question in domain adaptation field. To investigate the fundamental difficulty behind adversarially robust domain adaptation (or robustness transfer), we propose to analyze a key complexity measure that controls the cross-domain generalization: the adversarial Rademacher complexity over {\em symmetric difference hypothesis space} $\mathcal{H} Δ\mathcal{H}$. For linear models, we show that adversarial version of this complexity is always greater than the non-adversarial one, which reveals the intrinsic hardness of adversarially robust domain adaptation. We also establish upper bounds on this complexity measure. Then we extend them to the ReLU neural network class by upper bounding the adversarial Rademacher complexity in the binary classification setting. Finally, even though the robust domain adaptation is provably harder, we do find positive relation between robust learning and standard domain adaptation. We explain \emph{how adversarial training helps domain adaptation in terms of standard risk}. We believe our results initiate the study of the generalization theory of adversarially robust domain adaptation, and could shed lights on distributed adversarially robust learning from heterogeneous sources, e.g., federated learning scenario.</p></details> |  | None |

The task aims to improve legal judgment predictions for non-professional fact descriptions. We formulate this task as a partial-and-imbalanced domain adaptation problem. Though deep domain adaptation has achieved cutting-edge performance in many unsupervised domain adaptation tasks. However, due to the negative transfer of samples in non-shared classes, it is hard for current domain adaptation model to solve the partial-and-imbalanced transfer problem. In this work, we explore large-scale non-shared but related classes data in the source domain with a hierarchy weighting adaptation to tackle this limitation. We propose to embed a novel pArtial Imbalanced Domain Adaptation technique (AIDA) in the deep learning model, which can jointly borrow sibling knowledge from non-shared classes to shared classes in the source domain and further transfer the shared classes knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Discriminative Radial Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00383v2)** | 2023-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation methods reduce domain shift typically by learning domain-invariant features. Most existing methods are built on distribution matching, e.g., adversarial domain adaptation, which tends to corrupt feature discriminability. In this paper, we propose Discriminative Radial Domain Adaptation (DRDA) which bridges source and target domains via a shared radial structure. It's motivated by the observation that as the model is trained to be progressively discriminative, features of different categories expand outwards in different directions, forming a radial structure. We show that transferring such an inherently discriminative structure would enable to enhance feature transferability and discriminability simultaneously. Specifically, we represent each domain with a global anchor and each category a local anchor to form a radial structure and reduce domain shift via structure matching. It consists of two parts, namely isometric transformation to align the structure globally and local refinement to match each category. To enhance the discriminability of the structure, we further encourage samples to cluster close to the corresponding local anchors based on optimal-transport assignment. Extensively experimenting on multiple benchmarks, our method is shown to consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on varied tasks, including the typical unsupervised domain adaptation, multi-source domain adaptation, domain-agnostic learning, and domain generalization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures | None |

These technologies have a long history of application in production and have had numerous positive impacts, but also hold great potential when integrated with Industry 4.0 and advanced machine learning, particularly deep learning, solutions. However, in order to implement these solutions in production and enable widespread adoption, the scalability and transferability of deep learning methods have become a focus of research. While transfer learning has proven successful in many cases, particularly with computer vision and homogenous data inputs, it can be challenging to apply to heterogeneous data. Motivated by the need to transfer and standardize established processes to different, non-identical environments and by the challenge of adapting to heterogeneous data representations, this work introduces the Domain Adaptation Neural Network with Cyclic Supervision (DBACS) approach. DBACS addresses the issue of model generalization through domain adaptation, specifically for heterogeneous data, and enables the transfer and scalability of deep learning-based statistical control methods in a general manner. Additionally, the cyclic interactions between the different parts of the model enable DBACS to not only adapt to the domains, but also match them. To the best of our knowledge, DBACS is the first deep learning approach to combine adaptation and matching for heterogeneous data settings. For comparison, this work also includes subspace alignment and a multi-view learning that deals with heterogeneous representations by mapping data into correlated latent feature spaces. Finally, DBACS with its ability to adapt and match, is applied to a virtual metrology use case for an etching process run on different machine types in semiconductor manufacturing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Transferable Parameters for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06129v1)** | 2022-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift. Thanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent remarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features. Intuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the hypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target domain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source hypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade the generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper, motivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are essential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are essential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in UDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other parameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize, which we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose Transferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by domain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the memorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the distribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and untransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate updates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image classification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar outperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA networks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Progress in each domain is driven by a growing body of annotated data, increased computational resources, and technological innovations. In medicine, the sensitivity of the data, the complexity of the tasks, the potentially high stakes, and a requirement of accountability give rise to a particular set of challenges. In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. (1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. (2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. (3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted in IEEE CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, Nov. 10 2022</p></details> | None |

However, it remains an open question, if and when transfer learning will work, i.e. leading to positive or negative transfer. In this paper, we analyze the knowledge transfer across three natural language processing (NLP) tasks - text classification, sentimental analysis, and sentence similarity, using three LLMs - BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet - and analyzing their performance, by fine-tuning on target datasets for domain and cross-lingual adaptation tasks, with and without an intermediate task training on a larger dataset. Our experiments showed that fine-tuning without an intermediate task training can lead to a better performance for most tasks, while more generalized tasks might necessitate a preceding intermediate task training step. We hope that this work will act as a guide on transfer learning to NLP practitioners.</p></details> | 1 figure, 1 table | None |
| **[MDT-Net: Multi-domain Transfer by Perceptual Supervision for Unpaired Images in OCT Scan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06363v2)** | 2022-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models tend to underperform in the presence of domain shifts. Domain transfer has recently emerged as a promising approach wherein images exhibiting a domain shift are transformed into other domains for augmentation or adaptation. However, with the absence of paired and annotated images, models merely learned by adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss could result in poor consistency of anatomy structures during the translation. Additionally, the complexity of learning multi-domain transfer could significantly increase with the number of target domains and source images. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain transfer network, named MDT-Net, to address the limitations above through perceptual supervision. Specifically, our model consists of a single encoder-decoder network and multiple domain-specific transfer modules to disentangle feature representations of the anatomy content and domain variance. Owing to this architecture, the model could significantly reduce the complexity when the translation is conducted among multiple domains. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we evaluate our model qualitatively and quantitatively on RETOUCH, an OCT dataset comprising scans from three different scanner devices (domains). Furthermore, we take the transfer results as additional training data for fluid segmentation to prove the advantage of our model indirectly, i.e., in the task of data adaptation and augmentation. Experimental results show that our method could bring universal improvement in these segmentation tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of MDT-Net in multi-domain transfer.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Consecutive Knowledge Meta-Adaptation Learning for Unsupervised Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10425v1)** | 2022-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has attracted appealing attention in academic researches and clinical applications. Nevertheless, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) diagnosis system heavily relies on the well-labeled lesion dataset, and the sensitivity to the variation of data distribution also restricts the potential application of CNNs in CAD. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods are developed to solve the expensive annotation and domain gaps problem and have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis. Yet existing UDA approaches only adapt knowledge learned from the source lesion domain to a single target lesion domain, which is against the clinical scenario: the new unlabeled target domains to be diagnosed always arrive in an online and continual manner. Moreover, the performance of existing approaches degrades dramatically on previously learned target lesion domains, due to the newly learned knowledge overwriting the previously learned knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). To deal with the above issues, we develop a meta-adaptation framework named Consecutive Lesion Knowledge Meta-Adaptation (CLKM), which mainly consists of Semantic Adaptation Phase (SAP) and Representation Adaptation Phase (RAP) to learn the diagnosis model in an online and continual manner. In the SAP, the semantic knowledge learned from the source lesion domain is transferred to consecutive target lesion domains. In the RAP, the feature-extractor is optimized to align the transferable representation knowledge across the source and multiple target lesion domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Unbiased Transferability for Domain Adaptation by Uncertainty Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01319v3)** | 2022-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled or a less labeled but related target domain. Ideally, the source and target distributions should be aligned to each other equally to achieve unbiased knowledge transfer. However, due to the significant imbalance between the amount of annotated data in the source and target domains, usually only the target distribution is aligned to the source domain, leading to adapting unnecessary source specific knowledge to the target domain, i.e., biased domain adaptation. To resolve this problem, in this work, we delve into the transferability estimation problem in domain adaptation and propose a non-intrusive Unbiased Transferability Estimation Plug-in (UTEP) by modeling the uncertainty of a discriminator in adversarial-based DA methods to optimize unbiased transfer. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach to unbiased transferability learning in DA. Furthermore, to alleviate the impact of imbalanced annotated data, we utilize the estimated uncertainty for pseudo label selection of unlabeled samples in the target domain, which helps achieve better marginal and conditional distribution alignments between domains. Extensive experimental results on a high variety of DA benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach can be readily incorporated into various adversarial-based DA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ECCV2022</p></details> | None |

This is because most learning algorithms strongly rely on the i.i.d.~assumption on source/target data, which is often violated in practice due to domain shift. Domain generalization (DG) aims to achieve OOD generalization by using only source data for model learning. Over the last ten years, research in DG has made great progress, leading to a broad spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment, meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, to name a few; DG has also been studied in various application areas including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, medical imaging, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, for the first time a comprehensive literature review in DG is provided to summarize the developments over the past decade. Specifically, we first cover the background by formally defining DG and relating it to other relevant fields like domain adaptation and transfer learning. Then, we conduct a thorough review into existing methods and theories. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2022</p></details> | None |

It aims to leverage the label information in a partially labeled source network to assist node classification in a completely unlabeled or partially labeled target network. Existing methods for single network learning cannot solve this problem due to the domain shift across networks. Some multi-network learning methods heavily rely on the existence of cross-network connections, thus are inapplicable for this problem. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel \textcolor{black}{graph} transfer learning framework AdaGCN by leveraging the techniques of adversarial domain adaptation and graph convolution. It consists of two components: a semi-supervised learning component and an adversarial domain adaptation component. The former aims to learn class discriminative node representations with given label information of the source and target networks, while the latter contributes to mitigating the distribution divergence between the source and target domains to facilitate knowledge transfer. Extensive empirical evaluations on real-world datasets show that AdaGCN can successfully transfer class information with a low label rate on the source network and a substantial divergence between the source and target domains.

While domain transfer methods (e.g., domain adaptation, domain generalization) have been proposed to learn transferable representations across domains, they are typically applied to ResNet backbones pre-trained on ImageNet. Thus, existing works pay little attention to the effects of pre-training on domain transfer tasks. In this paper, we provide a broad study and in-depth analysis of pre-training for domain adaptation and generalization, namely: network architectures, size, pre-training loss, and datasets. We observe that simply using a state-of-the-art backbone outperforms existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation baselines and set new baselines on Office-Home and DomainNet improving by 10.7\% and 5.5\%. We hope that this work can provide more insights for future domain transfer research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-Correction Adaptation Network for Noisy Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04423v1)** | 2022-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods aim to promote target learning via a single-directional knowledge transfer from label-rich source domain to unlabeled target domain, while its reverse adaption from target to source has not jointly been considered yet so far. In fact, in some real teaching practice, a teacher helps students learn while also gets promotion from students to some extent, which inspires us to explore a dual-directional knowledge transfer between domains, and thus propose a Dual-Correction Adaptation Network (DualCAN) in this paper. However, due to the asymmetrical label knowledge across domains, transfer from unlabeled target to labeled source poses a more difficult challenge than the common source-to-target counterpart. First, the target pseudo-labels predicted by source commonly involve noises due to model bias, hence in the reverse adaptation, they may hurt the source performance and bring a negative target-to-source transfer. Secondly, source domain usually contains innate noises, which will inevitably aggravate the target noises, leading to noise amplification across domains. To this end, we further introduce a Noise Identification and Correction (NIC) module to correct and recycle noises in both domains. To our best knowledge, this is the first naive attempt of dual-directional adaptation for noisy UDA, and naturally applicable to noise-free UDA. A theory justification is given to state the rationality of our intuition. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness of DualCAN with remarkable performance gains over state-of-the-arts, particularly for extreme noisy tasks (e.g., ~+ 15% on Pw->Pr and Pr->Rw of Office-Home).</p></details> |  | None |

Finetuning requires modifying all of the parameters and having enough data to avoid overfitting while prompting requires no training and few examples but limits performance. Instead, we prepare PLMs for data- and parameter-efficient adaptation by learning to learn the difference between general and adapted PLMs. This difference is expressed in terms of model weights and sublayer structure through our proposed dynamic low-rank reparameterization and learned architecture controller. Experiments on few-shot dialogue completion, low-resource abstractive summarization, and multi-domain language modeling show improvements in adaptation time and performance over direct finetuning or preparation via domain-adaptive pretraining. Ablations show our task-adaptive reparameterization (TARP) and model search (TAMS) components individually improve on other parameter-efficient transfer like adapters and structure-learning methods like learned sparsification.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose DAML-ATM (Domain Adaptive Meta-Learning with Adversarial Transfer Model), which consists of two parts: DAML and ATM. DAML is a domain adaptive meta-learning approach to learn general knowledge in multiple heterogeneous source domains, capable of adapting to new unseen domains with a small amount of data. Moreover, we propose a new unsupervised TST approach Adversarial Transfer Model (ATM), composed of a sequence-to-sequence pre-trained language model and uses adversarial style training for better content preservation and style transfer. Results on multi-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach generalizes well on unseen low-resource domains, achieving state-of-the-art results against ten strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept in NAACL 2022(oral)</p></details> | None |

Recent works show that contrastive representations can transfer across domains, leading to simple state-of-the-art algorithms for unsupervised domain adaptation. In particular, a linear classifier trained to separate the representations on the source domain can also predict classes on the target domain accurately, even though the representations of the two domains are far from each other. We refer to this phenomenon as linear transferability. This paper analyzes when and why contrastive representations exhibit linear transferability in a general unsupervised domain adaptation setting. We prove that linear transferability can occur when data from the same class in different domains (e.g., photo dogs and cartoon dogs) are more related with each other than data from different classes in different domains (e.g., photo dogs and cartoon cats) are. Our analyses are in a realistic regime where the source and target domains can have unbounded density ratios and be weakly related, and they have distant representations across domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing studies in this task attach more attention to the sequence modeling of sentences while largely ignoring the rich domain-invariant semantics embedded in graph structures (i.e., the part-of-speech tags and dependency relations). As an important aspect of exploring characteristics of language comprehension, adaptive graph representations have played an essential role in recent years. To this end, in the paper, we aim to explore the possibility of learning invariant semantic features from graph-like structures in CDSC. Specifically, we present Graph Adaptive Semantic Transfer (GAST) model, an adaptive syntactic graph embedding method that is able to learn domain-invariant semantics from both word sequences and syntactic graphs. More specifically, we first raise a POS-Transformer module to extract sequential semantic features from the word sequences as well as the part-of-speech tags. Then, we design a Hybrid Graph Attention (HGAT) module to generate syntax-based semantic features by considering the transferable dependency relations. Finally, we devise an Integrated aDaptive Strategy (IDS) to guide the joint learning process of both modules. Extensive experiments on four public datasets indicate that GAST achieves comparable effectiveness to a range of state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, Sigir 2022</p></details> | None |

Recently, mainstream approaches perform this task through adversarial learning, yet still suffer from two limitations. First, they mainly align marginal distribution by unsupervised cross-domain feature matching, and ignore each feature's categorical and positional information that can be exploited for conditional alignment; Second, they treat all classes as equally important for transferring cross-domain knowledge and ignore that different classes usually have different transferability. In this paper, we propose a joint adaptive detection framework (JADF) to address the above challenges. First, an end-to-end joint adversarial adaptation framework for object detection is proposed, which aligns both marginal and conditional distributions between domains without introducing any extra hyperparameter. Next, to consider the transferability of each object class, a metric for class-wise transferability assessment is proposed, which is incorporated into the JADF objective for domain adaptation. Further, an extended study from unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to unsupervised few-shot domain adaptation (UFDA) is conducted, where only a few unlabeled training images are available in unlabeled target domain. Extensive experiments validate that JADF is effective in both the UDA and UFDA settings, achieving significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art cross-domain detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE T-MM, 2021, the code is available at https://github.com/BOBrown/JADF-caffe</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/BOBrown/JADF-caffe) |

Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been proposed to alleviate this so-called domain shift issue, but most of them are designed for scenarios with relatively small domain shifts and are likely to fail when encountering a large domain gap. In this paper, we propose DCDA, a novel cross-modality unsupervised domain adaptation framework for tasks with large domain shifts, e.g., segmenting retinal vessels from OCTA and OCT images. DCDA mainly consists of a disentangling representation style transfer (DRST) module and a collaborative consistency learning (CCL) module. DRST decomposes images into content components and style codes and performs style transfer and image reconstruction. CCL contains two segmentation models, one for source domain and the other for target domain. The two models use labeled data (together with the corresponding transferred images) for supervised learning and perform collaborative consistency learning on unlabeled data. Each model focuses on the corresponding single domain and aims to yield an expertized domain-specific segmentation model. Through extensive experiments on retinal vessel segmentation, our framework achieves Dice scores close to target-trained oracle both from OCTA to OCT and from OCT to OCTA, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ISBI 2022</p></details> | None |

Such an ability to acquire and reuse knowledge is known as transferability in deep learning. It has formed the long-term quest towards making deep learning as data-efficient as human learning, and has been motivating fruitful design of more powerful deep learning algorithms. We present this survey to connect different isolated areas in deep learning with their relation to transferability, and to provide a unified and complete view to investigating transferability through the whole lifecycle of deep learning. The survey elaborates the fundamental goals and challenges in parallel with the core principles and methods, covering recent cornerstones in deep architectures, pre-training, task adaptation and domain adaptation. This highlights unanswered questions on the appropriate objectives for learning transferable knowledge and for adapting the knowledge to new tasks and domains, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer.

To better leverage the potential of these well-trained models in intra-domain or cross-domain transfer learning situations, knowledge distillation (KD) and domain adaptation (DA) are proposed and become research highlights. They both aim to transfer useful information from a well-trained model with original training data. However, the original data is not always available in many cases due to privacy, copyright or confidentiality. Recently, the data-free knowledge transfer paradigm has attracted appealing attention as it deals with distilling valuable knowledge from well-trained models without requiring to access to the training data. In particular, it mainly consists of the data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) and source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA). On the one hand, DFKD aims to transfer the intra-domain knowledge of original data from a cumbersome teacher network to a compact student network for model compression and efficient inference. On the other hand, the goal of SFDA is to reuse the cross-domain knowledge stored in a well-trained source model and adapt it to a target domain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on data-free knowledge transfer from the perspectives of knowledge distillation and unsupervised domain adaptation, to help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Applications and challenges of the two areas are briefly reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, we provide some insights to the subject of future research.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures | None |

Most existing UDA methods require access to the source data, and thus are not applicable when the data are confidential and not shareable due to privacy concerns. This paper aims to tackle a realistic setting with only a classification model available trained over, instead of accessing to, the source data. To effectively utilize the source model for adaptation, we propose a novel approach called Source HypOthesis Transfer (SHOT), which learns the feature extraction module for the target domain by fitting the target data features to the frozen source classification module (representing classification hypothesis). Specifically, SHOT exploits both information maximization and self-supervised learning for the feature extraction module learning to ensure the target features are implicitly aligned with the features of unseen source data via the same hypothesis. Furthermore, we propose a new labeling transfer strategy, which separates the target data into two splits based on the confidence of predictions (labeling information), and then employ semi-supervised learning to improve the accuracy of less-confident predictions in the target domain. We denote labeling transfer as SHOT++ if the predictions are obtained by SHOT. Extensive experiments on both digit classification and object recognition tasks show that SHOT and SHOT++ achieve results surpassing or comparable to the state-of-the-arts, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approaches for various visual domain adaptation problems.

| **[TVT: Transferable Vision Transformer for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05988v2)** | 2021-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge learnt from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work is mainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn domain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in applying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in adapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the transferability of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly, ViT demonstrates superior transferability over its CNNs-based counterparts with a large margin, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating adversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation strategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g., attention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an important role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified framework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the transferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately devise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption Module (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM compels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we leverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation which are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its versatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/uta-smile/TVT</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/uta-smile/TVT) |

In this work, we investigate the problem of UDA from a synthetic computer-generated domain to a similar but real-world domain for learning semantic segmentation. We propose a semantically consistent image-to-image translation method in combination with a consistency regularisation method for UDA. We overcome previous limitations on transferring synthetic images to real looking images. We leverage pseudo-labels in order to learn a generative image-to-image translation model that receives additional feedback from semantic labels on both domains. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods that combine image-to-image translation and semi-supervised learning on relevant domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., on GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Adapter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00667v1)** | 2021-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with pre-trained language models (PrLM) has achieved promising results since these pre-trained models embed generic knowledge learned from various domains. However, fine-tuning all the parameters of the PrLM on a small domain-specific corpus distort the learned generic knowledge, and it is also expensive to deployment a whole fine-tuned PrLM for each domain. This paper explores an adapter-based fine-tuning approach for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, several trainable adapter modules are inserted in a PrLM, and the embedded generic knowledge is preserved by fixing the parameters of the original PrLM at fine-tuning. A domain-fusion scheme is introduced to train these adapters using a mix-domain corpus to better capture transferable features. Elaborated experiments on two benchmark datasets are carried out, and the results demonstrate that our approach is effective with different tasks, dataset sizes, and domain similarities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2021 workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[Deep Transfer Learning for Multi-source Entity Linkage via Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14509v1)** | 2021-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-source entity linkage focuses on integrating knowledge from multiple sources by linking the records that represent the same real world entity. This is critical in high-impact applications such as data cleaning and user stitching. The state-of-the-art entity linkage pipelines mainly depend on supervised learning that requires abundant amounts of training data. However, collecting well-labeled training data becomes expensive when the data from many sources arrives incrementally over time. Moreover, the trained models can easily overfit to specific data sources, and thus fail to generalize to new sources due to significant differences in data and label distributions. To address these challenges, we present AdaMEL, a deep transfer learning framework that learns generic high-level knowledge to perform multi-source entity linkage. AdaMEL models the attribute importance that is used to match entities through an attribute-level self-attention mechanism, and leverages the massive unlabeled data from new data sources through domain adaptation to make it generic and data-source agnostic. In addition, AdaMEL is capable of incorporating an additional set of labeled data to more accurately integrate data sources with different attribute importance. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results with 8.21% improvement on average over methods based on supervised learning. Besides, it is more stable in handling different sets of data sources in less runtime.</p></details> |  | None |

When the available labelled data is small, it is often beneficial to use transfer learning to leverage a related larger dataset (source) in order to improve the performance on the small dataset (target). Among the transfer learning approaches, domain adaptation methods assume that distributions between the two domains are shifted and attempt to realign them. In this paper, we consider the domain adaptation problem from the perspective of dimensionality reduction and propose a generic framework based on graph embedding. Instead of solving the generalised eigenvalue problem, we formulate the graph-preserving criterion as a loss in the neural network and learn a domain-invariant feature transformation in an end-to-end fashion. We show that the proposed approach leads to a powerful Domain Adaptation framework; a simple LDA-inspired instantiation of the framework leads to state-of-the-art performance on two of the most widely used Domain Adaptation benchmarks, Office31 and MNIST to USPS datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, in most problem areas there are insufficient annotated training samples. Therefore, the topic of transfer learning respectively domain adaptation is particularly important. In this work, we investigate to what extent unsupervised domain adaptation can be used for fine-grained recognition in a biodiversity context to learn a real-world classifier based on idealized training data, e.g. preserved butterflies and plants. Moreover, we investigate the influence of different normalization layers, such as Group Normalization in combination with Weight Standardization, on the classifier. We discovered that domain adaptation works very well for fine-grained recognition and that the normalization methods have a great influence on the results. Using domain adaptation and Transferable Normalization, the accuracy of the classifier could be increased by up to 12.35 % compared to the baseline. Furthermore, the domain adaptation system is combined with an active learning component to improve the results. We compare different active learning strategies with each other. Surprisingly, we found that more sophisticated strategies provide better results than the random selection baseline for only one of the two datasets. In this case, the distance and diversity strategy performed best. Finally, we present a problem analysis of the datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/clvision2021/call-for-papers/accepted-papers</p></details> | None |
| **[Self-Adaptive Partial Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08829v1)** | 2021-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Domain adaptation (PDA) aims to solve a more practical cross-domain learning problem that assumes target label space is a subset of source label space. However, the mismatched label space causes significant negative transfer. A traditional solution is using soft weights to increase weights of source shared domain and reduce those of source outlier domain. But it still learns features of outliers and leads to negative immigration. The other mainstream idea is to distinguish source domain into shared and outlier parts by hard binary weights, while it is unavailable to correct the tangled shared and outlier classes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Self-Adaptive Partial Domain Adaptation(SAPDA) Network. Class weights evaluation mechanism is introduced to dynamically self-rectify the weights of shared, outlier and confused classes, thus the higher confidence samples have the more sufficient weights. Meanwhile it can eliminate the negative transfer caused by the mismatching of label space greatly. Moreover, our strategy can efficiently measure the transferability of samples in a broader sense, so that our method can achieve competitive results on unsupervised DA task likewise. A large number of experiments on multiple benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our SAPDA.</p></details> | 10 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Domain Adaptation without Model Transferring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10174v4)** | 2021-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, researchers have been paying increasing attention to the threats brought by deep learning models to data security and privacy, especially in the field of domain adaptation. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods can achieve promising performance without transferring data from source domain to target domain. However, UDA with representation alignment or self-supervised pseudo-labeling relies on the transferred source models. In many data-critical scenarios, methods based on model transferring may suffer from membership inference attacks and expose private data. In this paper, we aim to overcome a challenging new setting where the source models cannot be transferred to the target domain. We propose Domain Adaptation without Source Model, which refines information from source model. In order to gain more informative results, we further propose Distributionally Adversarial Training (DAT) to align the distribution of source data with that of target data. Experimental results on benchmarks of Digit-Five, Office-Caltech, Office-31, Office-Home, and DomainNet demonstrate the feasibility of our method without model transferring.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Retinal Vessel Segmentation with Adversarial Learning and Transfer Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01821v1)** | 2021-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal vessel segmentation plays a key role in computer-aided screening, diagnosis, and treatment of various cardiovascular and ophthalmic diseases. Recently, deep learning-based retinal vessel segmentation algorithms have achieved remarkable performance. However, due to the domain shift problem, the performance of these algorithms often degrades when they are applied to new data that is different from the training data. Manually labeling new data for each test domain is often a time-consuming and laborious task. In this work, we explore unsupervised domain adaptation in retinal vessel segmentation by using entropy-based adversarial learning and transfer normalization layer to train a segmentation network, which generalizes well across domains and requires no annotation of the target domain. Specifically, first, an entropy-based adversarial learning strategy is developed to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains while also achieving the objective of entropy minimization on the target domain. In addition, a new transfer normalization layer is proposed to further boost the transferability of the deep network. It normalizes the features of each domain separately to compensate for the domain distribution gap. Besides, it also adaptively selects those feature channels that are more transferable between domains, thus further enhancing the generalization performance of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three regular fundus image datasets and an ultra-widefield fundus image dataset, and the results show that our approach yields significant performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Although various methods such as domain adaptation and domain generalization have evolved to combat this challenge, learning robust and generalizable representations is core to medical image understanding, and continues to be a problem. Here, we propose STRAP (Style TRansfer Augmentation for histoPathology), a form of data augmentation based on random style transfer from non-medical style source such as artistic paintings, for learning domain-agnostic visual representations in computational pathology. Style transfer replaces the low-level texture content of an image with the uninformative style of randomly selected style source image, while preserving the original high-level semantic content. This improves robustness to domain shift and can be used as a simple yet powerful tool for learning domain-agnostic representations. We demonstrate that STRAP leads to state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts, on two particular classification tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning transferable and discriminative features for unsupervised domain adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11723v2)** | 2021-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although achieving remarkable progress, it is very difficult to induce a supervised classifier without any labeled data. Unsupervised domain adaptation is able to overcome this challenge by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Transferability and discriminability are two key criteria for characterizing the superiority of feature representations to enable successful domain adaptation. In this paper, a novel method called \textit{learning TransFerable and Discriminative Features for unsupervised domain adaptation} (TFDF) is proposed to optimize these two objectives simultaneously. On the one hand, distribution alignment is performed to reduce domain discrepancy and learn more transferable representations. Instead of adopting \textit{Maximum Mean Discrepancy} (MMD) which only captures the first-order statistical information to measure distribution discrepancy, we adopt a recently proposed statistic called \textit{Maximum Mean and Covariance Discrepancy} (MMCD), which can not only capture the first-order statistical information but also capture the second-order statistical information in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). On the other hand, we propose to explore both local discriminative information via manifold regularization and global discriminative information via minimizing the proposed \textit{class confusion} objective to learn more discriminative features, respectively. We integrate these two objectives into the \textit{Structural Risk Minimization} (RSM) framework and learn a domain-invariant classifier. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five real-world datasets and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IDA journal</p></details> | None |

| **[Adapting Off-the-Shelf Source Segmenter for Target Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12497v1)** | 2021-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is usually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for segmentation, and propose to adapt an ``off-the-shelf" segmentation model pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g., self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods with the source data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in MICCAI 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09388v1)** | 2021-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a target task where labeled data is unavailable, domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain. Previous deep domain adaptation methods mainly learn a global domain shift, i.e., align the global source and target distributions without considering the relationships between two subdomains within the same category of different domains, leading to unsatisfying transfer learning performance without capturing the fine-grained information. Recently, more and more researchers pay attention to Subdomain Adaptation which focuses on accurately aligning the distributions of the relevant subdomains. However, most of them are adversarial methods which contain several loss functions and converge slowly. Based on this, we present Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) which learns a transfer network by aligning the relevant subdomain distributions of domain-specific layer activations across different domains based on a local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD). Our DSAN is very simple but effective which does not need adversarial training and converges fast. The adaptation can be achieved easily with most feed-forward network models by extending them with LMMD loss, which can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments demonstrate that DSAN can achieve remarkable results on both object recognition tasks and digit classification tasks.

Whilst Siamese-based trackers assume training and test data follow an identical distribution. Suppose there is a set of foggy or rainy test sequences, it cannot be guaranteed that the trackers trained on the normal images perform well on the data belonging to other domains. The problem of domain shift among training and test data has already been discussed in object detection and semantic segmentation areas, which, however, has not been investigated for visual tracking. To this end, based on SiamRPN++, we introduce a Domain Adaptive SiamRPN++, namely DASiamRPN++, to improve the cross-domain transferability and robustness of a tracker. Inspired by A-distance theory, we present two domain adaptive modules, Pixel Domain Adaptation (PDA) and Semantic Domain Adaptation (SDA). The PDA module aligns the feature maps of template and search region images to eliminate the pixel-level domain shift caused by weather, illumination, etc. The SDA module aligns the feature representations of the tracking target's appearance to eliminate the semantic-level domain shift. PDA and SDA modules reduce the domain disparity by learning domain classifiers in an adversarial training manner. The domain classifiers enforce the network to learn domain-invariant feature representations. Extensive experiments are performed on the standard datasets of two different domains, including synthetic foggy and TIR sequences, which demonstrate the transferability and domain adaptability of the proposed tracker.</p></details> | 10 pages,7 figures | None |
| **[Neural Supervised Domain Adaptation by Augmenting Pre-trained Models with Random Units](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04935v1)** | 2021-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Transfer Learning (TL) is becoming ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP), thanks to its high performance on many tasks, especially in low-resourced scenarios. Notably, TL is widely used for neural domain adaptation to transfer valuable knowledge from high-resource to low-resource domains. In the standard fine-tuning scheme of TL, a model is initially pre-trained on a source domain and subsequently fine-tuned on a target domain and, therefore, source and target domains are trained using the same architecture. In this paper, we show through interpretation methods that such scheme, despite its efficiency, is suffering from a main limitation. Indeed, although capable of adapting to new domains, pre-trained neurons struggle with learning certain patterns that are specific to the target domain. Moreover, we shed light on the hidden negative transfer occurring despite the high relatedness between source and target domains, which may mitigate the final gain brought by transfer learning. To address these problems, we propose to augment the pre-trained model with normalised, weighted and randomly initialised units that foster a better adaptation while maintaining the valuable source knowledge. We show that our approach exhibits significant improvements to the standard fine-tuning scheme for neural domain adaptation from the news domain to the social media domain on four NLP tasks: part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and morphosyntactic tagging.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, various deepfake generation techniques have emerged over the past few years. While many deepfake detection methods have been proposed, their performance suffers from new types of deepfake methods on which they are not sufficiently trained. To detect new types of deepfakes, the model should learn from additional data without losing its prior knowledge about deepfakes (catastrophic forgetting), especially when new deepfakes are significantly different. In this work, we employ the Representation Learning (ReL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigms to introduce a transfer learning-based Feature Representation Transfer Adaptation Learning (FReTAL) method. We use FReTAL to perform domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake datasets while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Our student model can quickly adapt to new types of deepfake by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model and applying transfer learning without using source domain data during domain adaptation. Through experiments on FaceForensics++ datasets, we demonstrate that FReTAL outperforms all baselines on the domain adaptation task with up to 86.97% accuracy on low-quality deepfakes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication at the Workshop on Media Forensics 2021</p></details> | None |

Policy transfer through warm initialization, imitation, or interacting over a large set of agents with randomized instances, have been commonly applied to solve a variety of Reinforcement Learning tasks. However, this seems far from how skill transfer happens in the biological world: Humans and animals are able to quickly adapt the learned behaviors between similar tasks and learn new skills when presented with new situations. Here we seek to answer the question: Will learning to combine adaptation and exploration lead to a more efficient transfer of policies between domains? We introduce a principled mechanism that can "Adapt-to-Learn", that is adapt the source policy to learn to solve a target task with significant transition differences and uncertainties. We show that the presented method learns to seamlessly combine learning from adaptation and exploration and leads to a robust policy transfer algorithm with significantly reduced sample complexity in transferring skills between related tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, TSS may not be readily available in up to 25% of patients with unwitnessed AIS. Current clinical guidelines for patients with unknown TSS recommend the use of MRI to determine eligibility for thrombolysis, but radiology assessments have high inter-reader variability. In this work, we present deep learning models that leverage MRI diffusion series to classify TSS based on clinically validated thresholds. We propose an intra-domain task-adaptive transfer learning method, which involves training a model on an easier clinical task (stroke detection) and then refining the model with different binary thresholds of TSS. We apply this approach to both 2D and 3D CNN architectures with our top model achieving an ROC-AUC value of 0.74, with a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.81 for classifying TSS < 4.5 hours. Our pretrained models achieve better classification metrics than the models trained from scratch, and these metrics exceed those of previously published models applied to our dataset. Furthermore, our pipeline accommodates a more inclusive patient cohort than previous work, as we did not exclude imaging studies based on clinical, demographic, or image processing criteria. When applied to this broad spectrum of patients, our deep learning model achieves an overall accuracy of 75.78% when classifying TSS < 4.5 hours, carrying potential therapeutic implications for patients with unknown TSS.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike the existing domain adaptation methods that learn associated features sharing a domain, DRANet preserves the distinctiveness of each domain's characteristics. Our model encodes individual representations of content (scene structure) and style (artistic appearance) from both source and target images. Then, it adapts the domain by incorporating the transferred style factor into the content factor along with learnable weights specified for each domain. This learning framework allows bi-/multi-directional domain adaptation with a single encoder-decoder network and aligns their domain shift. Additionally, we propose a content-adaptive domain transfer module that helps retain scene structure while transferring style. Extensive experiments show our model successfully separates content-style factors and synthesizes visually pleasing domain-transferred images.

However, such a static model is difficult to handle conflicts across multiple domains, and suffers from a performance degradation in both source domains and target domain. In this paper, we present dynamic transfer to address domain conflicts, where the model parameters are adapted to samples. The key insight is that adapting model across domains is achieved via adapting model across samples. Thus, it breaks down source domain barriers and turns multi-source domains into a single-source domain. This also simplifies the alignment between source and target domains, as it only requires the target domain to be aligned with any part of the union of source domains. Furthermore, we find dynamic transfer can be simply modeled by aggregating residual matrices and a static convolution matrix. Experimental results show that, without using domain labels, our dynamic transfer outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 3% on the large multi-source domain adaptation datasets -- DomainNet.

However, negative transfer may deteriorate the performance due to the feature distribution divergence between two datasets and task semantic difference in diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 that rely on different characteristics. It is even more challenging when the target dataset has no labels available, i.e., unsupervised task transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Task Adaptation Network (TAN) to solve this unsupervised task transfer problem. In addition to learning transferable features via domain-adversarial training, we propose a novel task semantic adaptor that uses the learning-to-learn strategy to adapt the task semantics. Experiments on three public COVID-19 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance. Especially on COVID-DA dataset, TAN significantly increases the recall and F1 score by 5.0% and 7.8% compared to recently strong baselines.

| **[Few-Shot Domain Adaptation for Grammatical Error Correction via Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12409v1)** | 2021-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) methods based on sequence-to-sequence mainly focus on how to generate more pseudo data to obtain better performance. Few work addresses few-shot GEC domain adaptation. In this paper, we treat different GEC domains as different GEC tasks and propose to extend meta-learning to few-shot GEC domain adaptation without using any pseudo data. We exploit a set of data-rich source domains to learn the initialization of model parameters that facilitates fast adaptation on new resource-poor target domains. We adapt GEC model to the first language (L1) of the second language learner. To evaluate the proposed method, we use nine L1s as source domains and five L1s as target domains. Experiment results on the L1 GEC domain adaptation dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the multi-task transfer learning baseline by 0.50 $F_{0.5}$ score on average and enables us to effectively adapt to a new L1 domain with only 200 parallel sentences.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-Teacher++: Exploiting Intra-domain and Inter-domain Knowledge with Reliable Transfer for Cardiac Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02375v1)** | 2021-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annotation scarcity is a long-standing problem in medical image analysis area. To efficiently leverage limited annotations, abundant unlabeled data are additionally exploited in semi-supervised learning, while well-established cross-modality data are investigated in domain adaptation. In this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of concurrently leveraging both unlabeled data and cross-modality data for annotation-efficient cardiac segmentation. To this end, we propose a cutting-edge semi-supervised domain adaptation framework, namely Dual-Teacher++. Besides directly learning from limited labeled target domain data (e.g., CT) via a student model adopted by previous literature, we design novel dual teacher models, including an inter-domain teacher model to explore cross-modality priors from source domain (e.g., MR) and an intra-domain teacher model to investigate the knowledge beneath unlabeled target domain. In this way, the dual teacher models would transfer acquired inter- and intra-domain knowledge to the student model for further integration and exploitation. Moreover, to encourage reliable dual-domain knowledge transfer, we enhance the inter-domain knowledge transfer on the samples with higher similarity to target domain after appearance alignment, and also strengthen intra-domain knowledge transfer of unlabeled target data with higher prediction confidence. In this way, the student model can obtain reliable dual-domain knowledge and yield improved performance on target domain data. We extensively evaluated the feasibility of our method on the MM-WHS 2017 challenge dataset. The experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our framework over other semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation methods. Moreover, our performance gains could be yielded in bidirections,i.e., adapting from MR to CT, and from CT to MR.</p></details> | Accepted by TMI | None |
| **[Hypothesis Disparity Regularized Mutual Information Maximization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08072v1)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a hypothesis disparity regularized mutual information maximization~(HDMI) approach to tackle unsupervised hypothesis transfer -- as an effort towards unifying hypothesis transfer learning (HTL) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) -- where the knowledge from a source domain is transferred solely through hypotheses and adapted to the target domain in an unsupervised manner. In contrast to the prevalent HTL and UDA approaches that typically use a single hypothesis, HDMI employs multiple hypotheses to leverage the underlying distributions of the source and target hypotheses. To better utilize the crucial relationship among different hypotheses -- as opposed to unconstrained optimization of each hypothesis independently -- while adapting to the unlabeled target domain through mutual information maximization, HDMI incorporates a hypothesis disparity regularization that coordinates the target hypotheses jointly learn better target representations while preserving more transferable source knowledge with better-calibrated prediction uncertainty. HDMI achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance on benchmark datasets for UDA in the context of HTL, without the need to access the source data during the adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2021</p></details> | None |

If domain invariant representations have dramatically improved the adaptability of models, to guarantee their good transferability remains a challenging problem. This paper addresses this problem by using active learning to annotate a small budget of target data. Although this setup, called Active Domain Adaptation (ADA), deviates from UDA's standard setup, a wide range of practical applications are faced with this situation. To this purpose, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Adversarial Gradient Embedding} (SAGE), a framework that makes a triple contribution to ADA. First, we select for annotation target samples that are likely to improve the representations' transferability by measuring the variation, before and after annotation, of the transferability loss gradient. Second, we increase sampling diversity by promoting different gradient directions. Third, we introduce a novel training procedure for actively incorporating target samples when learning invariant representations. SAGE is based on solid theoretical ground and validated on various UDA benchmarks against several baselines. Our empirical investigation demonstrates that SAGE takes the best of uncertainty \textit{vs} diversity samplings and improves representations transferability substantially.</p></details> |  | None |

However, because of the presence of domain shift, the learned knowledge of the well-trained DNNs cannot be well generalized to new domains or datasets that have few labels. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) studies the problem of transferring models trained on one labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. In this paper, we focus on UDA in visual emotion analysis for both emotion distribution learning and dominant emotion classification. Specifically, we design a novel end-to-end cycle-consistent adversarial model, termed CycleEmotionGAN++. First, we generate an adapted domain to align the source and target domains on the pixel-level by improving CycleGAN with a multi-scale structured cycle-consistency loss. During the image translation, we propose a dynamic emotional semantic consistency loss to preserve the emotion labels of the source images. Second, we train a transferable task classifier on the adapted domain with feature-level alignment between the adapted and target domains. We conduct extensive UDA experiments on the Flickr-LDL & Twitter-LDL datasets for distribution learning and ArtPhoto & FI datasets for emotion classification. The results demonstrate the significant improvements yielded by the proposed CycleEmotionGAN++ as compared to state-of-the-art UDA approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Our proposed approach, filtered manifold alignment (FMA), reduces the computational complexity of previous manifold alignment techniques, is flexible enough to align domains with completely disparate sets of feature and demonstrates state-of-the-art classification accuracy on multiple benchmark domain adaptation tasks composed of classifying real world image datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interventional Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03737v1)** | 2020-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer discriminative features learned from source domain to target domain. Most of DA methods focus on enhancing feature transferability through domain-invariance learning. However, source-learned discriminability itself might be tailored to be biased and unsafely transferable by spurious correlations, \emph{i.e.}, part of source-specific features are correlated with category labels. We find that standard domain-invariance learning suffers from such correlations and incorrectly transfers the source-specifics. To address this issue, we intervene in the learning of feature discriminability using unlabeled target data to guide it to get rid of the domain-specific part and be safely transferable. Concretely, we generate counterfactual features that distinguish the domain-specifics from domain-sharable part through a novel feature intervention strategy. To prevent the residence of domain-specifics, the feature discriminability is trained to be invariant to the mutations in the domain-specifics of counterfactual features. Experimenting on typical \emph{one-to-one} unsupervised domain adaptation and challenging domain-agnostic adaptation tasks, the consistent performance improvements of our method over state-of-the-art approaches validate that the learned discriminative features are more safely transferable and generalize well to novel domains.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the ability to perform few or zero-shot adaptation to novel tasks is important for the scalability and deployment of machine learning models. It is therefore crucial to understand what makes for good, transfer-able features in deep networks that best allow for such adaptation. In this paper, we shed light on this by showing that features that are most transferable have high uniformity in the embedding space and propose a uniformity regularization scheme that encourages better transfer and feature reuse. We evaluate the regularization on its ability to facilitate adaptation to unseen tasks and data, for which we conduct a thorough experimental study covering four relevant, and distinct domains: few-shot Meta-Learning, Deep Metric Learning, Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation, as well as Out-of-Distribution classification. Across all experiments, we show that uniformity regularization consistently offers benefits over baseline methods and is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Deep Metric Learning and Meta-Learning.</p></details> |  | None |

It is a problem characterized by large intra-class differences and subtle inter-class differences. In this paper, we tackle this problem in a weakly supervised manner, where neural network models are getting fed with additional data using a data augmentation technique through a visual attention mechanism. We perform domain adaptive knowledge transfer via fine-tuning on our base network model. We perform our experiment on six challenging and commonly used FGVC datasets, and we show competitive improvement on accuracies by using attention-aware data augmentation techniques with features derived from deep learning model InceptionV3, pre-trained on large scale datasets. Our method outperforms competitor methods on multiple FGVC datasets and showed competitive results on other datasets. Experimental studies show that transfer learning from large scale datasets can be utilized effectively with visual attention based data augmentation, which can obtain state-of-the-art results on several FGVC datasets. We present a comprehensive analysis of our experiments.

The application of transfer poses two serious challenges which have not been adequately addressed. First, the agent should be able to avoid negative transfer, which happens when the transfer hampers or slows down the learning instead of helping it. Second, the agent should be able to selectively transfer, which is the ability to select and transfer from different and multiple source tasks for different parts of the state space of the target task. We propose A2T (Attend, Adapt and Transfer), an attentive deep architecture which adapts and transfers from these source tasks. Our model is generic enough to effect transfer of either policies or value functions. Empirical evaluations on different learning algorithms show that A2T is an effective architecture for transfer by being able to avoid negative transfer while transferring selectively from multiple source tasks in the same domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017</p></details> | None |

A common approach to circumvent this is to leverage existing, similar data-sets with large amounts of labelled data. However, models trained on these canonical distributions do not readily transfer to real-world ones. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are often used to breach this "reality gap", though both require a substantial amount of real-world data. In this paper we discuss a more general approach: we propose learning a general transformation to bring arbitrary images towards a canonical distribution where we can naively apply the trained machine learning models. This transformation is trained in an unsupervised regime, leveraging data augmentation to generate off-canonical examples of images and training a Deep Learning model to recover their original counterpart. We quantify the performance of this transformation using pre-trained ImageNet classifiers, demonstrating that this procedure can recover half of the loss in performance on the distorted data-set. We then validate the effectiveness of this approach on a series of pre-trained ImageNet models on a real world data set collected by printing and photographing images in different lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning Target Domain Specific Classifier for Partial Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10785v1)** | 2020-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation~(UDA) aims at reducing the distribution discrepancy when transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous UDA methods assume that the source and target domains share an identical label space, which is unrealistic in practice since the label information of the target domain is agnostic. This paper focuses on a more realistic UDA scenario, i.e. partial domain adaptation (PDA), where the target label space is subsumed to the source label space. In the PDA scenario, the source outliers that are absent in the target domain may be wrongly matched to the target domain (technically named negative transfer), leading to performance degradation of UDA methods. This paper proposes a novel Target Domain Specific Classifier Learning-based Domain Adaptation (TSCDA) method. TSCDA presents a soft-weighed maximum mean discrepancy criterion to partially align feature distributions and alleviate negative transfer. Also, it learns a target-specific classifier for the target domain with pseudo-labels and multiple auxiliary classifiers, to further address classifier shift. A module named Peers Assisted Learning is used to minimize the prediction difference between multiple target-specific classifiers, which makes the classifiers more discriminant for the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on three PDA benchmark datasets show that TSCDA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with a large margin, e.g. $4\%$ and $5.6\%$ averagely on Office-31 and Office-Home, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Unsupervised domain adaptation is a promising avenue which transfers knowledge from a source domain to a target domain without using any labels in the target domain. Contemporary techniques focus on extracting domain-invariant features using domain adversarial training. However, these techniques neglect to learn discriminative class boundaries in the latent representation space on a target domain and yield limited adaptation performance. To address this problem, we propose distance metric guided feature alignment (MetFA) to extract discriminative as well as domain-invariant features on both source and target domains. The proposed MetFA method explicitly and directly learns the latent representation without using domain adversarial training. Our model integrates class distribution alignment to transfer semantic knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. We evaluate the proposed method on fetal ultrasound datasets for cross-device image classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art and enables model generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Balanced and Uncertainty-aware Approach for Partial Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02541v2)** | 2020-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, especially in the case of class labels in the target domain being only a subset of those in the source domain. Such a partial transfer setting is realistic but challenging and existing methods always suffer from two key problems, negative transfer and uncertainty propagation. In this paper, we build on domain adversarial learning and propose a novel domain adaptation method BA$^3$US with two new techniques termed Balanced Adversarial Alignment (BAA) and Adaptive Uncertainty Suppression (AUS), respectively. On one hand, negative transfer results in misclassification of target samples to the classes only present in the source domain. To address this issue, BAA pursues the balance between label distributions across domains in a fairly simple manner. Specifically, it randomly leverages a few source samples to augment the smaller target domain during domain alignment so that classes in different domains are symmetric. On the other hand, a source sample would be denoted as uncertain if there is an incorrect class that has a relatively high prediction score, and such uncertainty easily propagates to unlabeled target data around it during alignment, which severely deteriorates adaptation performance. Thus we present AUS that emphasizes uncertain samples and exploits an adaptive weighted complement entropy objective to encourage incorrect classes to have uniform and low prediction scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our BA$^3$US surpasses state-of-the-arts for partial domain adaptation tasks.

This problem is intrinsically difficult due to unpredictable changing nature of imagery data distributions in novel domains. Pre-learned knowledge does not transfer well without making strong assumptions about the learned and the novel domains. Different methods have been studied to address the underlying problem based on different assumptions, e.g. from domain adaptation to zero-shot and few-shot learning. In this work, we address this problem by transfer clustering that aims to learn a discriminative latent space of the unlabelled target data in a novel domain by knowledge transfer from labelled related domains. Specifically, we want to leverage relative (pairwise) imagery information, which is freely available and intrinsic to a target domain, to model the target domain image distribution characteristics as well as the prior-knowledge learned from related labelled domains to enable more discriminative clustering of unlabelled target data. Our method mitigates nontransferrable prior-knowledge by self-supervision, benefiting from both transfer and self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on four datasets for image clustering tasks reveal the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art transfer clustering techniques. We further demonstrate its competitive transferability on four zero-shot learning benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent techniques in domain adaptation and multi-domain learning enable the learning of more domain-agnostic features, their success relies on the presence of domain labels, typically requiring manual annotation and careful curation of datasets. Here we focus on a less explored, but more realistic case: learning from data from multiple domains, without access to domain annotations. In this scenario, standard model training leads to the overfitting of large domains, while disregarding smaller ones. We address this limitation via dynamic residual adapters, an adaptive gating mechanism that helps account for latent domains, coupled with an augmentation strategy inspired by recent style transfer techniques. Our proposed approach is examined on image classification tasks containing multiple latent domains, and we showcase its ability to obtain robust performance across these. Dynamic residual adapters significantly outperform off-the-shelf networks with much larger capacity, and can be incorporated seamlessly with existing architectures in an end-to-end manner.</p></details> |  | None |

Given that the annotation labelling requires medical expertise, such labels should be applied to as many learning tasks as possible. However, the multi-modal nature of each annotated image renders it difficult to share the annotation label among diverse tasks. In this work, we provide an inductive transfer learning (ITL) approach to adopt the annotation label of the source domain datasets to tasks of the target domain datasets using Cycle-GAN based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). To evaluate the applicability of the ITL approach, we adopted the brain tissue annotation label on the source domain dataset of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to the task of brain tumor segmentation on the target domain dataset of MRI. The results confirm that the segmentation accuracy of brain tumor segmentation improved significantly. The proposed ITL approach can make significant contribution to the field of medical image analysis, as we develop a fundamental tool to improve and promote various tasks using medical images.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, it assumes that only one unlabeled target sample can be available when learning to adapt. This setting is realistic but more challenging, in which conventional adaptation approaches are prone to failure due to the scarce of unlabeled target data. To this end, we propose a novel Adversarial Style Mining approach, which combines the style transfer module and task-specific module into an adversarial manner. Specifically, the style transfer module iteratively searches for harder stylized images around the one-shot target sample according to the current learning state, leading the task model to explore the potential styles that are difficult to solve in the almost unseen target domain, thus boosting the adaptation performance in a data-scarce scenario. The adversarial learning framework makes the style transfer module and task-specific module benefit each other during the competition. Extensive experiments on both cross-domain classification and segmentation benchmarks verify that ASM achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance under the challenging one-shot setting.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

Until very recently, existing adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) methods ignore the useful information from the label space, which is an important factor accountable for the complicated data distributions associated with different semantic classes. Especially, the inter-class semantic relationships have been rarely considered and discussed in the current work of transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a novel relationship-aware adversarial domain adaptation (RADA) algorithm, which first utilizes a single multi-class domain discriminator to enforce the learning of inter-class dependency structure during domain-adversarial training and then aligns this structure with the inter-class dependencies that are characterized from training the label predictor on source domain. Specifically, we impose a regularization term to penalize the structure discrepancy between the inter-class dependencies respectively estimated from domain discriminator and label predictor. Through this alignment, our proposed method makes the adversarial domain adaptation aware of the class relationships. Empirical studies show that the incorporation of class relationships significantly improves the performance on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

To do so, we introduce discrete disentangling representation and adversarial domain adaption into general domain transfer framework, aided by extra self-supervised modules including background and semantic consistency constraints, learning robust representation under dual domain constraints, such as feature and image domains. Experiments on synthetic and real noise removal tasks show the proposed method achieves comparable performance with other state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods, while having faster and stable convergence than other domain adaption methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, obtaining labels for some source domains may be very expensive, making complete labeling as used in prior work impractical. In this work, we investigate a new domain adaptation scenario with sparsely labeled source data, where only a few examples in the source domain have been labeled, while the target domain is unlabeled. We show that when labeled source examples are limited, existing methods often fail to learn discriminative features applicable for both source and target domains. We propose a novel Cross-Domain Self-supervised (CDS) learning approach for domain adaptation, which learns features that are not only domain-invariant but also class-discriminative. Our self-supervised learning method captures apparent visual similarity with in-domain self-supervision in a domain adaptive manner and performs cross-domain feature matching with across-domain self-supervision. In extensive experiments with three standard benchmark datasets, our method significantly boosts performance of target accuracy in the new target domain with few source labels and is even helpful on classical domain adaptation scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often align different domains in a single, global feature space (or view), which may fail to fully capture the richness of the languages used for expressing stances, leading to reduced adaptability on stance data. In this paper, we identify two major types of stance expressions that are linguistically distinct, and we propose a tailored dual-view adaptation network (DAN) to adapt these expressions across domains. The proposed model first learns a separate view for domain transfer in each expression channel and then selects the best adapted parts of both views for optimal transfer. We find that the learned view features can be more easily aligned and more stance-discriminative in either or both views, leading to more transferable overall features after combining the views. Results from extensive experiments show that our method can enhance the state-of-the-art single-view methods in matching stance data across different domains, and that it consistently improves those methods on various adaptation tasks.</p></details> | Accepted at ECAI2020 | None |

Partial domain adaptation (PDA) investigates the scenarios in which the source domain is large and diverse, and the target label space is a subset of the source label space. The main purpose of PDA is to identify the shared classes between the domains and promote learning transferable knowledge from these classes. In this paper, we propose a multi-class adversarial architecture for PDA. The proposed approach jointly aligns the marginal and class-conditional distributions in the shared label space by minimaxing a novel multi-class adversarial loss function. Furthermore, we incorporate effective regularization terms to encourage selecting the most relevant subset of source domain classes. In the absence of target labels, the proposed approach is able to effectively learn domain-invariant feature representations, which in turn can enhance the classification performance in the target domain. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets Office-31, Office-Home, and Caltech-Office corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing different partial transfer learning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Non-stationarity can be caused by either task drift, i.e., the drift in the conditional distribution of labels given the input data, or the domain drift, i.e., the drift in the marginal distribution of the input data. This paper aims to tackle this challenge in the context of continuous domain adaptation, where the model is required to learn new tasks adapted to new domains in a non-stationary environment while maintaining previously learned knowledge. To deal with both drifts, we propose variational domain-agnostic feature replay, an approach that is composed of three components: an inference module that filters the input data into domain-agnostic representations, a generative module that facilitates knowledge transfer, and a solver module that applies the filtered and transferable knowledge to solve the queries. We address the two fundamental scenarios in continuous domain adaptation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach for practical usage.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fisher Deep Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05636v1)** | 2020-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep domain adaptation models learn a neural network in an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the knowledge from a labeled source domain. This can be achieved by learning a domain-invariant feature space. Though the learned representations are separable in the source domain, they usually have a large variance and samples with different class labels tend to overlap in the target domain, which yields suboptimal adaptation performance. To fill the gap, a Fisher loss is proposed to learn discriminative representations which are within-class compact and between-class separable. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the Fisher loss is a general and effective loss for deep domain adaptation. Noticeable improvements are brought when it is used together with widely adopted transfer criteria, including MMD, CORAL and domain adversarial loss. For example, an absolute improvement of 6.67% in terms of the mean accuracy is attained when the Fisher loss is used together with the domain adversarial loss on the Office-Home dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Context-Aware Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04010v1)** | 2020-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in the semantic segmentation. There are two primary issues in this field, i.e., what and how to transfer domain knowledge across two domains. Existing methods mainly focus on adapting domain-invariant features (what to transfer) through adversarial learning (how to transfer). Context dependency is essential for semantic segmentation, however, its transferability is still not well understood. Furthermore, how to transfer contextual information across two domains remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we propose a cross-attention mechanism based on self-attention to capture context dependencies between two domains and adapt transferable context. To achieve this goal, we design two cross-domain attention modules to adapt context dependencies from both spatial and channel views. Specifically, the spatial attention module captures local feature dependencies between each position in the source and target image. The channel attention module models semantic dependencies between each pair of cross-domain channel maps. To adapt context dependencies, we further selectively aggregate the context information from two domains. The superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods is empirically proved on "GTA5 to Cityscapes" and "SYNTHIA to Cityscapes".</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Active Adversarial Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07848v2)** | 2020-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an active learning approach for transferring representations across domains. Our approach, active adversarial domain adaptation (AADA), explores a duality between two related problems: adversarial domain alignment and importance sampling for adapting models across domains. The former uses a domain discriminative model to align domains, while the latter utilizes it to weigh samples to account for distribution shifts. Specifically, our importance weight promotes samples with large uncertainty in classification and diversity from labeled examples, thus serves as a sample selection scheme for active learning. We show that these two views can be unified in one framework for domain adaptation and transfer learning when the source domain has many labeled examples while the target domain does not. AADA provides significant improvements over fine-tuning based approaches and other sampling methods when the two domains are closely related. Results on challenging domain adaptation tasks, e.g., object detection, demonstrate that the advantage over baseline approaches is retained even after hundreds of examples being actively annotated.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2020 Camera Ready Version</p></details> | None |
| **[Heterogeneous domain adaptation: An unsupervised approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02511v5)** | 2020-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation leverages the knowledge in one domain - the source domain - to improve learning efficiency in another domain - the target domain. Existing heterogeneous domain adaptation research is relatively well-progressed, but only in situations where the target domain contains at least a few labeled instances. In contrast, heterogeneous domain adaptation with an unlabeled target domain has not been well-studied. To contribute to the research in this emerging field, this paper presents: (1) an unsupervised knowledge transfer theorem that guarantees the correctness of transferring knowledge; and (2) a principal angle-based metric to measure the distance between two pairs of domains: one pair comprises the original source and target domains and the other pair comprises two homogeneous representations of two domains. The theorem and the metric have been implemented in an innovative transfer model, called a Grassmann-Linear monotonic maps-geodesic flow kernel (GLG), that is specifically designed for heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation (HeUDA). The linear monotonic maps meet the conditions of the theorem and are used to construct homogeneous representations of the heterogeneous domains. The metric shows the extent to which the homogeneous representations have preserved the information in the original source and target domains. By minimizing the proposed metric, the GLG model learns the homogeneous representations of heterogeneous domains and transfers knowledge through these learned representations via a geodesic flow kernel. To evaluate the model, five public datasets were reorganized into ten HeUDA tasks across three applications: cancer detection, credit assessment, and text classification. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model delivers superior performance over the existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems (TNNLS)</p></details> | None |

To address the problems of visual domain mismatch, we propose a novel semi-supervised adversarial transfer learning approach, which is called Coupled adversarial transfer Domain Adaptation (CatDA), for distribution alignment between two domains. The proposed CatDA approach is inspired by cycleGAN, but leveraging multiple shallow multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) instead of deep networks. Specifically, our CatDA comprises of two symmetric and slim sub-networks, such that the coupled adversarial learning framework is formulated. With such symmetry of two generators, the input data from source/target domain can be fed into the MLP network for target/source domain generation, supervised by two confrontation oriented coupled discriminators. Notably, in order to avoid the critical flaw of high-capacity of the feature extraction function during domain adversarial training, domain specific loss and domain knowledge fidelity loss are proposed in each generator, such that the effectiveness of the proposed transfer network is guaranteed. Additionally, the essential difference from cycleGAN is that our method aims to generate domain-agnostic and aligned features for domain adaptation and transfer learning rather than synthesize realistic images. We show experimentally on a number of benchmark datasets and the proposed approach achieves competitive performance over state-of-the-art domain adaptation and transfer learning approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it often suffers two major difficulties in practice: 1) only limited labeled samples are available due to expensive annotation costs over medical images; 2) labeled images may contain considerable label noises (e.g., mislabeling labels) due to diagnostic difficulties. In this paper, we seek to exploit rich labeled data from relevant domains to help the learning in the target task with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Unlike most existing UDA methods which rely on clean labeled data or assume samples are equally transferable, we propose a novel Collaborative Unsupervised Domain Adaptation algorithm to conduct transferability-aware domain adaptation and conquer label noise in a cooperative way.

Existing non-adversarial methods learn mappings between the source and target domains, to achieve reasonable performance. However, even these methods do not focus on a key aspect: maintaining performance on the source domain, even after optimizing over the target domain. Additionally, there exist very few methods in low resource supervised domain adaptation. This work proposes a method, LRS-DAG, that aims to solve these current issues in the field. By adding a set of "encoder layers" which map the target domain to the source, and can be removed when dealing directly with the source data, the model learns to perform optimally on both domains. LRS-DAG showcases its uniqueness by being a new algorithm for low resource domain adaptation which maintains performance over the source domain, with a new metric for learning mappings between domains being introduced. We show that, in the case of FCNs, when transferring from MNIST to SVHN, LRS-DAG performs comparably to fine tuning, with the advantage of maintaining performance over the source domain. LRS-DAG outperforms fine tuning when transferring to a synthetic dataset similar to MNIST, which is a setting more representative of low resource supervised domain adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Deep causal representation learning for unsupervised domain adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12417v1)** | 2019-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies show that the representations learned by deep neural networks can be transferred to similar prediction tasks in other domains for which we do not have enough labeled data. However, as we transition to higher layers in the model, the representations become more task-specific and less generalizable. Recent research on deep domain adaptation proposed to mitigate this problem by forcing the deep model to learn more transferable feature representations across domains. This is achieved by incorporating domain adaptation methods into deep learning pipeline. The majority of existing models learn the transferable feature representations which are highly correlated with the outcome. However, correlations are not always transferable. In this paper, we propose a novel deep causal representation learning framework for unsupervised domain adaptation, in which we propose to learn domain-invariant causal representations of the input from the source domain. We simulate a virtual target domain using reweighted samples from the source domain and estimate the causal effect of features on the outcomes. The extensive comparative study demonstrates the strengths of the proposed model for unsupervised domain adaptation via causal representations.</p></details> |  | None |

Our framework learns to transfer knowledge across tasks in a fully supervised domain (e.g., synthetic data) and use this knowledge on a different domain where we have only partial supervision (e.g., real data). Our proposal is complementary to existing domain adaptation techniques and extends them to cross tasks scenarios providing additional performance gains.

| **[Transfer Learning with Dynamic Distribution Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08531v1)** | 2019-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning aims to learn robust classifiers for the target domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain. Since the source and the target domains are usually from different distributions, existing methods mainly focus on adapting the cross-domain marginal or conditional distributions. However, in real applications, the marginal and conditional distributions usually have different contributions to the domain discrepancy. Existing methods fail to quantitatively evaluate the different importance of these two distributions, which will result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. In this paper, we propose a novel concept called Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (DDA), which is capable of quantitatively evaluating the relative importance of each distribution. DDA can be easily incorporated into the framework of structural risk minimization to solve transfer learning problems. On the basis of DDA, we propose two novel learning algorithms: (1) Manifold Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (MDDA) for traditional transfer learning, and (2) Dynamic Distribution Adaptation Network (DDAN) for deep transfer learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDDA and DDAN significantly improve the transfer learning performance and setup a strong baseline over the latest deep and adversarial methods on digits recognition, sentiment analysis, and image classification. More importantly, it is shown that marginal and conditional distributions have different contributions to the domain divergence, and our DDA is able to provide good quantitative evaluation of their relative importance which leads to better performance. We believe this observation can be helpful for future research in transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (ACM TIST) 2019, 25 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1807.07258</p></details> | None |
| **[Transfer Learning with Dynamic Adversarial Adaptation Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08184v1)** | 2019-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in deep transfer learning reveal that adversarial learning can be embedded into deep networks to learn more transferable features to reduce the distribution discrepancy between two domains. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods either learn a single domain discriminator to align the global source and target distributions or pay attention to align subdomains based on multiple discriminators. However, in real applications, the marginal (global) and conditional (local) distributions between domains are often contributing differently to the adaptation. There is currently no method to dynamically and quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of these two distributions for adversarial learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Adversarial Adaptation Network (DAAN) to dynamically learn domain-invariant representations while quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of global and local domain distributions. To the best of our knowledge, DAAN is the first attempt to perform dynamic adversarial distribution adaptation for deep adversarial learning. DAAN is extremely easy to implement and train in real applications. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of DAAN, and it can also be explained in an attention strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAAN achieves better classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art deep and adversarial methods. Results also imply the necessity and effectiveness of the dynamic distribution adaptation in adversarial transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICDM ...</summary><p>ICDM 2019 long paper (9.08% acceptance rate); 9 pages; code available at http://transferlearning.xyz</p></details> | None |

Most existing approaches independently address task-transferability and cross-domain adaptation, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose UM-Adapt - a unified framework to effectively perform unsupervised domain adaptation for spatially-structured prediction tasks, simultaneously maintaining a balanced performance across individual tasks in a multi-task setting. To realize this, we propose two novel regularization strategies; a) Contour-based content regularization (CCR) and b) exploitation of inter-task coherency using a cross-task distillation module. Furthermore, avoiding a conventional ad-hoc domain discriminator, we re-utilize the cross-task distillation loss as output of an energy function to adversarially minimize the input domain discrepancy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior generalizability of the learned representations simultaneously for multiple tasks under domain-shifts from synthetic to natural environments. UM-Adapt yields state-of-the-art transfer learning results on ImageNet classification and comparable performance on PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task, even with a smaller backbone-net. Moreover, the resulting semi-supervised framework outperforms the current fully-supervised multi-task learning state-of-the-art on both NYUD and Cityscapes dataset.</p></details> | ICCV 2019 (Oral) | None |
| **[Self-Training and Adversarial Background Regularization for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive One-Stage Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00597v1)** | 2019-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based object detectors have shown remarkable improvements. However, supervised learning-based methods perform poorly when the train data and the test data have different distributions. To address the issue, domain adaptation transfers knowledge from the label-sufficient domain (source domain) to the label-scarce domain (target domain). Self-training is one of the powerful ways to achieve domain adaptation since it helps class-wise domain adaptation. Unfortunately, a naive approach that utilizes pseudo-labels as ground-truth degenerates the performance due to incorrect pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce a weak self-training (WST) method and adversarial background score regularization (BSR) for domain adaptive one-stage object detection. WST diminishes the adverse effects of inaccurate pseudo-labels to stabilize the learning procedure. BSR helps the network extract discriminative features for target backgrounds to reduce the domain shift. Two components are complementary to each other as BSR enhances discrimination between foregrounds and backgrounds, whereas WST strengthen class-wise discrimination. Experimental results show that our approach effectively improves the performance of the one-stage object detection in unsupervised domain adaptation setting.</p></details> | ICCV 2019 (oral) | None |

In this paper, we propose a Soft Transfer Network (STN), which jointly learns a domain-shared classifier and a domain-invariant subspace in an end-to-end manner, for addressing the HDA problem. The proposed STN not only aligns the discriminative directions of domains but also matches both the marginal and conditional distributions across domains. To circumvent negative transfer, STN aligns the conditional distributions by using the soft-label strategy of unlabeled target data, which prevents the hard assignment of each unlabeled target data to only one category that may be incorrect. Further, STN introduces an adaptive coefficient to gradually increase the importance of the soft-labels since they will become more and more accurate as the number of iterations increases. We perform experiments on the transfer tasks of image-to-image, text-to-image, and text-to-text. Experimental results testify that the STN significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia (ACM MM) 2019</p></details> | None |

However, the current literature usually assumes to transfer the knowledge from the source domain to a specific known target domain. Domain Agnostic Learning (DAL) proposes a new task of transferring knowledge from the source domain to data from multiple heterogeneous target domains. In this work, we propose the Domain-Agnostic Learning framework with Anatomy-Consistent Embedding (DALACE) that works on both domain-transfer and task-transfer to learn a disentangled representation, aiming to not only be invariant to different modalities but also preserve anatomical structures for the DA and DAL tasks in cross-modality liver segmentation. We validated and compared our model with state-of-the-art methods, including CycleGAN, Task Driven Generative Adversarial Network (TD-GAN), and Domain Adaptation via Disentangled Representations (DADR). For the DA task, our DALACE model outperformed CycleGAN, TD-GAN ,and DADR with DSC of 0.847 compared to 0.721, 0.793 and 0.806. For the DAL task, our model improved the performance with DSC of 0.794 from 0.522, 0.719 and 0.742 by CycleGAN, TD-GAN, and DADR. Further, we visualized the success of disentanglement, which added human interpretability of the learned meaningful representations. Through ablation analysis, we specifically showed the concrete benefits of disentanglement for downstream tasks and the role of supervision for better disentangled representation with segmentation consistency to be invariant to domains with the proposed Domain-Agnostic Module (DAM) and to preserve anatomical information with the proposed Anatomy-Preserving Module (APM).</p></details> |  | None |

However, in the scenario where less data is available, these methods may yield poor performance. In this paper, we examine domain adaptation for text style transfer to leverage massively available data from other domains. These data may demonstrate domain shift, which impedes the benefits of utilizing such data for training. To address this challenge, we propose simple yet effective domain adaptive text style transfer models, enabling domain-adaptive information exchange. The proposed models presumably learn from the source domain to: (i) distinguish stylized information and generic content information; (ii) maximally preserve content information; and (iii) adaptively transfer the styles in a domain-aware manner.

However, as previous methods usually focus on learning embeddings for a single network, they can not learn representations transferable on multiple networks. Hence, it is important to design a network embedding algorithm that supports downstream model transferring on different networks, known as domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptive Network Embedding framework, which applies graph convolutional network to learn transferable embeddings. In DANE, nodes from multiple networks are encoded to vectors via a shared set of learnable parameters so that the vectors share an aligned embedding space. The distribution of embeddings on different networks are further aligned by adversarial learning regularization. In addition, DANE's advantage in learning transferable network embedding can be guaranteed theoretically.

The proposed ATL-DNN technique is tested for short-term wind power prediction, where continuously arriving information has to be exploited. Adaptive TL not only helps in providing good weight initialization, but is also helpful to utilize the incoming data for effective learning. Additionally, the proposed ATL-DNN technique is shown to transfer knowledge between different task domains (wind power to wind speed prediction) and from one region to another region.

In the previous studies, however, a major assumption accepted by default, is that the training and testing data are taking from same feature distribution. Unfortunately, this assumption is mostly invalid in real application, resulting in a certain lack of applicability for the traditional diagnosis approaches. Inspired by the idea of transfer learning that leverages the knowledge learnt from rich labeled data in source domain to facilitate diagnosing a new but similar target task, a new intelligent fault diagnosis framework, i.e., deep transfer network (DTN), which generalizes deep learning model to domain adaptation scenario, is proposed in this paper. By extending the marginal distribution adaptation (MDA) to joint distribution adaptation (JDA), the proposed framework can exploit the discrimination structures associated with the labeled data in source domain to adapt the conditional distribution of unlabeled target data, and thus guarantee a more accurate distribution matching. Extensive empirical evaluations on three fault datasets validate the applicability and practicability of DTN, while achieving many state-of-the-art transfer results in terms of diverse operating conditions, fault severities and fault types.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures | None |

Learning domain-invariant features helps to achieve this goal, whereas it underpins unlabeled samples drawn from a single or multiple explicit target domains (Multi-target DA). In this paper, we consider a more realistic transfer scenario: our target domain is comprised of multiple sub-targets implicitly blended with each other, so that learners could not identify which sub-target each unlabeled sample belongs to. This Blending-target Domain Adaptation (BTDA) scenario commonly appears in practice and threatens the validities of most existing DA algorithms, due to the presence of domain gaps and categorical misalignments among these hidden sub-targets. To reap the transfer performance gains in this new scenario, we propose Adversarial Meta-Adaptation Network (AMEAN). AMEAN entails two adversarial transfer learning processes. The first is a conventional adversarial transfer to bridge our source and mixed target domains. To circumvent the intra-target category misalignment, the second process presents as ``learning to adapt'': It deploys an unsupervised meta-learner receiving target data and their ongoing feature-learning feedbacks, to discover target clusters as our ``meta-sub-target'' domains. These meta-sub-targets auto-design our meta-sub-target DA loss, which empirically eliminates the implicit category mismatching in our mixed target. We evaluate AMEAN and a variety of DA algorithms in three benchmarks under the BTDA setup. Empirical results show that BTDA is a quite challenging transfer setup for most existing DA algorithms, yet AMEAN significantly outperforms these state-of-the-art baselines and effectively restrains the negative transfer effects in BTDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR-...</summary><p>CVPR-19 (oral).

The underlying idea of deep domain adaptation is to bridge the gap between source and target domains in a joint space so that a supervised classifier trained on labeled source data can be nicely transferred to the target domain. This idea is certainly intuitive and powerful, however, limited theoretical understandings have been developed to support its underpinning principle. In this paper, we have provided a rigorous framework to explain why it is possible to close the gap of the target and source domains in the joint space. More specifically, we first study the loss incurred when performing transfer learning from the source to the target domain. This provides a theory that explains and generalizes existing work in deep domain adaptation which was mainly empirical. This enables us to further explain why closing the gap in the joint space can directly minimize the loss incurred for transfer learning between the two domains. To our knowledge, this offers the first theoretical result that characterizes a direct bound on the joint space and the gain of transfer learning via deep domain adaptation</p></details> |  | None |

We propose to improve the discriminative ability of the target domain representation by simultaneously learning tightly clustered target representations while encouraging that each cluster is assigned to a unique and different class from the source. This strategy alleviates the effects of negative transfer when combined with adversarial domain matching between source and target representations. Our approach is robust to differences in the source and target label distributions and thus applicable to both balanced and imbalanced domain adaptation tasks, and with a simple extension, it can also be used for partial domain adaptation. Experiments on several benchmark datasets for domain adaptation demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance in all three scenarios, namely, balanced, imbalanced and partial domain adaptation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this more general and practical scenario, a major challenge is how to select source instances in the shared classes across different domains for positive transfer. To address this issue, we propose a Domain Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (DARL) framework to automatically select source instances in the shared classes for circumventing negative transfer as well as to simultaneously learn transferable features between domains by reducing the domain shift. Specifically, in this framework, we employ deep Q-learning to learn policies for an agent to make selection decisions by approximating the action-value function. Moreover, domain adversarial learning is introduced to learn domain-invariant features for the selected source instances by the agent and the target instances, and also to determine rewards for the agent based on how relevant the selected source instances are to the target domain. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the superior performance of our DARL method over existing state of the arts for partial domain adaptation.</p></details> |  | None |

With domain adversarial training, deep networks can learn disentangled and transferable features that effectively diminish the dataset shift between the source and target domains for knowledge transfer. In the era of Big Data, the ready availability of large-scale labeled datasets has stimulated wide interest in partial domain adaptation (PDA), which transfers a recognizer from a labeled large domain to an unlabeled small domain. It extends standard domain adaptation to the scenario where target labels are only a subset of source labels. Under the condition that target labels are unknown, the key challenge of PDA is how to transfer relevant examples in the shared classes to promote positive transfer, and ignore irrelevant ones in the specific classes to mitigate negative transfer. In this work, we propose a unified approach to PDA, Example Transfer Network (ETN), which jointly learns domain-invariant representations across the source and target domains, and a progressive weighting scheme that quantifies the transferability of source examples while controlling their importance to the learning task in the target domain. A thorough evaluation on several benchmark datasets shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for partial domain adaptation tasks.</p></details> | CVPR 2019 accepted | None |
| **[Manifold Criterion Guided Transfer Learning via Intermediate Domain Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10211v1)** | 2019-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many practical transfer learning scenarios, the feature distribution is different across the source and target domains (i.e. non-i.i.d.). Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), as a domain discrepancy metric, has achieved promising performance in unsupervised domain adaptation (DA). We argue that MMD-based DA methods ignore the data locality structure, which, to some extent, would cause the negative transfer effect. The locality plays an important role in minimizing the nonlinear local domain discrepancy underlying the marginal distributions. For better exploiting the domain locality, a novel local generative discrepancy metric (LGDM) based intermediate domain generation learning called Manifold Criterion guided Transfer Learning (MCTL) is proposed in this paper. The merits of the proposed MCTL are four-fold: 1) the concept of manifold criterion (MC) is first proposed as a measure validating the distribution matching across domains, and domain adaptation is achieved if the MC is satisfied; 2) the proposed MC can well guide the generation of the intermediate domain sharing similar distribution with the target domain, by minimizing the local domain discrepancy; 3) a global generative discrepancy metric (GGDM) is presented, such that both the global and local discrepancy can be effectively and positively reduced; 4) a simplified version of MCTL called MCTL-S is presented under a perfect domain generation assumption for more generic learning scenario. Experiments on a number of benchmark visual transfer tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed manifold criterion guided generative transfer method, by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.

Our transfer learning (TL) techniques enable to adapt the source model using the target data and new categories, without accessing to the source data. Our solution consists in adding new neurons in the output layer of the target model and transferring parameters from the source model, which are then fine-tuned with the target data. Additionally, we propose a neural adapter to learn the difference between the source and the target label distribution, which provides additional important information to the target model. Our experiments on Named Entity Recognition show that (i) the learned knowledge in the source model can be effectively transferred when the target data contains new categories and (ii) our neural adapter further improves such transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted paper in the Thirty-Third AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-19)</p></details> | None |

However, if the training data is not an unbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data is distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open questions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and domain-adaptive classifiers become practical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report. 41 pages, 5 figures</p></details> | None |

Aiming to solve an image classification task on a new domain that lacks labeled data but gains access to cheaply available unlabeled data, unsupervised domain adaptation is a promising technique to boost the performance without incurring extra labeling cost, by assuming images from different domains share some invariant characteristics. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation method named Domain-Adversarial Residual-Transfer (DART) learning of Deep Neural Networks to tackle cross-domain image classification tasks. In contrast to the existing unsupervised domain adaption approaches, the proposed DART not only learns domain-invariant features via adversarial training, but also achieves robust domain-adaptive classification via a residual-transfer strategy, all in an end-to-end training framework. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method for cross-domain image classification tasks on several well-known benchmark data sets, in which our method clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align different domains of multimodal distributions native in classification problems. In this paper, we present conditional adversarial domain adaptation, a principled framework that conditions the adversarial adaptation models on discriminative information conveyed in the classifier predictions. Conditional domain adversarial networks (CDANs) are designed with two novel conditioning strategies: multilinear conditioning that captures the cross-covariance between feature representations and classifier predictions to improve the discriminability, and entropy conditioning that controls the uncertainty of classifier predictions to guarantee the transferability. With theoretical guarantees and a few lines of codes, the approach has exceeded state-of-the-art results on five datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>32nd ...</summary><p>32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018), Montreal, Canada</p></details> | None |
| **[Domain Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning on the Atari](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07452v1)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning agents have recently been successful across a variety of discrete and continuous control tasks; however, they can be slow to train and require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn a suitable policy. This is borne out by the fact that a reinforcement learning agent has no prior knowledge of the world, no pre-existing data to depend on and so must devote considerable time to exploration. Transfer learning can alleviate some of the problems by leveraging learning done on some source task to help learning on some target task. Our work presents an algorithm for initialising the hidden feature representation of the target task. We propose a domain adaptation method to transfer state representations and demonstrate transfer across domains, tasks and action spaces. We utilise adversarial domain adaptation ideas combined with an adversarial autoencoder architecture. We align our new policies' representation space with a pre-trained source policy, taking target task data generated from a random policy. We demonstrate that this initialisation step provides significant improvement when learning a new reinforcement learning task, which highlights the wide applicability of adversarial adaptation methods; even as the task and label/action space also changes.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we study the efficacy of transfer learning by examining how the choice of data impacts performance. We find that more pre-training data does not always help, and transfer performance depends on a judicious choice of pre-training data. These findings are important given the continued increase in dataset sizes. We further propose domain adaptive transfer learning, a simple and effective pre-training method using importance weights computed based on the target dataset. Our method to compute importance weights follow from ideas in domain adaptation, and we show a novel application to transfer learning. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple fine-grained classification datasets and are well-suited for use in practice.</p></details> |  | None |

In addition, the identification of duplicate questions can reduce the resources required for retrieval, when the same questions are not repeated. This study compares the performance of deep neural networks and gradient tree boosting, and explores the possibility of domain adaptation with transfer learning to improve the under-performing target domains for the text-pair duplicates classification task, using three heterogeneous datasets: general-purpose Quora, technical Ask Ubuntu, and academic English Stack Exchange. Ultimately, our study exposes the alternative hypothesis that the meaning of a "duplicate" is not inherently general-purpose, but rather is dependent on the domain of learning, hence reducing the chance of transfer learning through adapting to the domain.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adapted Deep Embeddings: A Synthesis of Methods for $k$-Shot Inductive Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08402v4)** | 2018-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus in machine learning has branched beyond training classifiers on a single task to investigating how previously acquired knowledge in a source domain can be leveraged to facilitate learning in a related target domain, known as inductive transfer learning. Three active lines of research have independently explored transfer learning using neural networks. In weight transfer, a model trained on the source domain is used as an initialization point for a network to be trained on the target domain. In deep metric learning, the source domain is used to construct an embedding that captures class structure in both the source and target domains. In few-shot learning, the focus is on generalizing well in the target domain based on a limited number of labeled examples. We compare state-of-the-art methods from these three paradigms and also explore hybrid adapted-embedding methods that use limited target-domain data to fine tune embeddings constructed from source-domain data. We conduct a systematic comparison of methods in a variety of domains, varying the number of labeled instances available in the target domain ($k$), as well as the number of target-domain classes. We reach three principal conclusions: (1) Deep embeddings are far superior, compared to weight transfer, as a starting point for inter-domain transfer or model re-use (2) Our hybrid methods robustly outperform every few-shot learning and every deep metric learning method previously proposed, with a mean error reduction of 34% over state-of-the-art. (3) Among loss functions for discovering embeddings, the histogram loss (Ustinova & Lempitsky, 2016) is most robust. We hope our results will motivate a unification of research in weight transfer, deep metric learning, and few-shot learning.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we mainly focus on the tasks of parameter transfer under the framework of extreme learning machine (ELM). Unlike the existing parameter transfer approaches, which incorporate the source model information into the target by regularizing the di erence between the source and target domain parameters, an intuitively appealing projective-model is proposed to bridge the source and target model parameters. Specifically, we formulate the parameter transfer in the ELM networks by the means of parameter projection, and train the model by optimizing the projection matrix and classifier parameters jointly. Further more, the `L2,1-norm structured sparsity penalty is imposed on the source domain parameters, which encourages the joint feature selection and parameter transfer. To evaluate the e ectiveness of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments on several commonly used domain adaptation datasets are presented. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the non-transfer ELM networks and other classical transfer learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted as an oral paper by IJCNN 2018</p></details> | None |

To date, most of the existing works focus on the scenario of one source domain and one target domain (1S1T), and just a few works concern the scenario of multiple source domains and one target domain (mS1T). While, to the best of our knowledge, almost no work concerns the scenario of one source domain and multiple target domains (1SmT), in which these unlabeled target domains may not necessarily share the same categories, therefore, contrasting to mS1T, 1SmT is more challenging. Accordingly, for such a new UDA scenario, we propose a UDA framework through the model parameter adaptation (PA-1SmT). A key ingredient of PA-1SmT is to transfer knowledge through adaptive learning of a common model parameter dictionary, which is completely different from existing popular methods for UDA, such as subspace alignment, distribution matching etc., and can also be directly used for DA of privacy protection due to the fact that the knowledge is transferred just via the model parameters rather than data itself. Finally, our experimental results on three domain adaptation benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing domain adversarial networks generally assume identical label space across different domains. In the presence of big data, there is strong motivation of transferring deep models from existing big domains to unknown small domains. This paper introduces partial domain adaptation as a new domain adaptation scenario, which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption to that the source label space subsumes the target label space. Previous methods typically match the whole source domain to the target domain, which are vulnerable to negative transfer for the partial domain adaptation problem due to the large mismatch between label spaces. We present Partial Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PADA), which simultaneously alleviates negative transfer by down-weighing the data of outlier source classes for training both source classifier and domain adversary, and promotes positive transfer by matching the feature distributions in the shared label space. Experiments show that PADA exceeds state-of-the-art results for partial domain adaptation tasks on several datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, ECCV 2018 poster. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1707.07901</p></details> | None |

Most of the existing detection works rely on labor-intensive supervision, such as ground truth bounding boxes of objects or at least image-level annotations. On the contrary, we propose an object detection method that does not require any form of human annotation on target tasks, by exploiting freely available web images. In order to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from web images, we introduce a multi-instance multi-label domain adaption learning framework with two key innovations. First of all, we propose an instance-level adversarial domain adaptation network with attention on foreground objects to transfer the object appearances from web domain to target domain. Second, to preserve the class-specific semantic structure of transferred object features, we propose a simultaneous transfer mechanism to transfer the supervision across domains through pseudo strong label generation. With our end-to-end framework that simultaneously learns a weakly supervised detector and transfers knowledge across domains, we achieved significant improvements over baseline methods on the benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ECCV 2018</p></details> | None |
| **[Domain Adaptation Meets Disentangled Representation Learning and Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09025v4)** | 2018-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many methods have been proposed to solve the domain adaptation problem recently. However, the success of them implicitly funds on the assumption that the information of domains are fully transferrable. If the assumption is not satisfied, the effect of negative transfer may degrade domain adaptation. In this paper, a better learning network has been proposed by considering three tasks - domain adaptation, disentangled representation, and style transfer simultaneously. Firstly, the learned features are disentangled into common parts and specific parts. The common parts represent the transferrable features, which are suitable for domain adaptation with less negative transfer. Conversely, the specific parts characterize the unique style of each individual domain. Based on this, the new concept of feature exchange across domains, which can not only enhance the transferability of common features but also be useful for image style transfer, is introduced. These designs allow us to introduce five types of training objectives to realize the three challenging tasks at the same time. The experimental results show that our architecture can be adaptive well to full transfer learning and partial transfer learning upon a well-learned disentangled representation. Besides, the trained network also demonstrates high potential to generate style-transferred images.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, ACCV2018 submission</p></details> | None |
| **[Balanced Distribution Adaptation for Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00516v1)** | 2018-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning has achieved promising results by leveraging knowledge from the source domain to annotate the target domain which has few or none labels. Existing methods often seek to minimize the distribution divergence between domains, such as the marginal distribution, the conditional distribution or both. However, these two distances are often treated equally in existing algorithms, which will result in poor performance in real applications. Moreover, existing methods usually assume that the dataset is balanced, which also limits their performances on imbalanced tasks that are quite common in real problems. To tackle the distribution adaptation problem, in this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach, named as Balanced Distribution \underline{A}daptation~(BDA), which can adaptively leverage the importance of the marginal and conditional distribution discrepancies, and several existing methods can be treated as special cases of BDA. Based on BDA, we also propose a novel Weighted Balanced Distribution Adaptation~(W-BDA) algorithm to tackle the class imbalance issue in transfer learning. W-BDA not only considers the distribution adaptation between domains but also adaptively changes the weight of each class. To evaluate the proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on several transfer learning tasks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICDM 2017 | None |

We propose a Bayesian transfer learning framework where the source and target domains are related through the joint prior density of the model parameters. The modeling of joint prior densities enables better understanding of the "transferability" between domains. We define a joint Wishart density for the precision matrices of the Gaussian feature-label distributions in the source and target domains to act like a bridge that transfers the useful information of the source domain to help classification in the target domain by improving the target posteriors. Using several theorems in multivariate statistics, the posteriors and posterior predictive densities are derived in closed forms with hypergeometric functions of matrix argument, leading to our novel closed-form and fast Optimal Bayesian Transfer Learning (OBTL) classifier.

| **[Learning to cluster in order to transfer across domains and tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10125v3)** | 2018-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel method to perform transfer learning across domains and tasks, formulating it as a problem of learning to cluster. The key insight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity information and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and clustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer learning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints, which only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not. This similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source domain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for performing transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for unsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize classification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering network with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs. Second, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen categories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of semantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity network is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show that our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and unconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of the art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and ImageNet. Our results show that we can reconstruct semantic clusters with high accuracy. We then evaluate the performance of cross-domain transfer using images from the Office-31 and SVHN-MNIST tasks and present top accuracy on both datasets. Our approach doesn't explicitly deal with domain discrepancy. If we combine with a domain adaptation loss, it shows further improvement.</p></details> | ICLR 2018 | None |

However, training a deep neural network requires a large amount of labeled data, which is an expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise. Domain adaptation or transfer learning algorithms address this challenge by leveraging labeled data in a different, but related source domain, to develop a model for the target domain. Further, the explosive growth of digital data has posed a fundamental challenge concerning its storage and retrieval. Due to its storage and retrieval efficiency, recent years have witnessed a wide application of hashing in a variety of computer vision applications. In this paper, we first introduce a new dataset, Office-Home, to evaluate domain adaptation algorithms. The dataset contains images of a variety of everyday objects from multiple domains. We then propose a novel deep learning framework that can exploit labeled source data and unlabeled target data to learn informative hash codes, to accurately classify unseen target data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to exploit the feature learning capabilities of deep neural networks to learn representative hash codes to address the domain adaptation problem. Our extensive empirical studies on multiple transfer tasks corroborate the usefulness of the framework in learning efficient hash codes which outperform existing competitive baselines for unsupervised domain adaptation.</p></details> | CVPR 2017 | None |

Such knowledge is often incorporated through the availability of related data arising from domains and tasks similar to the one of current interest. Ideally one would like to allow both the data for the current task and for previous related tasks to self-organize the learning system in such a way that commonalities and differences between the tasks are learned in a data-driven fashion. We develop a framework for learning multiple tasks simultaneously, based on sharing features that are common to all tasks, achieved through the use of a modular deep feedforward neural network consisting of shared branches, dealing with the common features of all tasks, and private branches, learning the specific unique aspects of each task. Once an appropriate weight sharing architecture has been established, learning takes place through standard algorithms for feedforward networks, e.g., stochastic gradient descent and its variations. The method deals with domain adaptation and multi-task learning in a unified fashion, and can easily deal with data arising from different types of sources. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of learning in domain adaptation and transfer learning setups, and provide evidence for the flexible and task-oriented representations arising in the network.</p></details> |  | None |

Second, we try to address and analyze briefly the state-of-the-art methods for different types of scenarios, first describing the historical shallow methods, addressing both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous domain adaptation methods. Third, we discuss the effect of the success of deep convolutional architectures which led to new type of domain adaptation methods that integrate the adaptation within the deep architecture. Fourth, we overview the methods that go beyond image categorization, such as object detection or image segmentation, video analyses or learning visual attributes. Finally, we conclude the paper with a section where we relate domain adaptation to other machine learning solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Book ...</summary><p>Book chapter to appear in "Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision Applications", Springer Series: Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Edited by Gabriela Csurka</p></details> | None |
| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Residual Transfer Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04433v2)** | 2017-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of deep neural networks relies on massive amounts of labeled data. For a target task where labeled data is unavailable, domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain. In this paper, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep networks that can jointly learn adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. We relax a shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. We enable classifier adaptation by plugging several layers into deep network to explicitly learn the residual function with reference to the target classifier. We fuse features of multiple layers with tensor product and embed them into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to match distributions for feature adaptation. The adaptation can be achieved in most feed-forward models by extending them with new residual layers and loss functions, which can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Empirical evidence shows that the new approach outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>30th ...</summary><p>30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain</p></details> | None |
| **[Feature-Level Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04829v2)** | 2016-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation is the supervised learning setting in which the training and test data are sampled from different distributions: training data is sampled from a source domain, whilst test data is sampled from a target domain. This paper proposes and studies an approach, called feature-level domain adaptation (FLDA), that models the dependence between the two domains by means of a feature-level transfer model that is trained to describe the transfer from source to target domain. Subsequently, we train a domain-adapted classifier by minimizing the expected loss under the resulting transfer model. For linear classifiers and a large family of loss functions and transfer models, this expected loss can be computed or approximated analytically, and minimized efficiently. Our empirical evaluation of FLDA focuses on problems comprising binary and count data in which the transfer can be naturally modeled via a dropout distribution, which allows the classifier to adapt to differences in the marginal probability of features in the source and the target domain. Our experiments on several real-world problems show that FLDA performs on par with state-of-the-art domain-adaptation techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 13 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[A novel transfer learning method based on common space mapping and weighted domain matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04581v1)** | 2016-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework for the problem of domain transfer learning. We map the data of two domains to one single common space, and learn a classifier in this common space. Then we adapt the common classifier to the two domains by adding two adaptive functions to it respectively. In the common space, the target domain data points are weighted and matched to the target domain in term of distributions. The weighting terms of source domain data points and the target domain classification responses are also regularized by the local reconstruction coefficients. The novel transfer learning framework is evaluated over some benchmark cross-domain data sets, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1605.06673</p></details> | None |
| **[Domain Transfer Multi-Instance Dictionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08397v1)** | 2016-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we invest the domain transfer learning problem with multi-instance data. We assume we already have a well-trained multi-instance dictionary and its corresponding classifier from the source domain, which can be used to represent and classify the bags. But it cannot be directly used to the target domain. Thus we propose to adapt them to the target domain by adding an adaptive term to the source domain classifier. The adaptive function is a linear function based a domain transfer multi-instance dictionary. Given a target domain bag, we first map it to a bag-level feature space using the domain transfer dictionary, and then apply a the linear adaptive function to its bag-level feature vector. To learn the domain-transfer dictionary and the adaptive function parameter, we simultaneously minimize the average classification error of the target domain classifier over the target domain training set, and the complexities of both the adaptive function parameter and the domain transfer dictionary. The minimization problem is solved by an iterative algorithm which update the dictionary and the function parameter alternately. Experiments over several benchmark data sets show the advantage of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art domain transfer multi-instance learning methods.</p></details> |  | None |
