| **[Explainable, Domain-Adaptive, and Federated Artificial Intelligence in Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09317v1)** | 2022-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform data analysis in many domains. Progress in each domain is driven by a growing body of annotated data, increased computational resources, and technological innovations. In medicine, the sensitivity of the data, the complexity of the tasks, the potentially high stakes, and a requirement of accountability give rise to a particular set of challenges. In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. (1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. (2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. (3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted in IEEE CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, Nov. 10 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[Domain Generalization: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02503v7)** | 2022-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a capability natural to humans yet challenging for machines to reproduce. This is because most learning algorithms strongly rely on the i.i.d.~assumption on source/target data, which is often violated in practice due to domain shift. Domain generalization (DG) aims to achieve OOD generalization by using only source data for model learning. Over the last ten years, research in DG has made great progress, leading to a broad spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment, meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, to name a few; DG has also been studied in various application areas including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, medical imaging, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, for the first time a comprehensive literature review in DG is provided to summarize the developments over the past decade. Specifically, we first cover the background by formally defining DG and relating it to other relevant fields like domain adaptation and transfer learning. Then, we conduct a thorough review into existing methods and theories. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[A general approach to bridge the reality-gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01865v1)** | 2020-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Employing machine learning models in the real world requires collecting large amounts of data, which is both time consuming and costly to collect. A common approach to circumvent this is to leverage existing, similar data-sets with large amounts of labelled data. However, models trained on these canonical distributions do not readily transfer to real-world ones. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are often used to breach this "reality gap", though both require a substantial amount of real-world data. In this paper we discuss a more general approach: we propose learning a general transformation to bring arbitrary images towards a canonical distribution where we can naively apply the trained machine learning models. This transformation is trained in an unsupervised regime, leveraging data augmentation to generate off-canonical examples of images and training a Deep Learning model to recover their original counterpart. We quantify the performance of this transformation using pre-trained ImageNet classifiers, demonstrating that this procedure can recover half of the loss in performance on the distorted data-set. We then validate the effectiveness of this approach on a series of pre-trained ImageNet models on a real world data set collected by printing and photographing images in different lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Active Adversarial Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07848v2)** | 2020-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an active learning approach for transferring representations across domains. Our approach, active adversarial domain adaptation (AADA), explores a duality between two related problems: adversarial domain alignment and importance sampling for adapting models across domains. The former uses a domain discriminative model to align domains, while the latter utilizes it to weigh samples to account for distribution shifts. Specifically, our importance weight promotes samples with large uncertainty in classification and diversity from labeled examples, thus serves as a sample selection scheme for active learning. We show that these two views can be unified in one framework for domain adaptation and transfer learning when the source domain has many labeled examples while the target domain does not. AADA provides significant improvements over fine-tuning based approaches and other sampling methods when the two domains are closely related. Results on challenging domain adaptation tasks, e.g., object detection, demonstrate that the advantage over baseline approaches is retained even after hundreds of examples being actively annotated.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2020 Camera Ready Version</p></details> | None |
| **[Adversarial Transfer Learning for Cross-domain Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08904v2)** | 2019-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many practical visual recognition scenarios, feature distribution in the source domain is generally different from that of the target domain, which results in the emergence of general cross-domain visual recognition problems. To address the problems of visual domain mismatch, we propose a novel semi-supervised adversarial transfer learning approach, which is called Coupled adversarial transfer Domain Adaptation (CatDA), for distribution alignment between two domains. The proposed CatDA approach is inspired by cycleGAN, but leveraging multiple shallow multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) instead of deep networks. Specifically, our CatDA comprises of two symmetric and slim sub-networks, such that the coupled adversarial learning framework is formulated. With such symmetry of two generators, the input data from source/target domain can be fed into the MLP network for target/source domain generation, supervised by two confrontation oriented coupled discriminators. Notably, in order to avoid the critical flaw of high-capacity of the feature extraction function during domain adversarial training, domain specific loss and domain knowledge fidelity loss are proposed in each generator, such that the effectiveness of the proposed transfer network is guaranteed. Additionally, the essential difference from cycleGAN is that our method aims to generate domain-agnostic and aligned features for domain adaptation and transfer learning rather than synthesize realistic images. We show experimentally on a number of benchmark datasets and the proposed approach achieves competitive performance over state-of-the-art domain adaptation and transfer learning approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An introduction to domain adaptation and transfer learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11806v2)** | 2019-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In machine learning, if the training data is an unbiased sample of an underlying distribution, then the learned classification function will make accurate predictions for new samples. However, if the training data is not an unbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data is distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open questions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and domain-adaptive classifiers become practical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report. 41 pages, 5 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Joint auto-encoders: a flexible multi-task learning framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10494v1)** | 2017-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The incorporation of prior knowledge into learning is essential in achieving good performance based on small noisy samples. Such knowledge is often incorporated through the availability of related data arising from domains and tasks similar to the one of current interest. Ideally one would like to allow both the data for the current task and for previous related tasks to self-organize the learning system in such a way that commonalities and differences between the tasks are learned in a data-driven fashion. We develop a framework for learning multiple tasks simultaneously, based on sharing features that are common to all tasks, achieved through the use of a modular deep feedforward neural network consisting of shared branches, dealing with the common features of all tasks, and private branches, learning the specific unique aspects of each task. Once an appropriate weight sharing architecture has been established, learning takes place through standard algorithms for feedforward networks, e.g., stochastic gradient descent and its variations. The method deals with domain adaptation and multi-task learning in a unified fashion, and can easily deal with data arising from different types of sources. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of learning in domain adaptation and transfer learning setups, and provide evidence for the flexible and task-oriented representations arising in the network.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Domain Adaptation for Visual Applications: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05374v2)** | 2017-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to give an overview of domain adaptation and transfer learning with a specific view on visual applications. After a general motivation, we first position domain adaptation in the larger transfer learning problem. Second, we try to address and analyze briefly the state-of-the-art methods for different types of scenarios, first describing the historical shallow methods, addressing both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous domain adaptation methods. Third, we discuss the effect of the success of deep convolutional architectures which led to new type of domain adaptation methods that integrate the adaptation within the deep architecture. Fourth, we overview the methods that go beyond image categorization, such as object detection or image segmentation, video analyses or learning visual attributes. Finally, we conclude the paper with a section where we relate domain adaptation to other machine learning solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Book ...</summary><p>Book chapter to appear in "Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision Applications", Springer Series: Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Edited by Gabriela Csurka</p></details> | None |
| **[Domain Adaptation and Transfer Learning in StochasticNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05844v1)** | 2015-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning is a recent field of machine learning research that aims to resolve the challenge of dealing with insufficient training data in the domain of interest. This is a particular issue with traditional deep neural networks where a large amount of training data is needed. Recently, StochasticNets was proposed to take advantage of sparse connectivity in order to decrease the number of parameters that needs to be learned, which in turn may relax training data size requirements. In this paper, we study the efficacy of transfer learning on StochasticNet frameworks. Experimental results show ~7% improvement on StochasticNet performance when the transfer learning is applied in training step.</p></details> |  | None |
