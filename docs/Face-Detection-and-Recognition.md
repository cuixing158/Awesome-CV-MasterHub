| **[Facial Expression Recognition System Using DNN Accelerator with Multi-threading on FPGA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02408v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we implement a stand-alone facial expression recognition system on an SoC FPGA with multi-threading using a Deep learning Processor Unit (DPU). The system consists of two steps: one for face detection step and one for facial expression recognition. In the previous work, the Haar Cascade detector was run on a CPU in the face detection step due to FPGA resource limitations, but this detector is less accurate for profile and variable illumination condition images. Moreover, the previous work used a dedicated circuit accelerator, so running a second DNN inference for face detection on the FPGA would require the addition of a new accelerator. As an alternative to this approach, we run the two inferences by DNN on a DPU, which is a general-purpose CNN accelerator of the systolic array type. Our method for face detection using DenseBox and facial expression recognition using CNN on the same DPU enables the efficient use of FPGA resources while maintaining a small circuit size. We also developed a multi-threading technique that improves the overall throughput while increasing the DPU utilization efficiency. With this approach, we achieved an overall system throughput of 25 FPS and a throughput per power consumption of 2.4 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was published in the proceedings of the 2024 Twelfth International Symposium on Computing and Networking Workshops (CANDARW)</p></details> | None |
| **[Optimizing DINOv2 with Registers for Face Anti-Spoofing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17201v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user, potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop: Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Workshop FAS</p></details> | None |
| **[Backdoor Poisoning Attack Against Face Spoofing Attack Detection Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03108v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise, and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image without inducing any perceptible visual alterations. Through experiments conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)</p></details> | None |
| **[Two-Factor Authentication Smart Entryway Using Modified LBPH Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13617v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for future use in the user acceptance test.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MADPromptS: Unlocking Zero-Shot Morphing Attack Detection with Multiple Prompt Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08939v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image, resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Multimedia Workshops</p></details> | None |
| **[From Detection to Correction: Backdoor-Resilient Face Recognition via Vision-Language Trigger Detection and Noise-Based Neutralization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05409v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric: Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate, and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition systems.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 24 Figures | None |
| **[Backdoor Attacks on Deep Learning Face Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00620v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment. This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Deepfake Detection for Electronic Know Your Customer Systems Using Registered Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22601v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various forms of unseen image degradation.

| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for the Study of the Effects of Facial Filters on Face Recognition Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17729v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial filters are now commonplace for social media users around the world. Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve face recognition performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[In-context Learning of Vision Language Models for Detection of Physical and Digital Attacks against Face Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15285v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges, including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving generalisation in attack detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE-TIFS</p></details> | None |
| **[Unified Face Matching and Physical-Digital Spoofing Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09635v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition technology has dramatically transformed the landscape of security, surveillance, and authentication systems, offering a user-friendly and non-invasive biometric solution. However, despite its significant advantages, face recognition systems face increasing threats from physical and digital spoofing attacks. Current research typically treats face recognition and attack detection as distinct classification challenges. This approach necessitates the implementation of separate models for each task, leading to considerable computational complexity, particularly on devices with limited resources. Such inefficiencies can stifle scalability and hinder performance. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative unified model designed for face recognition and detection of physical and digital attacks. By leveraging the advanced Swin Transformer backbone and incorporating HiLo attention in a convolutional neural network framework, we address unified face recognition and spoof attack detection more effectively. Moreover, we introduce augmentation techniques that replicate the traits of physical and digital spoofing cues, significantly enhancing our model robustness. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation across various datasets, we showcase the effectiveness of our model in unified face recognition and spoof detection. Additionally, we confirm its resilience against unseen physical and digital spoofing attacks, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Autonomous AI Surveillance: Multimodal Deep Learning for Cognitive and Behavioral Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01590v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel classroom surveillance system that integrates multiple modalities, including drowsiness, tracking of mobile phone usage, and face recognition,to assess student attentiveness with enhanced precision.The system leverages the YOLOv8 model to detect both mobile phone and sleep usage,(Ghatge et al., 2024) while facial recognition is achieved through LResNet Occ FC body tracking using YOLO and MTCNN.(Durai et al., 2024) These models work in synergy to provide comprehensive, real-time monitoring, offering insights into student engagement and behavior.(S et al., 2023) The framework is trained on specialized datasets, such as the RMFD dataset for face recognition and a Roboflow dataset for mobile phone detection. The extensive evaluation of the system shows promising results. Sleep detection achieves 97. 42% mAP@50, face recognition achieves 86. 45% validation accuracy and mobile phone detection reach 85. 89% mAP@50. The system is implemented within a core PHP web application and utilizes ESP32-CAM hardware for seamless data capture.(Neto et al., 2024) This integrated approach not only enhances classroom monitoring, but also ensures automatic attendance recording via face recognition as students remain seated in the classroom, offering scalability for diverse educational environments.(Banada,2025)</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On the Burstiness of Faces in Set](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20312v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition (SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects: Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling (GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Leveraging Intermediate Features of Vision Transformer for Face Anti-Spoofing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24402v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against changes in head pose, illumination, and blurring during image capture. If a malicious person presents a face photo of the registered user, they may bypass the authentication process illegally. Such spoofing attacks need to be detected before face recognition. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack detection method based on Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect minute differences between live and spoofed face images. The proposed method utilizes the intermediate features of ViT, which have a good balance between local and global features that are important for spoofing attack detection, for calculating loss in training and score in inference. The proposed method also introduces two data augmentation methods: face anti-spoofing data augmentation and patch-wise data augmentation, to improve the accuracy of spoofing attack detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments using the OULU-NPU and SiW datasets.

| **[FANVID: A Benchmark for Face and License Plate Recognition in Low-Resolution Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07304v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63 identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and labels. FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition -- extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and character-level accuracy for text. A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks. FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Biometric Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24214v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of foundation models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has redefined the frontiers of artificial intelligence, enabling remarkable generalization across diverse tasks with minimal or no supervision. Yet, their potential in biometric recognition and analysis remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the zero-shot and few-shot performance of state-of-the-art publicly available VLMs and MLLMs across six biometric tasks spanning the face and iris modalities: face verification, soft biometric attribute prediction (gender and race), iris recognition, presentation attack detection (PAD), and face manipulation detection (morphs and deepfakes). A total of 41 VLMs were used in this evaluation. Experiments show that embeddings from these foundation models can be used for diverse biometric tasks with varying degrees of success. For example, in the case of face verification, a True Match Rate (TMR) of 96.77 percent was obtained at a False Match Rate (FMR) of 1 percent on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) dataset, without any fine-tuning. In the case of iris recognition, the TMR at 1 percent FMR on the IITD-R-Full dataset was 97.55 percent without any fine-tuning. Further, we show that applying a simple classifier head to these embeddings can help perform DeepFake detection for faces, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for irides, and extract soft biometric attributes like gender and ethnicity from faces with reasonably high accuracy. This work reiterates the potential of pretrained models in achieving the long-term vision of Artificial General Intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transforming faces into video stories -- VideoFace2.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02060v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face detection and face recognition have been in the focus of vision community since the very beginnings. Inspired by the success of the original Videoface digitizer, a pioneering device that allowed users to capture video signals from any source, we have designed an advanced video analytics tool to efficiently create structured video stories, i.e. identity-based information catalogs. VideoFace2.0 is the name of the developed system for spatial and temporal localization of each unique face in the input video, i.e. face re-identification (ReID), which also allows their cataloging, characterization and creation of structured video outputs for later downstream tasks. Developed near real-time solution is primarily designed to be utilized in application scenarios involving TV production, media analysis, and as an efficient tool for creating large video datasets necessary for training machine learning (ML) models in challenging vision tasks such as lip reading and multimodal speech recognition. Conducted experiments confirm applicability of the proposed face ReID algorithm that is combining the concepts of face detection, face recognition and passive tracking-by-detection in order to achieve robust and efficient face ReID. The system is envisioned as a compact and modular extensions of the existing video production equipment. Presented results are based on test implementation that achieves between 18-25 fps on consumer type notebook. Ablation experiments also confirmed that the proposed algorithm brings relative gain in the reduction of number of false identities in the range of 73%-93%. We hope that the presented work and shared code implementation will stimulate further interest in development of similar, application specific video analysis tools, and lower the entry barrier for production of high-quality multi-modal datasets in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 Pag...</summary><p>4 Pages, 2 Figures, 1 Table, 1 Algorithm; Associated VideoFace2.0 code, test videos and results visualizations are available at https://github.com/brkljac/VideoFace2.0 ; Preprint accepted for publication at the 14th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO), 10-14 June 2025, Budva, Montenegro</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/brkljac/VideoFace2.0) |
| **[Edge-GPU Based Face Tracking for Face Detection and Recognition Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04524v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cost-effective machine vision systems dedicated to real-time and accurate face detection and recognition in public places are crucial for many modern applications. However, despite their high performance, which could be reached using specialized edge or cloud AI hardware accelerators, there is still room for improvement in throughput and power consumption. This paper aims to suggest a combined hardware-software approach that optimizes face detection and recognition systems on one of the latest edge GPUs, namely NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. First, it leverages the simultaneous usage of all its hardware engines to improve processing time. This offers an improvement over previous works where these tasks were mainly allocated automatically and exclusively to the CPU or, to a higher extent, to the GPU core. Additionally, the paper suggests integrating a face tracker module to avoid redundantly running the face recognition algorithm for every frame but only when a new face appears in the scene. The results of extended experiments suggest that simultaneous usage of all the hardware engines that are available in the Orin GPU and tracker integration into the pipeline yield an impressive throughput of 290 FPS (frames per second) on 1920 x 1080 input size frames containing in average of 6 faces/frame. Additionally, a substantial saving of power consumption of around 800 mW was achieved when compared to running the task on the CPU/GPU engines only and without integrating a tracker into the Orin GPU\'92s pipeline. This hardware-codesign approach can pave the way to design high-performance machine vision systems at the edge, critically needed in video monitoring in public places where several nearby cameras are usually deployed for a same scene.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Leveraging Simultaneous Usage of Edge GPU Hardware Engines for Video Face Detection and Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04502v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video face detection and recognition in public places at the edge is required in several applications, such as security reinforcement and contactless access to authorized venues. This paper aims to maximize the simultaneous usage of hardware engines available in edge GPUs nowadays by leveraging the concurrency and pipelining of tasks required for face detection and recognition. This also includes the video decoding task, which is required in most face monitoring applications as the video streams are usually carried via Gbps Ethernet network. This constitutes an improvement over previous works where the tasks are usually allocated to a single engine due to the lack of a unified and automated framework that simultaneously explores all hardware engines. In addition, previously, the input faces were usually embedded in still images or within raw video streams that overlook the burst delay caused by the decoding stage. The results on real-life video streams suggest that simultaneously using all the hardware engines available in the recent NVIDIA edge Orin GPU, higher throughput, and a slight saving of power consumption of around 300 mW, accounting for around 5%, have been achieved while satisfying the real-time performance constraint. The performance gets even higher by considering several video streams simultaneously. Further performance improvement could have been obtained if the number of shuffle layers that were created by the tensor RT framework for the face recognition task was lower. Thus, the paper suggests some hardware improvements to the existing edge GPU processors to enhance their performance even higher.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures | None |

We propose Face-LLaVA, a multimodal large language model for face-centered, in-context learning, including facial expression and attribute recognition. Additionally, Face-LLaVA is able to generate natural language descriptions that can be used for reasoning. Leveraging existing visual databases, we first developed FaceInstruct-1M, a face-centered database for instruction tuning MLLMs for face processing. We then developed a novel face-specific visual encoder powered by Face-Region Guided Cross-Attention that integrates face geometry with local visual features. We evaluated the proposed method across nine different datasets and five different face processing tasks, including facial expression recognition, action unit detection, facial attribute detection, age estimation and deepfake detection. Face-LLaVA achieves superior results compared to existing open-source MLLMs and competitive performance compared to commercial solutions. Our model output also receives a higher reasoning rating by GPT under a zero-shot setting across all the tasks.

To solve the lack of large-scale and public-available datasets due to privacy concerns and restrictions, in this work we propose a new method to generate a synthetic face morphing dataset with 2450 identities and more than 100k morphs. The proposed synthetic face morphing dataset is unique for its high-quality samples, different types of morphing algorithms, and the generalization for both single and differential morphing attack detection algorithms. For experiments, we apply face image quality assessment and vulnerability analysis to evaluate the proposed synthetic face morphing dataset from the perspective of biometric sample quality and morphing attack potential on face recognition systems. The results are benchmarked with an existing SOTA synthetic dataset and a representative non-synthetic and indicate improvement compared with the SOTA. Additionally, we design different protocols and study the applicability of using the proposed synthetic dataset on training morphing attack detection algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been further published in IEEE Access.

| **[FairDeFace: Evaluating the Fairness and Adversarial Robustness of Face Obfuscation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08731v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lack of a common platform and benchmark datasets for evaluating face obfuscation methods has been a challenge, with every method being tested using arbitrary experiments, datasets, and metrics. While prior work has demonstrated that face recognition systems exhibit bias against some demographic groups, there exists a substantial gap in our understanding regarding the fairness of face obfuscation methods. Providing fair face obfuscation methods can ensure equitable protection across diverse demographic groups, especially since they can be used to preserve the privacy of vulnerable populations. To address these gaps, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework, named FairDeFace, designed to assess the adversarial robustness and fairness of face obfuscation methods. The framework introduces a set of modules encompassing data benchmarks, face detection and recognition algorithms, adversarial models, utility detection models, and fairness metrics. FairDeFace serves as a versatile platform where any face obfuscation method can be integrated, allowing for rigorous testing and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. In its current implementation, FairDeFace incorporates 6 attacks, and several privacy, utility and fairness metrics. Using FairDeFace, and by conducting more than 500 experiments, we evaluated and compared the adversarial robustness of seven face obfuscation methods. This extensive analysis led to many interesting findings both in terms of the degree of robustness of existing methods and their biases against some gender or racial groups. FairDeFace also uses visualization of focused areas for both obfuscation and verification attacks to show not only which areas are mostly changed in the obfuscation process for some demographics, but also why they failed through focus area comparison of obfuscation and verification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automated Attendee Recognition System for Large-Scale Social Events or Conference Gathering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03330v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual attendance tracking at large-scale events, such as marriage functions or conferences, is often inefficient and prone to human error. To address this challenge, we propose an automated, cloud-based attendance tracking system that uses cameras mounted at the entrance and exit gates. The mounted cameras continuously capture video and send the video data to cloud services to perform real-time face detection and recognition. Unlike existing solutions, our system accurately identifies attendees even when they are not looking directly at the camera, allowing natural movements, such as looking around or talking while walking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system to achieve high recognition rates under such dynamic conditions.

The proposed system utilizes Range-Doppler and micro Range-Doppler Images. The architecture features a primary path (PP) responsible for the classification of in-distribution (ID) faces, complemented by intermediate paths (IPs) dedicated to OOD detection. The network is trained in two stages: first, the PP is trained using triplet loss to optimize ID face classification. In the second stage, the PP is frozen, and the IPs-comprising simple linear autoencoder networks-are trained specifically for OOD detection. Using our dataset generated with a 60 GHz FMCW radar, our method achieves an ID classification accuracy of 99.30% and an OOD detection AUROC of 96.91%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Deep Learning-based Compression Detection for explainable Face Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03619v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assessment of face image quality is crucial to ensure reliable face recognition. In order to provide data subjects and operators with explainable and actionable feedback regarding captured face images, relevant quality components have to be measured. Quality components that are known to negatively impact the utility of face images include JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression artefacts, among others. Compression can result in a loss of important image details which may impair the recognition performance. In this work, deep neural networks are trained to detect the compression artefacts in a face images. For this purpose, artefact-free facial images are compressed with the JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression algorithms. Subsequently, the PSNR and SSIM metrics are employed to obtain training labels based on which neural networks are trained using a single network to detect JPEG and JPEG 2000 artefacts, respectively. The evaluation of the proposed method shows promising results: in terms of detection accuracy, error rates of 2-3% are obtained for utilizing PSNR labels during training. In addition, we show that error rates of different open-source and commercial face recognition systems can be significantly reduced by discarding face images exhibiting severe compression artefacts. To minimize resource consumption, EfficientNetV2 serves as basis for the presented algorithm, which is available as part of the OFIQ software.</p></details> | <details><summary>2nd W...</summary><p>2nd Workshop on Fairness in Biometric Systems (FAIRBIO) at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> | None |

| **[Impact of Face Alignment on Face Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11779v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face alignment is a crucial step in preparing face images for feature extraction in facial analysis tasks. For applications such as face recognition, facial expression recognition, and facial attribute classification, alignment is widely utilized during both training and inference to standardize the positions of key landmarks in the face. It is well known that the application and method of face alignment significantly affect the performance of facial analysis models. However, the impact of alignment on face image quality has not been thoroughly investigated. Current FIQA studies often assume alignment as a prerequisite but do not explicitly evaluate how alignment affects quality metrics, especially with the advent of modern deep learning-based detectors that integrate detection and landmark localization. To address this need, our study examines the impact of face alignment on face image quality scores. We conducted experiments on the LFW, IJB-B, and SCFace datasets, employing MTCNN and RetinaFace models for face detection and alignment. To evaluate face image quality, we utilized several assessment methods, including SER-FIQ, FaceQAN, DifFIQA, and SDD-FIQA. Our analysis included examining quality score distributions for the LFW and IJB-B datasets and analyzing average quality scores at varying distances in the SCFace dataset. Our findings reveal that face image quality assessment methods are sensitive to alignment. Moreover, this sensitivity increases under challenging real-life conditions, highlighting the importance of evaluating alignment's role in quality assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EAI ROSENET 2024 - 8th EAI International Conference on Robotic Sensor Networks</p></details> | None |

Our study reveals that ChatGPT recognizes facial identities and differentiates between two facial images with considerable accuracy. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in gender detection and reasonable accuracy for the age estimation tasks. Our findings shed light on the promising potentials in the application of LLMs and foundation models for biometrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2024</p></details> | None |

Recent studies focus on using auxiliary information or prior knowledge to capture robust manipulation traces, which are shown to be promising. As one of the important face features, the face depth map, which has shown to be effective in other areas such as face recognition or face detection, is unfortunately paid little attention to in literature for face manipulation detection. In this paper, we explore the possibility of incorporating the face depth map as auxiliary information for robust face manipulation detection. To this end, we first propose a Face Depth Map Transformer (FDMT) to estimate the face depth map patch by patch from an RGB face image, which is able to capture the local depth anomaly created due to manipulation. The estimated face depth map is then considered as auxiliary information to be integrated with the backbone features using a Multi-head Depth Attention (MDA) mechanism that is newly designed. We also propose an RGB-Depth Inconsistency Attention (RDIA) module to effectively capture the inter-frame inconsistency for multi-frame input. Various experiments demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method for face manipulation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.14230</p></details> | None |

Recognition of forgeries of facial imagery is the process of classifying and defining the faces in it by analyzing real-world facial images. This process is usually accomplished by extracting features from an image, using classifier algorithms, and correctly interpreting the results. Recognizing forgeries of facial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges. For example, factors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different angles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and perspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult. Despite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of forgery detection. Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance. This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard) [10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces [61] data sets. Both data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images. In our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct forgery detection using these images. Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN architectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with newly developed lightweight CNN models. It's shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers. It's also shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models detect forgeries of facial imagery accurately, and computationally efficiently. Although the data set consists only of face images, the developed models can also be used in other two-class object recognition problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

The face recognition library was implemented with Haar Cascade Algorithm in which the 128-dimensional vectors representing the unique features of a face are encoded. A subprocess was applied where the grayscale image from Haar Cascade was converted to RGB to improve the face encoding. Logical process and face filtering are also used to decrease non-face detection. The Enhanced Haar Cascade Algorithm produced a 98.39% accuracy rate (21.39% increase), 63.59% precision rate, 98.30% recall rate, and 72.23% in F1 Score. In comparison, the Haar Cascade Algorithm achieved a 46.70% to 77.00% accuracy rate, 44.15% precision rate, 98.61% recall rate, and 47.01% in F1 Score. Both algorithms used the Confusion Matrix Test with 301,950 comparisons using the same dataset of 550 images. The 98.39% accuracy rate shows a significant decrease in false positive and false negative rates in facial recognition. Face matching and face detection are more accurate in images with complex backgrounds, lighting variations, and occlusions, or even those with similar attributes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards minimizing efforts for Morphing Attacks -- Deep embeddings for morphing pair selection and improved Morphing Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18216v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face Morphing Attacks pose a threat to the security of identity documents, especially with respect to a subsequent access control process, because it enables both individuals involved to exploit the same document. In this study, face embeddings serve two purposes: pre-selecting images for large-scale Morphing Attack generation and detecting potential Morphing Attacks. We build upon previous embedding studies in both use cases using the MagFace model. For the first objective, we employ an pre-selection algorithm that pairs individuals based on face embedding similarity. We quantify the attack potential of differently morphed face images to compare the usability of pre-selection in automatically generating numerous successful Morphing Attacks. Regarding the second objective, we compare embeddings from two state-of-the-art face recognition systems in terms of their ability to detect Morphing Attacks. Our findings demonstrate that ArcFace and MagFace provide valuable face embeddings for image pre-selection. Both open-source and COTS face recognition systems are susceptible to generated attacks, particularly when pre-selection is based on embeddings rather than random pairing which was only constrained by soft biometrics. More accurate face recognition systems exhibit greater vulnerability to attacks, with COTS systems being the most susceptible. Additionally, MagFace embeddings serve as a robust alternative for detecting morphed face images compared to the previously used ArcFace embeddings. The results endorse the advantages of face embeddings in more effective image pre-selection for face morphing and accurate detection of morphed face images. This is supported by extensive analysis of various designed attacks. The MagFace model proves to be a powerful alternative to the commonly used ArcFace model for both objectives, pre-selection and attack detection.</p></details> |  | None |

To detect such manipulated images, the development of new face morphing methods becomes essential to increase the diversity of training datasets used for face morph detection. In this study, we present a representation-level face morphing approach, namely LADIMO, that performs morphing on two face recognition embeddings. Specifically, we train a Latent Diffusion Model to invert a biometric template - thus reconstructing the face image from an FRS latent representation. Our subsequent vulnerability analysis demonstrates the high morph attack potential in comparison to MIPGAN-II, an established GAN-based face morphing approach. Finally, we exploit the stochastic LADMIO model design in combination with our identity conditioning mechanism to create unlimited morphing attacks from a single face morph image pair. We show that each face morph variant has an individual attack success rate, enabling us to maximize the morph attack potential by applying a simple re-sampling strategy.

While significant research has been done in the fields of domain adaptation and domain generalization, in this paper we tackle scenarios in which these methods have limited applicability owing to the lack of training data from target domains. We focus on the problem of single-source (visible) and multi-target (SWIR, long-range/remote, surveillance, and body-worn) face recognition task. We show through experiments that a good template generation algorithm becomes crucial as the complexity of the target domain increases. In this context, we introduce a template generation algorithm called Norm Pooling (and a variant known as Sparse Pooling) and show that it outperforms average pooling across different domains and networks, on the IARPA JANUS Benchmark Multi-domain Face (IJB-MDF) dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCB ...</summary><p>IJCB 2024 - Special Session on Recognition at Long Range and from High Altitude</p></details> | None |

| **[Differential Anomaly Detection for Facial Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03464v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their convenience and high accuracy, face recognition systems are widely employed in governmental and personal security applications to automatically recognise individuals. Despite recent advances, face recognition systems have shown to be particularly vulnerable to identity attacks (i.e., digital manipulations and attack presentations). Identity attacks pose a big security threat as they can be used to gain unauthorised access and spread misinformation. In this context, most algorithms for detecting identity attacks generalise poorly to attack types that are unknown at training time. To tackle this problem, we introduce a differential anomaly detection framework in which deep face embeddings are first extracted from pairs of images (i.e., reference and probe) and then combined for identity attack detection. The experimental evaluation conducted over several databases shows a high generalisation capability of the proposed method for detecting unknown attacks in both the digital and physical domains.</p></details> | Accepted at WIFS'21 | None |

Face forgery recognition is a standard detection method that usually follows a two-phase pipeline. While those methods perform well in ideal experimental environment, they face challenges when dealing with DeepFakes in the wild involving complex background and multiple faces of varying sizes. Moreover, most face forgery recognition methods can only process one face at a time. One straightforward way to address this issue is to simultaneous process multi-face by integrating face extraction and forgery detection in an end-to-end fashion by adapting advanced object detection architectures. However, as these object detection architectures are designed to capture the discriminative features of different object categories rather than the subtle forgery traces among the faces, the direct adaptation suffers from limited representation ability. In this paper, we propose COMICS, an end-to-end framework for multi-face forgery detection. COMICS integrates face extraction and forgery detection in a seamless manner and adapts to advanced object detection architectures. The proposed bi-grained contrastive learning approach explores face forgery traces at both the coarse- and fine-grained levels. Specifically, coarse-grained level contrastive learning captures the discriminative features among positive and negative proposal pairs at multiple layers produced by the proposal generator, and fine-grained level contrastive learning captures the pixel-wise discrepancy between the forged and original areas of the same face and the pixel-wise content inconsistency among different faces. Extensive experiments on the OpenForensics and FFIW datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other counterparts and shows great potential for being integrated into various architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

These systems typically need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such as detecting fatigue driving and recognizing the driver's identity. However, the traditional parallel-style approach of combining multiple single-task models tends to waste resources when dealing with similar tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel tree-style multi-task modeling approach for multi-task learning, which rooted at a shared backbone, more dedicated separate module branches are appended as the model pipeline goes deeper. Following the tree-style approach, we propose a multi-task learning model for simultaneously performing driver fatigue detection and face recognition for identifying a driver. This model shares a common feature extraction backbone module, with further separated feature extraction and classification module branches. The dedicated branches exploit and combine spatial and channel attention mechanisms to generate space-channel fused-attention enhanced features, leading to improved detection performance. As only single-task datasets are available, we introduce techniques including alternating updation and gradient accumulation for training our multi-task model using only the single-task datasets. The effectiveness of our tree-style multi-task learning model is verified through extensive validations.</p></details> |  | None |

Identity-preserving text-to-image generation (ID-T2I) particularly has received significant attention due to its wide range of application scenarios like AI portrait and advertising. While existing ID-T2I methods have demonstrated impressive results, several key challenges remain: (1) It is hard to maintain the identity characteristics of reference portraits accurately, (2) The generated images lack aesthetic appeal especially while enforcing identity retention, and (3) There is a limitation that cannot be compatible with LoRA-based and Adapter-based methods simultaneously. To address these issues, we present \textbf{ID-Aligner}, a general feedback learning framework to enhance ID-T2I performance. To resolve identity features lost, we introduce identity consistency reward fine-tuning to utilize the feedback from face detection and recognition models to improve generated identity preservation. Furthermore, we propose identity aesthetic reward fine-tuning leveraging rewards from human-annotated preference data and automatically constructed feedback on character structure generation to provide aesthetic tuning signals. Thanks to its universal feedback fine-tuning framework, our method can be readily applied to both LoRA and Adapter models, achieving consistent performance gains.

Typically, the modules of these systems are evaluated independently using task-specific imbalanced datasets that can misconstrue performance estimates. In this paper, we perform a thorough end-to-end evaluation of a face analytics system using a driving-specific dataset, which enables meaningful interpretations. We demonstrate how independent task evaluations, dataset imbalances, and inconsistent annotations can lead to incorrect system performance estimates. We propose strategies to create balanced evaluation subsets of our dataset and to make its annotations consistent across multiple analytics tasks and scenarios. We then evaluate the end-to-end system performance sequentially to account for task interdependencies.

We introduce a public face morphing detection benchmark for the differential scenario and utilize a specific data mining technique to enhance the performance of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting morphing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

| **[Attacking Face Recognition with T-shirts: Database, Vulnerability Assessment and Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07383v1)** | 2023-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition systems are widely deployed for biometric authentication. Despite this, it is well-known that, without any safeguards, face recognition systems are highly vulnerable to presentation attacks. In response to this security issue, several promising methods for detecting presentation attacks have been proposed which show high performance on existing benchmarks. However, an ongoing challenge is the generalization of presentation attack detection methods to unseen and new attack types. To this end, we propose a new T-shirt Face Presentation Attack (TFPA) database of 1,608 T-shirt attacks using 100 unique presentation attack instruments. In an extensive evaluation, we show that this type of attack can compromise the security of face recognition systems and that some state-of-the-art attack detection mechanisms trained on popular benchmarks fail to robustly generalize to the new attacks. Further, we propose three new methods for detecting T-shirt attack images, one which relies on the statistical differences between depth maps of bona fide images and T-shirt attacks, an anomaly detection approach trained on features only extracted from bona fide RGB images, and a fusion approach which achieves competitive detection performance.</p></details> |  | None |

In statistics the many applications of sparse modeling span regression, classification tasks, graphical model selection, sparse M-estimators and sparse dimensionality reduction. It is also particularly effective in many statistical and machine learning areas where the primary goal is to discover predictive patterns from data which would enhance our understanding and control of underlying physical, biological, and other natural processes, beyond just building accurate outcome black-box predictors. Common examples include selecting biomarkers in biological procedures, finding relevant brain activity locations which are predictive about brain states and processes based on fMRI data, and identifying network bottlenecks best explaining end-to-end performance. Moreover, the research and applications of efficient recovery of high-dimensional sparse signals from a relatively small number of observations, which is the main focus of compressed sensing or compressive sensing, have rapidly grown and became an extremely intense area of study beyond classical signal processing. Likewise interestingly, sparse modeling is directly related to various artificial vision tasks, such as image denoising, segmentation, restoration and superresolution, object or face detection and recognition in visual scenes, and action recognition. In this manuscript, we provide a brief introduction of the basic theory underlying sparse representation and compressive sensing, and then discuss some methods for recovering sparse solutions to optimization problems in effective way, together with some applications of sparse recovery in a machine learning problem known as sparse dictionary learning.</p></details> | 42 pages | None |
| **[Modeling biological face recognition with deep convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06681v3)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have become the state-of-the-art computational models of biological object recognition. Their remarkable success has helped vision science break new ground and recent efforts have started to transfer this achievement to research on biological face recognition. In this regard, face detection can be investigated by comparing face-selective biological neurons and brain areas to artificial neurons and model layers. Similarly, face identification can be examined by comparing in vivo and in silico multidimensional "face spaces". In this review, we summarize the first studies that use DCNNs to model biological face recognition. On the basis of a broad spectrum of behavioral and computational evidence, we conclude that DCNNs are useful models that closely resemble the general hierarchical organization of face recognition in the ventral visual pathway and the core face network. In two exemplary spotlights, we emphasize the unique scientific contributions of these models. First, studies on face detection in DCNNs indicate that elementary face selectivity emerges automatically through feedforward processing even in the absence of visual experience. Second, studies on face identification in DCNNs suggest that identity-specific experience and generative mechanisms facilitate this particular challenge. Taken together, as this novel modeling approach enables close control of predisposition (i.e., architecture) and experience (i.e., training data), it may be suited to inform long-standing debates on the substrates of biological face recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

The security of facial recognition is also highly regarded. The Face anti-spoofing system(FAS) for face recognition is an important component used to enhance the security of face recognition systems. Traditional FAS used images containing identity information to detect spoofing traces, however there is a risk of privacy leakage during the transmission and storage of these images. Besides, the encryption and decryption of these privacy-sensitive data takes too long compared to inference time by FAS model. To address the above issues, we propose a face anti-spoofing algorithm based on facial skin patches leveraging pure facial skin patch images as input, which contain no privacy information, no encryption or decryption is needed for these images. We conduct experiments on several public datasets, the results prove that our algorithm has demonstrated superiority in both accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the current two categories of adversarial attacks, namely digital attacks and physical attacks both have drawbacks, with the former ones impractical and the latter one conspicuous, high-computational and inexecutable. To address the issues, we propose a practical, executable, inconspicuous and low computational adversarial attack based on LED illumination modulation. To fool the systems, the proposed attack generates imperceptible luminance changes to human eyes through fast intensity modulation of scene LED illumination and uses the rolling shutter effect of CMOS image sensors in face recognition systems to implant luminance information perturbation to the captured face images. In summary,we present a denial-of-service (DoS) attack for face detection and a dodging attack for face verification. We also evaluate their effectiveness against well-known face detection models, Dlib, MTCNN and RetinaFace , and face verification models, Dlib, FaceNet,and ArcFace.The extensive experiments show that the success rates of DoS attacks against face detection models reach 97.67%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, and the success rates of dodging attacks against all face verification models reach 100%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Facial Landmark Detection Evaluation on MOBIO Database](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03329v1)** | 2023-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MOBIO is a bi-modal database that was captured almost exclusively on mobile phones. It aims to improve research into deploying biometric techniques to mobile devices. Research has been shown that face and speaker recognition can be performed in a mobile environment. Facial landmark localization aims at finding the coordinates of a set of pre-defined key points for 2D face images. A facial landmark usually has specific semantic meaning, e.g. nose tip or eye centre, which provides rich geometric information for other face analysis tasks such as face recognition, emotion estimation and 3D face reconstruction. Pretty much facial landmark detection methods adopt still face databases, such as 300W, AFW, AFLW, or COFW, for evaluation, but seldomly use mobile data. Our work is first to perform facial landmark detection evaluation on the mobile still data, i.e., face images from MOBIO database. About 20,600 face images have been extracted from this audio-visual database and manually labeled with 22 landmarks as the groundtruth. Several state-of-the-art facial landmark detection methods are adopted to evaluate their performance on these data. The result shows that the data from MOBIO database is pretty challenging. This database can be a new challenging one for facial landmark detection evaluation.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |

Although existing defense techniques achieve high accuracy in detecting some specific adversarial faces (adv-faces), new attack methods especially GAN-based attacks with completely different noise patterns circumvent them and reach a higher attack success rate. Even worse, existing techniques require attack data before implementing the defense, making it impractical to defend newly emerging attacks that are unseen to defenders. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic generality of adv-faces and propose to generate pseudo adv-faces by perturbing real faces with three heuristically designed noise patterns. We are the first to train an adv-face detector using only real faces and their self-perturbations, agnostic to victim facial recognition systems, and agnostic to unseen attacks. By regarding adv-faces as out-of-distribution data, we then naturally introduce a novel cascaded system for adv-face detection, which consists of training data self-perturbations, decision boundary regularization, and a max-pooling-based binary classifier focusing on abnormal local color aberrations. Experiments conducted on LFW and CelebA-HQ datasets with eight gradient-based and two GAN-based attacks validate that our method generalizes to a variety of unseen adversarial attacks.</p></details> | IJCAI2023 | None |

Still, many existing defense methods are only useful for small perturbations attacks and can't detect physical attacks effectively. In this paper, we propose a random-patch based defense strategy to robustly detect physical attacks for Face Recognition System (FRS). Different from mainstream defense methods which focus on building complex deep neural networks (DNN) to achieve high recognition rate on attacks, we introduce a patch based defense strategy to a standard DNN aiming to obtain robust detection models. Extensive experimental results on the employed datasets show the superiority of the proposed defense method on detecting white-box attacks and adaptive attacks which attack both FRS and the defense method. Additionally, due to the simpleness yet robustness of our method, it can be easily applied to the real world face recognition system and extended to other defense methods to boost the detection performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Creating morphing attacks is commonly either performed on the image-level or on the representation-level. The representation-level morphing has been performed so far based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) where the encoded images are interpolated in the latent space to produce a morphed image based on the interpolated vector. Such a process was constrained by the limited reconstruction fidelity of GAN architectures. Recent advances in the diffusion autoencoder models have overcome the GAN limitations, leading to high reconstruction fidelity. This theoretically makes them a perfect candidate to perform representation-level face morphing. This work investigates using diffusion autoencoders to create face morphing attacks by comparing them to a wide range of image-level and representation-level morphs. Our vulnerability analyses on four state-of-the-art face recognition models have shown that such models are highly vulnerable to the created attacks, the MorDIFF, especially when compared to existing representation-level morphs. Detailed detectability analyses are also performed on the MorDIFF, showing that they are as challenging to detect as other morphing attacks created on the image- or representation-level.

This unique ability is not supported by most enterprise LANs, which rely primarily on DiffServ-like technologies that distinguish among traffic classes rather than customers. We first show that this mismatch in QoS between the 5G network and the LAN affects the accuracy of insights from the LAN-resident analytics applications. We systematically analyze the root causes of the QoS mismatch and propose a first-of-a-kind 5G-LAN orchestrator (5GLoR). 5GLoR is a middleware that applications can use to preserve the QoS of their 5G data streams through the enterprise LAN. 5GLoR periodically analyzes the status of the queues, provides suitable DSCP identifiers to the application, and installs relevant switch re-write rules (to change DSCP identifiers between switches) to continuously preserve the QoS of the 5G data through the LAN. 5GLoR improves the RTP frame level delay and inter-frame delay by 212\% and 122\%, respectively, for the WebRTC application. Additionally, with 5GLoR, the accuracy of two example applications (face detection and recognition) improved by 33\%, while the latency was reduced by about 25\%. Our experiments show that the performance (accuracy and latency) of applications on a 5G-LAN performs well with the proposed 5GLoR compared to the same applications on MEC. This is significant because 5G-LAN offers an order of magnitude more computing, networking, and storage resources to the applications than the resource-constrained MEC, and mature enterprise technologies can be used to deploy, manage, and update IoT applications.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

NIR partial face images do not include the whole face of a subject since they are captured using iris recognition systems with the constraint of frame rate and resolution. The iris recognition systems such as the iris on the move (IOTM) system require fast and accurate eye detection as a pre-process. Our goal is to design eye detection with high speed, high discrimination performance between left and right eyes, and high positional accuracy of eye center. Our method adopts a Siamese network and coarse to fine position estimation with a fast lightweight CNN backbone. The network outputs features of images and the similarity map indicating coarse position of an eye. A regression on a portion of a feature with high similarity refines the coarse position of the eye to obtain the fine position with high accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional methods, including SOTA, in terms of the positional accuracy, the discrimination performance, and the processing speed. Our method achieves superior performance in speed.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies focus on using auxiliary information or prior knowledge to capture robust manipulation traces, which are shown to be promising. As one of the important face features, the face depth map, which has shown to be effective in other areas such as the face recognition or face detection, is unfortunately paid little attention to in literature for detecting the manipulated face images. In this paper, we explore the possibility of incorporating the face depth map as auxiliary information to tackle the problem of face manipulation detection in real world applications. To this end, we first propose a Face Depth Map Transformer (FDMT) to estimate the face depth map patch by patch from a RGB face image, which is able to capture the local depth anomaly created due to manipulation. The estimated face depth map is then considered as auxiliary information to be integrated with the backbone features using a Multi-head Depth Attention (MDA) mechanism that is newly designed. Various experiments demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method for face manipulation detection.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

Many existing algorithmic audits examine the performance of these systems on later stage elements of facial analysis systems like facial recognition and age, emotion, or perceived gender prediction; however, a core component to these systems has been vastly understudied from a fairness perspective: face detection, sometimes called face localization. Since face detection is a pre-requisite step in facial analysis systems, the bias we observe in face detection will flow downstream to the other components like facial recognition and emotion prediction. Additionally, no prior work has focused on the robustness of these systems under various perturbations and corruptions, which leaves open the question of how various people are impacted by these phenomena. We present the first of its kind detailed benchmark of face detection systems, specifically examining the robustness to noise of commercial and academic models. We use both standard and recently released academic facial datasets to quantitatively analyze trends in face detection robustness. Across all the datasets and systems, we generally find that photos of individuals who are $\textit{masculine presenting}$, $\textit{older}$, of $\textit{darker skin type}$, or have $\textit{dim lighting}$ are more susceptible to errors than their counterparts in other identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks Track 2022</p></details> | None |

Research in bias focuses primarily on facial recognition and attribute prediction with scarce emphasis on face detection. Existing studies consider face detection as binary classification into 'face' and 'non-face' classes. In this work, we investigate possible bias in the domain of face detection through facial region localization which is currently unexplored. Since facial region localization is an essential task for all face recognition pipelines, it is imperative to analyze the presence of such bias in popular deep models. Most existing face detection datasets lack suitable annotation for such analysis. Therefore, we web-curate the Fair Face Localization with Attributes (F2LA) dataset and manually annotate more than 10 attributes per face, including facial localization information. Utilizing the extensive annotations from F2LA, an experimental setup is designed to study the performance of four pre-trained face detectors. We observe (i) a high disparity in detection accuracies across gender and skin-tone, and (ii) interplay of confounding factors beyond demography.

In video surveillance based face recognition, face images are typically captured over multiple frames in uncontrolled conditions; where head pose, illumination, shadowing, motion blur and focus change over the sequence. We can generalize that the three fundamental operations involved in the facial recognition tasks: face detection, face alignment and face recognition. This study presents comparative benchmark tables for the state-of-art face recognition methods by testing them with same backbone architecture in order to focus only on the face recognition solution instead of network architecture. For this purpose, we constructed a video surveillance dataset of face IDs that has high age variance, intra-class variance (face make-up, beard, etc.) with native surveillance facial imagery data for evaluation. On the other hand, this work discovers the best recognition methods for different conditions like non-masked faces, masked faces, and faces with glasses.</p></details> |  | None |

Face recognition consists of three sub-task: face detection, face normalizing and face identification. Most of animal face recognition study focuses on face detection and face identification. Animals are often uncooperative when taking photos, so the collected animal face images are often in arbitrary directions. The use of non-standard images may significantly reduce the performance of face recognition system. However, there is no study on normalizing of the animal face image with arbitrary directions. In this study, we developed a light-weight angle detection and region-based convolutional network (LAD-RCNN) containing a new rotation angle coding method that can detect the rotation angle and the location of animal face in one-stage. LAD-RCNN has a frame rate of 72.74 FPS (including all steps) on a single GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. LAD-RCNN has been evaluated on multiple dataset including goat dataset and gaot infrared image. Evaluation result show that the AP of face detection was more than 95% and the deviation between the detected rotation angle and the ground-truth rotation angle were less than 0.036 (i.e. 6.48°) on all the test dataset. This shows that LAD-RCNN has excellent performance on livestock face and its direction detection, and therefore it is very suitable for livestock face detection and Normalizing.

However, they can distort or modify biometric features, severely affecting the capability of recognizing individuals' identity or even detecting the face. Accordingly, we address the effect of such filters on the accuracy of automated face detection and recognition. The social media image filters studied either modify the image contrast or illumination or occlude parts of the face with for example artificial glasses or animal noses. We observe that the effect of some of these filters is harmful both to face detection and identity recognition, specially if they obfuscate the eye or (to a lesser extent) the nose. To counteract such effect, we develop a method to reconstruct the applied manipulation with a modified version of the U-NET segmentation network. This is observed to contribute to a better face detection and recognition accuracy. From a recognition perspective, we employ distance measures and trained machine learning algorithms applied to features extracted using a ResNet-34 network trained to recognize faces. We also evaluate if incorporating filtered images to the training set of machine learning approaches are beneficial for identity recognition. Our results show good recognition when filters do not occlude important landmarks, specially the eyes (identification accuracy >99%, EER92% with the majority of perturbations evaluated, and an EER 12% (EER)</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Pattern Recognition Letters, 2022</p></details> | None |

Inspired by the recent image inpainting methods, we propose an end-to-end hybrid masked face recognition system, namely HiMFR, consisting of three significant parts: masked face detector, face inpainting, and face recognition. The masked face detector module applies a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT\_b32) to detect whether faces are covered with masked or not. The inpainting module uses a fine-tune image inpainting model based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to restore faces. Finally, the hybrid face recognition module based on ViT with an EfficientNetB3 backbone recognizes the faces.

In a sole vision-based solution, the first step generates multiple detection for a single identity by ingesting a camera stream. A practical approach on edge devices should prioritize these detection of identities according to their conformity to recognition. In this perspective, we propose a face quality score regression by just appending a single layer to a face landmark detection network. With almost no additional cost, face quality scores are obtained by training this single layer to regress recognition scores with surveillance like augmentations. We implemented the proposed approach on edge GPUs with all face detection pipeline steps, including detection, tracking, and alignment. Comprehensive experiments show the proposed approach's efficiency through comparison with SOTA face quality regression models on different data sets and real-life scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV2020-Embedded Vision Workshop</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a generic Explainable Channel Loss (ECLoss) to construct an explainable face recognition network. The explainable network trained with ECLoss can easily learn the facial part-based representation on the target convolutional layer, where an individual channel can detect a certain face part. Our experiments on dozens of datasets show that ECLoss achieves superior explainability metrics, and at the same time improves the performance of face verification without face alignment.

It reveals the vulnerability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as state-of-the-art building block for face recognition models against adversarial examples, which can cause certain consequences for secure systems. Gradient-based adversarial attacks are widely studied before and proved to be successful against face recognition models. However, finding the optimized perturbation per each face needs to submitting the significant number of queries to the target model. In this paper, we propose recursive adversarial attack on face recognition using automatic face warping which needs extremely limited number of queries to fool the target model. Instead of a random face warping procedure, the warping functions are applied on specific detected regions of face like eyebrows, nose, lips, etc. We evaluate the robustness of proposed method in the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model parameters and gradients, but hard-label predictions and confidence scores are provided by the target model.</p></details> |  | None |

While it is convenient, it is challenging for teachers to supervise online exams from simultaneously displayed student Zoom windows. In this paper, we propose iExam, an intelligent online exam monitoring and analysis system that can not only use face detection to assist invigilators in real-time student identification, but also be able to detect common abnormal behaviors (including face disappearing, rotating faces, and replacing with a different person during the exams) via a face recognition-based post-exam video analysis. To build such a novel system in its first kind, we overcome three challenges. First, we discover a lightweight approach to capturing exam video streams and analyzing them in real time. Second, we utilize the left-corner names that are displayed on each student's Zoom window and propose an improved OCR (optical character recognition) technique to automatically gather the ground truth for the student faces with dynamic positions. Third, we perform several experimental comparisons and optimizations to efficiently shorten the training and testing time required on teachers' PC. Our evaluation shows that iExam achieves high accuracy, 90.4% for real-time face detection and 98.4% for post-exam face recognition, while maintaining acceptable runtime performance. We have made iExam's source code available at https://github.com/VPRLab/iExam.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from the Chinese University of Hong Kong</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/VPRLab/iExam) |

In this paper, we explore the effects of face obfuscation on the popular ImageNet challenge visual recognition benchmark. Most categories in the ImageNet challenge are not people categories; however, many incidental people appear in the images, and their privacy is a concern. We first annotate faces in the dataset. Then we demonstrate that face obfuscation has minimal impact on the accuracy of recognition models. Concretely, we benchmark multiple deep neural networks on obfuscated images and observe that the overall recognition accuracy drops only slightly (<= 1.0%). Further, we experiment with transfer learning to 4 downstream tasks (object recognition, scene recognition, face attribute classification, and object detection) and show that features learned on obfuscated images are equally transferable. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of privacy-aware visual recognition, improves the highly-used ImageNet challenge benchmark, and suggests an important path for future visual datasets.

The widespread use of FR systems has raised concerns about the safety of face biometrics against spoofing attacks, which use the use of a photo or video of a legitimate user's face to gain illegal access to the resources or activities. Despite the development of several FAS or liveness detection methods (which determine whether a face is live or spoofed at the time of acquisition), the problem remains unsolved due to the difficulty of identifying discrimination and operationally reasonably priced spoof characteristics but also approaches. Additionally, certain facial portions are frequently repeated or correlate to image clutter, resulting in poor performance overall. This research proposes a face-anti-spoofing neural network model that outperforms existing models and has an efficiency of 0.89 percent.</p></details> | 9 Pages | None |

This form of attack presents an important issue in applications relying on identity documents such as border security or access control. Research in generation of face morphs and their detection is developing rapidly, however very few datasets with morphing attacks and open-source detection toolkits are publicly available. This paper bridges this gap by providing two datasets and the corresponding code for four types of morphing attacks: two that rely on facial landmarks based on OpenCV and FaceMorpher, and two that use StyleGAN 2 to generate synthetic morphs. We also conduct extensive experiments to assess the vulnerability of four state-of-the-art face recognition systems, including FaceNet, VGG-Face, ArcFace, and ISV. Surprisingly, the experiments demonstrate that, although visually more appealing, morphs based on StyleGAN 2 do not pose a significant threat to the state to face recognition systems, as these morphs were outmatched by the simple morphs that are based facial landmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2012.05344</p></details> | None |

In this work, we assess the impact of doppelgängers on the HDA Doppelgänger and Disguised Faces in The Wild databases using a state-of-the-art face recognition system. It is found that doppelgänger image pairs yield very high similarity scores resulting in a significant increase of false match rates. Further, we propose a doppelgänger detection method which distinguishes doppelgängers from mated comparison trials by analysing differences in deep representations obtained from face image pairs. The proposed detection system employs a machine learning-based classifier, which is trained with generated doppelgänger image pairs utilising face morphing techniques. Experimental evaluations conducted on the HDA Doppelgänger and Look-Alike Face databases reveal a detection equal error rate of approximately 2.7% for the task of separating mated authentication attempts from doppelgängers.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in IET Biometrics</p></details> | None |

These approaches are insufficient when handling outlier cases, for example when trying to detect the face of a neonate infant whose face composition and expressions are relatively different than that of the adult. It is furthermore difficult when applied to detect faces in a complicated setting such as the Neonate Intensive Care Unit. By training a state-of-the-art face detection model, You-Only-Look-Once, on a proprietary dataset containing labelled neonate faces in a clinical setting, this work achieves near real time neonate face detection. Our preliminary findings show an accuracy of 68.7%, compared to the off the shelf solution which detected neonate faces with an accuracy of 7.37%. Although further experiments are needed to validate our model, our results are promising and prove the feasibility of detecting neonatal faces in challenging real-world settings. The robust and real-time detection of neonatal faces would benefit wide range of automated systems (e.g., pain recognition and surveillance) who currently suffer from the time and effort due to the necessity of manual annotations.

Based on a qualitative assessment and classification of freely available mobile applications, ten relevant fun selfie filters are selected to create a database. To this end, the selected filters are automatically applied to face images of public face image databases. Different state-of-the-art methods are used to evaluate the influence of fun selfie filters on the performance of face detection using dlib, RetinaFace, and a COTS method, sample quality estimated by FaceQNet and MagFace, and recognition accuracy employing ArcFace and a COTS algorithm. The obtained results indicate that selfie filters negatively affect face recognition modules, especially if fun selfie filters cover a large region of the face, where the mouth, nose, and eyes are covered. To mitigate such unwanted effects, a GAN-based selfie filter removal algorithm is proposed which consists of a segmentation module, a perceptual network, and a generation module. In a cross-database experiment the application of the presented selfie filter removal technique has shown to significantly improve the biometric performance of the underlying face recognition systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Psychophysical Evaluation of Human Performance in Detecting Digital Face Image Manipulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12084v1)** | 2022-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, increasing deployment of face recognition technology in security-critical settings, such as border control or law enforcement, has led to considerable interest in the vulnerability of face recognition systems to attacks utilising legitimate documents, which are issued on the basis of digitally manipulated face images. As automated manipulation and attack detection remains a challenging task, conventional processes with human inspectors performing identity verification remain indispensable. These circumstances merit a closer investigation of human capabilities in detecting manipulated face images, as previous work in this field is sparse and often concentrated only on specific scenarios and biometric characteristics. This work introduces a web-based, remote visual discrimination experiment on the basis of principles adopted from the field of psychophysics and subsequently discusses interdisciplinary opportunities with the aim of examining human proficiency in detecting different types of digitally manipulated face images, specifically face swapping, morphing, and retouching. In addition to analysing appropriate performance measures, a possible metric of detectability is explored. Experimental data of 306 probands indicate that detection performance is widely distributed across the population and detection of certain types of face image manipulations is much more challenging than others.</p></details> |  | None |

Automatically assessing the quality of face data in terms of biometric utility can thus be useful to detect low-quality data and make decisions accordingly. This survey provides an overview of the face image quality assessment literature, which predominantly focuses on visible wavelength face image input. A trend towards deep learning based methods is observed, including notable conceptual differences among the recent approaches, such as the integration of quality assessment into face recognition models. Besides image selection, face image quality assessment can also be used in a variety of other application scenarios, which are discussed herein. Open issues and challenges are pointed out, i.a. highlighting the importance of comparability for algorithm evaluations, and the challenge for future work to create deep learning approaches that are interpretable in addition to providing accurate utility predictions.</p></details> |  | None |

With the recent development of deep learning techniques and large-scale datasets, deep face recognition has made remarkable progress and been widely used in many real-world applications. Given a natural image or video frame as input, an end-to-end deep face recognition system outputs the face feature for recognition. To achieve this, a typical end-to-end system is built with three key elements: face detection, face alignment, and face representation. The face detection locates faces in the image or frame. Then, the face alignment is proceeded to calibrate the faces to the canonical view and crop them with a normalized pixel size. Finally, in the stage of face representation, the discriminative features are extracted from the aligned face for recognition. Nowadays, all of the three elements are fulfilled by the technique of deep convolutional neural network. In this survey article, we present a comprehensive review about the recent advance of each element. To start with, we present an overview of the end-to-end deep face recognition. Then, we review the advance of each element, respectively, covering many aspects such as the to-date algorithm designs, evaluation metrics, datasets, performance comparison, existing challenges, and promising directions for future research. Also, we provide a detailed discussion about the effect of each element on its subsequent elements and the holistic system. Through this survey, we wish to bring contributions in two aspects: first, readers can conveniently identify the methods which are quite strong-baseline style in the subcategory for further exploration; second, one can also employ suitable methods for establishing a state-of-the-art end-to-end face recognition system from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> | None |

Many applications including face recognition, facial expression recognition, face tracking and head-pose estimation assume that both the location and the size of faces are known in the image. In recent decades, researchers have created many typical and efficient face detectors from the Viola-Jones face detector to current CNN-based ones. However, with the tremendous increase in images and videos with variations in face scale, appearance, expression, occlusion and pose, traditional face detectors are challenged to detect various "in the wild" faces. The emergence of deep learning techniques brought remarkable breakthroughs to face detection along with the price of a considerable increase in computation. This paper introduces representative deep learning-based methods and presents a deep and thorough analysis in terms of accuracy and efficiency. We further compare and discuss the popular and challenging datasets and their evaluation metrics. A comprehensive comparison of several successful deep learning-based face detectors is conducted to uncover their efficiency using two metrics: FLOPs and latency. The paper can guide to choose appropriate face detectors for different applications and also to develop more efficient and accurate detectors.</p></details> |  | None |

In addition, we present the vulnerabilities and the possible attacks that a face recognition system may be exposed to, showing that way the high importance of presentation attack detection methods.

Despite recent advancements in facial recognition systems, presentation attacks on facial recognition systems have become increasingly sophisticated. The ability to detect presentation attacks or spoofing attempts is a pressing concern for the integrity, security, and trust of facial recognition systems. Multi-spectral imaging has been previously introduced as a way to improve presentation attack detection by utilizing sensors that are sensitive to different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., visible, near infrared, long-wave infrared). Although multi-spectral presentation attack detection systems may be discriminative, the need for additional sensors and computational resources substantially increases complexity and costs. Instead, we propose a method that exploits information from infrared imagery during training to increase the discriminability of visible-based presentation attack detection systems. We introduce (1) a new cross-domain presentation attack detection framework that increases the separability of bonafide and presentation attacks using only visible spectrum imagery, (2) an inverse domain regularization technique for added training stability when optimizing our cross-domain presentation attack detection framework, and (3) a dense domain adaptation subnetwork to transform representations between visible and non-visible domains.</p></details> |  | None |

In collaborative learning videos, students sit around a typical table at different positions to the recording camera, come and go, move around, get partially or fully occluded. Furthermore, the videos tend to be very long, requiring the development of fast and accurate methods. We develop a dynamic system of recognizing participants in collaborative learning systems. We address occlusion and recognition failures by using past information about the face detection history. We address the need for detecting faces from different poses and the need for speed by associating each participant with a collection of prototype faces computed through sampling or K-means clustering. Our results show that the proposed system is proven to be very fast and accurate. We also compare our system against a baseline system that uses InsightFace [2] and the original training video segments. We achieved an average accuracy of 86.2% compared to 70.8% for the baseline system. On average, our recognition rate was 28.1 times faster than the baseline system.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Experimental Evaluation on Deepfake Detection using Deep Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01640v1)** | 2021-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant advances in deep learning have obtained hallmark accuracy rates for various computer vision applications. However, advances in deep generative models have also led to the generation of very realistic fake content, also known as deepfakes, causing a threat to privacy, democracy, and national security. Most of the current deepfake detection methods are deemed as a binary classification problem in distinguishing authentic images or videos from fake ones using two-class convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods are based on detecting visual artifacts, temporal or color inconsistencies produced by deep generative models. However, these methods require a large amount of real and fake data for model training and their performance drops significantly in cross dataset evaluation with samples generated using advanced deepfake generation techniques. In this paper, we thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of deep face recognition in identifying deepfakes, using different loss functions and deepfake generation techniques. Experimental investigations on challenging Celeb-DF and FaceForensics++ deepfake datasets suggest the efficacy of deep face recognition in identifying deepfakes over two-class CNNs and the ocular modality. Reported results suggest a maximum Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.98 and an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 7.1% in detecting deepfakes using face recognition on the Celeb-DF dataset. This EER is lower by 16.6% compared to the EER obtained for the two-class CNN and the ocular modality on the Celeb-DF dataset. Further on the FaceForensics++ dataset, an AUC of 0.99 and EER of 2.04% were obtained. The use of biometric facial recognition technology has the advantage of bypassing the need for a large amount of fake data for model training and obtaining better generalizability to evolving deepfake creation techniques.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures | None |

One of the key goals is to have a balanced performance of masked and standard face recognition. In order to prevent the overfitting for the masked face recognition, we control the total number of masked faces by not more than 10\% of the total face recognition in the training dataset. We propose a few key changes to the face recognition network including a new stem unit, drop block, face detection and alignment using YOLO5Face, feature concatenation, a cycle cosine learning rate, etc. With this strategy, we achieve good and balanced performance for both masked and standard face recognition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harnessing Unrecognizable Faces for Improving Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04112v2)** | 2021-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The common implementation of face recognition systems as a cascade of a detection stage and a recognition or verification stage can cause problems beyond failures of the detector. When the detector succeeds, it can detect faces that cannot be recognized, no matter how capable the recognition system. Recognizability, a latent variable, should therefore be factored into the design and implementation of face recognition systems. We propose a measure of recognizability of a face image that leverages a key empirical observation: an embedding of face images, implemented by a deep neural network trained using mostly recognizable identities, induces a partition of the hypersphere whereby unrecognizable identities cluster together. This occurs regardless of the phenomenon that causes a face to be unrecognizable, it be optical or motion blur, partial occlusion, spatial quantization, poor illumination. Therefore, we use the distance from such an "unrecognizable identity" as a measure of recognizability, and incorporate it in the design of the over-all system. We show that accounting for recognizability reduces error rate of single-image face recognition by 58% at FAR=1e-5 on the IJB-C Covariate Verification benchmark, and reduces verification error rate by 24% at FAR=1e-5 in set-based recognition on the IJB-C benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Face Hallucination via Split-Attention in Split-Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11575v3)** | 2021-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely employed to promote the face hallucination due to the ability to predict high-frequency details from a large number of samples. However, most of them fail to take into account the overall facial profile and fine texture details simultaneously, resulting in reduced naturalness and fidelity of the reconstructed face, and further impairing the performance of downstream tasks (e.g., face detection, facial recognition). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel external-internal split attention group (ESAG), which encompasses two paths responsible for facial structure information and facial texture details, respectively. By fusing the features from these two paths, the consistency of facial structure and the fidelity of facial details are strengthened at the same time. Then, we propose a split-attention in split-attention network (SISN) to reconstruct photorealistic high-resolution facial images by cascading several ESAGs. Experimental results on face hallucination and face recognition unveil that the proposed method not only significantly improves the clarity of hallucinated faces, but also encourages the subsequent face recognition performance substantially.

However, the lack of availability of face databases with a variety of disguise addons limits the development of academic research in the area.

We also present baseline face detection results performed on the proposed database to provide reference results and compare the performance in different modalities.

Notwithstanding those improvements, several challenges which affect the performance of face recognition systems remain. In this work, we investigate the impact that facial tattoos and paintings have on current face recognition systems. To this end, we first collected an appropriate database containing image-pairs of individuals with and without facial tattoos or paintings. The assembled database was used to evaluate how facial tattoos and paintings affect the detection, quality estimation, as well as the feature extraction and comparison modules of a face recognition system. The impact on these modules was evaluated using state-of-the-art open-source and commercial systems. The obtained results show that facial tattoos and paintings affect all the tested modules, especially for images where a large area of the face is covered with tattoos or paintings. Our work is an initial case-study and indicates a need to design algorithms which are robust to the visual changes caused by facial tattoos and paintings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IET Biometrics</p></details> | None |
| **[Open-set Face Recognition for Small Galleries Using Siamese Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06967v1)** | 2021-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition has been one of the most relevant and explored fields of Biometrics. In real-world applications, face recognition methods usually must deal with scenarios where not all probe individuals were seen during the training phase (open-set scenarios). Therefore, open-set face recognition is a subject of increasing interest as it deals with identifying individuals in a space where not all faces are known in advance. This is useful in several applications, such as access authentication, on which only a few individuals that have been previously enrolled in a gallery are allowed. The present work introduces a novel approach towards open-set face recognition focusing on small galleries and in enrollment detection, not identity retrieval. A Siamese Network architecture is proposed to learn a model to detect if a face probe is enrolled in the gallery based on a verification-like approach. Promising results were achieved for small galleries on experiments carried out on Pubfig83, FRGCv1 and LFW datasets. State-of-the-art methods like HFCN and HPLS were outperformed on FRGCv1. Besides, a new evaluation protocol is introduced for experiments in small galleries on LFW.</p></details> |  | None |

However, racial bias had been proven to be inherent in most State Of The Art (SOTA) face recognition systems. Many investigative studies on face recognition algorithms have reported higher false positive rates of African subjects cohorts than the other cohorts. Lack of large-scale African face image databases in public domain is one of the main restrictions in studying the racial bias problem of face recognition. To this end, we collect a face image database namely CASIA-Face-Africa which contains 38,546 images of 1,183 African subjects. Multi-spectral cameras are utilized to capture the face images under various illumination settings. Demographic attributes and facial expressions of the subjects are also carefully recorded. For landmark detection, each face image in the database is manually labeled with 68 facial keypoints. A group of evaluation protocols are constructed according to different applications, tasks, partitions and scenarios. The performances of SOTA face recognition algorithms without re-training are reported as baselines. The proposed database along with its face landmark annotations, evaluation protocols and preliminary results form a good benchmark to study the essential aspects of face biometrics for African subjects, especially face image preprocessing, face feature analysis and matching, facial expression recognition, sex/age estimation, ethnic classification, face image generation, etc. The database can be downloaded from our http://www.cripacsir.cn/dataset/</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the journal IEEE TIFS</p></details> | None |

We have designed our datasets named LRD200 and LRD100, which have been used for training and classification. The face detection part uses the Viola-Jones algorithm, and the face recognition part receives the face image from the face detection part to process it using the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm with preprocessing using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and face alignment. The face database in this system can be updated via our custom-built standalone android app and automatic restarting of the training and recognition process with an updated database. Using our proposed algorithm, a real-time face recognition accuracy of 78.40% at 15 px and 98.05% at 45 px have been achieved using the LRD200 database containing 200 images per person. With 100 images per person in the database (LRD100) the achieved accuracies are 60.60% at 15 px and 95% at 45 px respectively. A facial deflection of about 30 degrees on either side from the front face showed an average face recognition precision of 72.25% - 81.85%. This face recognition system can be employed for law enforcement purposes, where the surveillance camera captures a low-resolution image because of the distance of a person from the camera. It can also be used as a surveillance system in airports, bus stations, etc., to reduce the risk of possible criminal threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal, Optics and Photonics Journal</p></details> | None |

However, there is no research which studies the influence of glass factor in facial recognition system. This paper provides a comprehensive review of glass factor. The study contains two steps: data collection and accuracy test. Data collection includes collecting human face images through different situations, such as clear glasses, glass with water and glass with mist. Based on the collected data, an existing state-of-the-art face detection and recognition system built upon MTCNN and Inception V1 deep nets is tested for further analysis. Experimental data supports that 1) the system is robust for classification when comparing real-time images and 2) it fails at determining if two images are of same person by comparing real-time disturbed image with the frontal ones.</p></details> |  | None |

Among them, face detection, landmark detection and representation learning have long been studied and a lot of works have been proposed. As an essential step with a significant impact on recognition performance, the alignment step has attracted little attention. In this paper, we first explore and highlight the effects of different alignment templates on face recognition. Then, for the first time, we try to search for the optimal template automatically. We construct a well-defined searching space by decomposing the template searching into the crop size and vertical shift, and propose an efficient method Face Alignment Policy Search (FAPS). Besides, a well-designed benchmark is proposed to evaluate the searched policy. Experiments on our proposed benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method to improve face recognition performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2021</p></details> | None |

Amidst the classically used biometrics, voice and face attributes are the most propitious for prevalent applications in day-to-day life because they are easy to obtain through restrained and user-friendly procedures. The pervasiveness of low-cost audio and face capture sensors in smartphones, laptops, and tablets has made the advantage of voice and face biometrics more exceptional when compared to other biometrics. For many years, acoustic information alone has been a great success in automatic speaker verification applications. Meantime, the last decade or two has also witnessed a remarkable ascent in face recognition technologies. Nonetheless, in adverse unconstrained environments, neither of these techniques achieves optimal performance. Since audio-visual information carries correlated and complementary information, integrating them into one recognition system can increase the system's performance. The vulnerability of biometrics towards presentation attacks and audio-visual data usage for the detection of such attacks is also a hot topic of research. This paper made a comprehensive survey on existing state-of-the-art audio-visual recognition techniques, publicly available databases for benchmarking, and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithms. Further, a detailed discussion on challenges and open problems is presented in this field of biometrics.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite of the good performance obtained by state-of-the-art approaches on digital images, no satisfactory solutions have been identified so far to deal with cross-database testing and printed-scanned images (typically used in many countries for document issuing). In this work, novel approaches are proposed to train Deep Neural Networks for morphing detection: in particular generation of simulated printed-scanned images together with other data augmentation strategies and pre-training on large face recognition datasets, allowed to reach state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging datasets from heterogeneous image sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a preprint of a paper accepted by IET Biometrics and is subject to Institution of Engineering and Technology Copyright.

| **[Detection of Makeup Presentation Attacks based on Deep Face Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05074v2)** | 2021-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial cosmetics have the ability to substantially alter the facial appearance, which can negatively affect the decisions of a face recognition. In addition, it was recently shown that the application of makeup can be abused to launch so-called makeup presentation attacks. In such attacks, the attacker might apply heavy makeup in order to achieve the facial appearance of a target subject for the purpose of impersonation. In this work, we assess the vulnerability of a COTS face recognition system to makeup presentation attacks employing the publicly available Makeup Induced Face Spoofing (MIFS) database. It is shown that makeup presentation attacks might seriously impact the security of the face recognition system. Further, we propose an attack detection scheme which distinguishes makeup presentation attacks from genuine authentication attempts by analysing differences in deep face representations obtained from potential makeup presentation attacks and corresponding target face images. The proposed detection system employs a machine learning-based classifier, which is trained with synthetically generated makeup presentation attacks utilizing a generative adversarial network for facial makeup transfer in conjunction with image warping. Experimental evaluations conducted using the MIFS database reveal a detection equal error rate of 0.7% for the task of separating genuine authentication attempts from makeup presentation attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published at 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'2020)</p></details> | None |

Patients with PD present a reduction in facial movements called hypomimia which is evaluated in item 3.2 of the MDS-UPDRS-III scale. In this work, we propose to use facial expression analysis from face images based on affective domains to improve PD detection. We propose different domain adaptation techniques to exploit the latest advances in face recognition and Face Action Unit (FAU) detection. The principal contributions of this work are: (1) a novel framework to exploit deep face architectures to model hypomimia in PD patients; (2) we experimentally compare PD detection based on single images vs. image sequences while the patients are evoked various face expressions; (3) we explore different domain adaptation techniques to exploit existing models initially trained either for Face Recognition or to detect FAUs for the automatic discrimination between PD patients and healthy subjects; and (4) a new approach to use triplet-loss learning to improve hypomimia modeling and PD detection. The results on real face images from PD patients show that we are able to properly model evoked emotions using image sequences (neutral, onset-transition, apex, offset-transition, and neutral) with accuracy improvements up to 5.5% (from 72.9% to 78.4%) with respect to single-image PD detection. We also show that our proposed affective-domain adaptation provides improvements in PD detection up to 8.9% (from 78.4% to 87.3% detection accuracy).</p></details> |  | None |

However, capturing a sufficiently large dataset with specific control over the attributes of interest is difficult. In this work, we describe a simulator that applies specific head pose and facial expression adjustments to images of previously unseen people. The simulator first fits a 3D morphable model to a provided image, applies the desired head pose and facial expression controls, then renders the model into an image. Next, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) conditioned on the original image and the rendered morphable model is used to produce the image of the original person with the new facial expression and head pose. We call this conditional GAN -- MorphGAN. Images generated using MorphGAN conserve the identity of the person in the original image, and the provided control over head pose and facial expression allows test sets to be created to identify robustness issues of a facial recognition deep network with respect to pose and expression. Images generated by MorphGAN can also serve as data augmentation when training data are scarce. We show that by augmenting small datasets of faces with new poses and expressions improves the recognition performance by up to 9% depending on the augmentation and data scarcity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Vulnerability Analysis of Face Morphing Attacks from Landmarks and Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05344v1)** | 2020-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Morphing attacks is a threat to biometric systems where the biometric reference in an identity document can be altered. This form of attack presents an important issue in applications relying on identity documents such as border security or access control. Research in face morphing attack detection is developing rapidly, however very few datasets with several forms of attacks are publicly available. This paper bridges this gap by providing a new dataset with four different types of morphing attacks, based on OpenCV, FaceMorpher, WebMorph and a generative adversarial network (StyleGAN), generated with original face images from three public face datasets. We also conduct extensive experiments to assess the vulnerability of the state-of-the-art face recognition systems, notably FaceNet, VGG-Face, and ArcFace. The experiments demonstrate that VGG-Face, while being less accurate face recognition system compared to FaceNet, is also less vulnerable to morphing attacks. Also, we observed that naïve morphs generated with a StyleGAN do not pose a significant threat.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2021</p></details> | None |

| **[Detection of Face Recognition Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02918v1)** | 2020-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning methods have become state-of-the-art for solving tasks such as Face Recognition (FR). Unfortunately, despite their success, it has been pointed out that these learning models are exposed to adversarial inputs - images to which an imperceptible amount of noise for humans is added to maliciously fool a neural network - thus limiting their adoption in real-world applications. While it is true that an enormous effort has been spent in order to train robust models against this type of threat, adversarial detection techniques have recently started to draw attention within the scientific community. A detection approach has the advantage that it does not require to re-train any model, thus it can be added on top of any system. In this context, we present our work on adversarial samples detection in forensics mainly focused on detecting attacks against FR systems in which the learning model is typically used only as a features extractor. Thus, in these cases, train a more robust classifier might not be enough to defence a FR system. In this frame, the contribution of our work is four-fold: i) we tested our recently proposed adversarial detection approach against classifier attacks, i.e. adversarial samples crafted to fool a FR neural network acting as a classifier; ii) using a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm as a guidance, we generated deep features attacks against a FR system based on a DL model acting as features extractor, followed by a kNN which gives back the query identity based on features similarity; iii) we used the deep features attacks to fool a FR system on the 1:1 Face Verification task and we showed their superior effectiveness with respect to classifier attacks in fooling such type of system; iv) we used the detectors trained on classifier attacks to detect deep features attacks, thus showing that such approach is generalizable to different types of offensives.</p></details> |  | None |

However, over the last decade data processing capability of computers has increased manifold, which has made real-time video content analysis possible. This shows that the need of the hour is a robust and highly automated Face Detection and Recognition algorithm with credible accuracy rate. The proposed Face Detection and Recognition system using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) accepts face frames as input from a database containing images from low cost devices such as VGA cameras, webcams or even CCTV's, where image quality is inferior. Face region is then detected using properties of L*a*b* color space and only Frontal Face is extracted such that all additional background is eliminated. Further, this extracted image is converted to grayscale and its dimensions are resized to 128 x 128 pixels. DWT is then applied to entire image to obtain the coefficients. Recognition is carried out by comparison of the DWT coefficients belonging to the test image with those of the registered reference image. On comparison, Euclidean distance classifier is deployed to validate the test image from the database. Accuracy for various levels of DWT Decomposition is obtained and hence, compared.</p></details> | <details><summary>discr...</summary><p>discrete wavelet transform, face detection, face recognition, person identification</p></details> | None |

Face swapping methods, such as DeepFake, manipulate the face region, aiming to adjust the face to the appearance of its context, while leaving the context unchanged. We show that this modus operandi produces discrepancies between the two regions. These discrepancies offer exploitable telltale signs of manipulation. Our approach involves two networks: (i) a face identification network that considers the face region bounded by a tight semantic segmentation, and (ii) a context recognition network that considers the face context (e.g., hair, ears, neck). We describe a method which uses the recognition signals from our two networks to detect such discrepancies, providing a complementary detection signal that improves conventional real vs. fake classifiers commonly used for detecting fake images. Our method achieves state of the art results on the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF-v2, and DFDC benchmarks for face manipulation detection, and even generalizes to detect fakes produced by unseen methods.</p></details> |  | None |

People are encouraged to cover their faces when in public area to avoid the spread of infection. The use of these face masks has raised a serious question on the accuracy of the facial recognition system used for tracking school/office attendance and to unlock phones. Many organizations use facial recognition as a means of authentication and have already developed the necessary datasets in-house to be able to deploy such a system. Unfortunately, masked faces make it difficult to be detected and recognized, thereby threatening to make the in-house datasets invalid and making such facial recognition systems inoperable. This paper addresses a methodology to use the current facial datasets by augmenting it with tools that enable masked faces to be recognized with low false-positive rates and high overall accuracy, without requiring the user dataset to be recreated by taking new pictures for authentication. We present an open-source tool, MaskTheFace to mask faces effectively creating a large dataset of masked faces. The dataset generated with this tool is then used towards training an effective facial recognition system with target accuracy for masked faces. We report an increase of 38% in the true positive rate for the Facenet system. We also test the accuracy of re-trained system on a custom real-world dataset MFR2 and report similar accuracy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

Our ByeGlassesGAN consists of an encoder, a face decoder, and a segmentation decoder. The encoder is responsible for extracting information from the source face image, and the face decoder utilizes this information to generate glasses-removed images. The segmentation decoder is included to predict the segmentation mask of eyeglasses and completed face region. The feature vectors generated by the segmentation decoder are shared with the face decoder, which facilitates better reconstruction results. Our experiments show that ByeGlassesGAN can provide visually appealing results in the eyeglasses-removed face images even for semi-transparent color eyeglasses or glasses with glare. Furthermore, we demonstrate significant improvement in face recognition accuracy for face images with glasses by applying our method as a pre-processing step in our face recognition experiment.</p></details> |  | None |

Face Presentation Attack Detection with a Multi-Channel Face Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16836v2)** | 2020-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a typical face recognition pipeline, the task of the face detector is to localize the face region. However, the face detector localizes regions that look like a face, irrespective of the liveliness of the face, which makes the entire system susceptible to presentation attacks. In this work, we try to reformulate the task of the face detector to detect real faces, thus eliminating the threat of presentation attacks. While this task could be challenging with visible spectrum images alone, we leverage the multi-channel information available from off the shelf devices (such as color, depth, and infrared channels) to design a multi-channel face detector. The proposed system can be used as a live-face detector obviating the need for a separate presentation attack detection module, making the system reliable in practice without any additional computational overhead. The main idea is to leverage a single-stage object detection framework, with a joint representation obtained from different channels for the PAD task. We have evaluated our approach in the multi-channel WMCA dataset containing a wide variety of attacks to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

However, very less work has been done on extending them to multiclass classification. The proposed approach is a viable effort in this direction. It uses one-class CNNs i.e., it trains one CNN per class, for multiclass classification. An ensemble of such one-class CNNs is used for multiclass classification. The benefits of the approach are generally better recognition accuracy while taking almost even half or two-thirds of the training time of a conventional multi-class deep network. The proposed approach has been applied successfully to face recognition and object recognition tasks. For face recognition, a 1000 frame RGB video, featuring many faces together, has been used for benchmarking of the proposed approach. Its database is available on request via e-mail.

The dataset, named iCartoonFace, is currently the largest-scale, high-quality, richannotated, and spanning multiple occurrences in the field of image recognition, including near-duplications, occlusions, and appearance changes. In addition, we provide two types of annotations for cartoon media, i.e., face recognition, and face detection, with the help of a semi-automatic labeling algorithm. To further investigate this challenging dataset, we propose a multi-task domain adaptation approach that jointly utilizes the human and cartoon domain knowledge with three discriminative regularizations. We hence perform a benchmark analysis of the proposed dataset and verify the superiority of the proposed approach in the cartoon face recognition task. We believe this public availability will attract more research attention in broad practical application scenarios.</p></details> | 9 papers, 6 figures | None |
| **[A survey of face recognition techniques under occlusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11366v1)** | 2020-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limited capacity to recognize faces under occlusions is a long-standing problem that presents a unique challenge for face recognition systems and even for humans. The problem regarding occlusion is less covered by research when compared to other challenges such as pose variation, different expressions, etc. Nevertheless, occluded face recognition is imperative to exploit the full potential of face recognition for real-world applications. In this paper, we restrict the scope to occluded face recognition. First, we explore what the occlusion problem is and what inherent difficulties can arise. As a part of this review, we introduce face detection under occlusion, a preliminary step in face recognition. Second, we present how existing face recognition methods cope with the occlusion problem and classify them into three categories, which are 1) occlusion robust feature extraction approaches, 2) occlusion aware face recognition approaches, and 3) occlusion recovery based face recognition approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the motivations, innovations, pros and cons, and the performance of representative approaches for comparison. Finally, future challenges and method trends of occluded face recognition are thoroughly discussed.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Methodology for Building Synthetic Datasets with Virtual Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11757v1)** | 2020-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning methods have increased the performance of face detection and recognition systems. The accuracy of these models relies on the range of variation provided in the training data. Creating a dataset that represents all variations of real-world faces is not feasible as the control over the quality of the data decreases with the size of the dataset. Repeatability of data is another challenge as it is not possible to exactly recreate 'real-world' acquisition conditions outside of the laboratory. In this work, we explore a framework to synthetically generate facial data to be used as part of a toolchain to generate very large facial datasets with a high degree of control over facial and environmental variations. Such large datasets can be used for improved, targeted training of deep neural networks. In particular, we make use of a 3D morphable face model for the rendering of multiple 2D images across a dataset of 100 synthetic identities, providing full control over image variations such as pose, illumination, and background.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference - ISSC 2020</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-spectral Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05196v1)** | 2020-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermal face image analysis is favorable for certain circumstances. For example, illumination-sensitive applications, like nighttime surveillance; and privacy-preserving demanded access control. However, the inadequate study on thermal face image analysis calls for attention in responding to the industry requirements. Detecting facial landmark points are important for many face analysis tasks, such as face recognition, 3D face reconstruction, and face expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a robust neural network enabled facial landmark detection, namely Deep Multi-Spectral Learning (DMSL). Briefly, DMSL consists of two sub-models, i.e. face boundary detection, and landmark coordinates detection. Such an architecture demonstrates the capability of detecting the facial landmarks on both visible and thermal images. Particularly, the proposed DMSL model is robust in facial landmark detection where the face is partially occluded, or facing different directions. The experiment conducted on Eurecom's visible and thermal paired database shows the superior performance of DMSL over the state-of-the-art for thermal facial landmark detection. In addition to that, we have annotated a thermal face dataset with their respective facial landmark for the purpose of experimentation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we are introducing a smart and efficient system for attendance using face detection and face recognition. This system can be used to take attendance in colleges or offices using real-time face recognition with the help of the Convolution Neural Network(CNN). The conventional methods like Eigenfaces and Fisher faces are sensitive to lighting, noise, posture, obstruction, illumination etc. Hence, we have used CNN to recognize the face and overcome such difficulties. The attendance records will be updated automatically and stored in an excel sheet as well as in a database. We have used MongoDB as a backend database for attendance records.</p></details> | 4 Pages, 9 Figures | None |

Naturally, this means users who wish to avoid automatic recognition are becoming less able to do so. Where do we stand in this cat-and-mouse race? We currently live in a society where everyone carries a camera in their pocket. Many people willfully upload most or all of the pictures they take to social networks which invest heavily in automatic face recognition systems. In this setting, is it still possible for privacy-conscientious users to avoid automatic face detection and recognition? If so, how? Must evasion techniques be obvious to be effective, or are there still simple measures that users can use to protect themselves? In this work, we find ways to evade face detection on Facebook, a representative example of a popular social network that uses automatic face detection to enhance their service. We challenge widely-held beliefs about evading face detection: do our old techniques such as blurring the face region or wearing "privacy glasses" still work? We show that in general, state-of-the-art detectors can often find faces even if the subject wears occluding clothing or even if the uploader damages the photo to prevent faces from being detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at WACV 2016</p></details> | None |

Most of these datasets are acquired from webpages with automatic procedures. As a consequence, noisy data are often found. Furthermore, in these large face datasets, the annotation of identities is important as they are used for training face recognition algorithms. But due to the automatic way of gathering these datasets and due to their large size, many identities folder contain mislabeled samples which deteriorates the quality of the datasets. In this work, it is presented a semi-automatic method for cleaning the noisy large face datasets with the use of face recognition. This methodology is applied to clean the CelebA dataset and show its effectiveness. Furthermore, the list with the mislabelled samples in the CelebA dataset is made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>2020 ...</summary><p>2020 Twelfth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)</p></details> | None |
| **[Masked Face Recognition Dataset and Application](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09093v2)** | 2020-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus, almost everyone wears a mask during coronavirus epidemic. This almost makes conventional facial recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access control, face access control, facial attendance, facial security checks at train stations, etc. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the recognition performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces. Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present, there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end, this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95% accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry. Our datasets are available at: https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset) |

In recent years, with the development of deep learning, the field of pattern recognition has made great development. This paper designs a real-time fatigue state recognition algorithm based on spatio-temporal feature sequence, which can be mainly applied to the scene of fatigue driving recognition. The algorithm is divided into three task networks: face detection network, facial landmark detection and head pose estimation network, fatigue recognition network. Experiments show that the algorithm has the advantages of small volume, high speed and high accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

It can be visualized as a network of connected things which is capable of providing intelligent services. This paper presents an IoT based security surveillance system in buildings using Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SBC) and NodeMCU (WiFi/IoT module). This system comprises of wireless sensor nodes and a controller section for surveillance. Intrusion detection with face detection and recognition, fire detection, remote user alerts, live video streaming and portability are the prime features of the system. The use of face recognition feature in intrusion detection makes the system more efficient by identifying the known and unknown person in restricted areas. WiFi module processes the sensor based events and sends the sensor status to controller section. Upon receiving the event notification, the controller enables the camera for capturing the event, alerts the user via email, phone call and Short Message Service (SMS) and places the live video of event on webpage. The use of WiFi module makes the node compact, cost effective and easy to use. The biggest advantage of the system is that the user can seek surveillance from anywhere in the world and can respond according to the situations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiple Face Analyses through Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07846v1)** | 2019-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This inherent relations among multiple face analysis tasks, such as landmark detection, head pose estimation, gender recognition and face attribute estimation are crucial to boost the performance of each task, but have not been thoroughly explored since typically these multiple face analysis tasks are handled as separate tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel deep multi-task adversarial learning method to localize facial landmark, estimate head pose and recognize gender jointly or estimate multiple face attributes simultaneously through exploring their dependencies from both image representation-level and label-level. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a deep recognition network R and a discriminator D. The deep recognition network is used to learn the shared middle-level image representation and conducts multiple face analysis tasks simultaneously. Through multi-task learning mechanism, the recognition network explores the dependencies among multiple face analysis tasks, such as facial landmark localization, head pose estimation, gender recognition and face attribute estimation from image representation-level. The discriminator is introduced to enforce the distribution of the multiple face analysis tasks to converge to that inherent in the ground-truth labels. During training, the recognizer tries to confuse the discriminator, while the discriminator competes with the recognizer through distinguishing the predicted label combination from the ground-truth one. Though adversarial learning, we explore the dependencies among multiple face analysis tasks from label-level. Experimental results on four benchmark databases, i.e., the AFLW database, the Multi-PIE database, the CelebA database and the LFWA database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for multiple face analyses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Face Detection on Surveillance Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11121v1)** | 2019-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In last few decades, a lot of progress has been made in the field of face detection. Various face detection methods have been proposed by numerous researchers working in this area. The two well-known benchmarking platform: the FDDB and WIDER face detection provide quite challenging scenarios to assess the efficacy of the detection methods. These benchmarking data sets are mostly created using images from the public network ie. the Internet. A recent, face detection and open-set recognition challenge has shown that those same face detection algorithms produce high false alarms for images taken in surveillance scenario. This shows the difficult nature of the surveillance environment. Our proposed body pose based face detection method was one of the top performers in this competition. In this paper, we perform a comparative performance analysis of some of the well known face detection methods including the few used in that competition, and, compare them to our proposed body pose based face detection method. Experiment results show that, our proposed method that leverages body information to detect faces, is the most realistic approach in terms of accuracy, false alarms and average detection time, when surveillance scenario is in consideration.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[Vulnerability of Face Recognition to Deep Morphing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01933v1)** | 2019-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is increasingly easy to automatically swap faces in images and video or morph two faces into one using generative adversarial networks (GANs). The high quality of the resulted deep-morph raises the question of how vulnerable the current face recognition systems are to such fake images and videos. It also calls for automated ways to detect these GAN-generated faces. In this paper, we present the publicly available dataset of the Deepfake videos with faces morphed with a GAN-based algorithm. To generate these videos, we used open source software based on GANs, and we emphasize that training and blending parameters can significantly impact the quality of the resulted videos. We show that the state of the art face recognition systems based on VGG and Facenet neural networks are vulnerable to the deep morph videos, with 85.62 and 95.00 false acceptance rates, respectively, which means methods for detecting these videos are necessary. We consider several baseline approaches for detecting deep morphs and find that the method based on visual quality metrics (often used in presentation attack detection domain) leads to the best performance with 8.97 equal error rate. Our experiments demonstrate that GAN-generated deep morph videos are challenging for both face recognition systems and existing detection methods, and the further development of deep morphing technologies will make it even more so.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1812.08685</p></details> | None |

Commonly, research on automatic recognition of emotions is, with few exceptions, limited to one modality. We describe an in-car experiment for emotion recognition from speech interactions for three modalities: the audio signal of a spoken interaction, the visual signal of the driver's face, and the manually transcribed content of utterances of the driver. We use off-the-shelf tools for emotion detection in audio and face and compare that to a neural transfer learning approach for emotion recognition from text which utilizes existing resources from other domains. We see that transfer learning enables models based on out-of-domain corpora to perform well. This method contributes up to 10 percentage points in F1, with up to 76 micro-average F1 across the emotions joy, annoyance and insecurity. Our findings also indicate that off-the-shelf-tools analyzing face and audio are not ready yet for emotion detection in in-car speech interactions without further adjustments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, accepted at KONVENS 2019</p></details> | None |
| **[An Automatic System for Unconstrained Video-Based Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04058v3)** | 2019-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning approaches have achieved performance surpassing humans for still image-based face recognition, unconstrained video-based face recognition is still a challenging task due to large volume of data to be processed and intra/inter-video variations on pose, illumination, occlusion, scene, blur, video quality, etc. In this work, we consider challenging scenarios for unconstrained video-based face recognition from multiple-shot videos and surveillance videos with low-quality frames. To handle these problems, we propose a robust and efficient system for unconstrained video-based face recognition, which is composed of modules for face/fiducial detection, face association, and face recognition. First, we use multi-scale single-shot face detectors to efficiently localize faces in videos. The detected faces are then grouped respectively through carefully designed face association methods, especially for multi-shot videos. Finally, the faces are recognized by the proposed face matcher based on an unsupervised subspace learning approach and a subspace-to-subspace similarity metric. Extensive experiments on challenging video datasets, such as Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge (MBGC), Face and Ocular Challenge Series (FOCS), IARPA Janus Surveillance Video Benchmark (IJB-S) for low-quality surveillance videos and IARPA JANUS Benchmark B (IJB-B) for multiple-shot videos, demonstrate that the proposed system can accurately detect and associate faces from unconstrained videos and effectively learn robust and discriminative features for recognition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Can Synthetic Faces Undo the Damage of Dataset Bias to Face Recognition and Facial Landmark Detection?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08565v2)** | 2019-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that deep learning approaches to face recognition and facial landmark detection suffer from biases in modern training datasets. In this work, we propose to use synthetic face images to reduce the negative effects of dataset biases on these tasks. Using a 3D morphable face model, we generate large amounts of synthetic face images with full control over facial shape and color, pose, illumination, and background. With a series of experiments, we extensively test the effects of priming deep nets by pre-training them with synthetic faces. We observe the following positive effects for face recognition and facial landmark detection tasks: 1) Priming with synthetic face images improves the performance consistently across all benchmarks because it reduces the negative effects of biases in the training data. 2) Traditional approaches for reducing the damage of dataset bias, such as data augmentation and transfer learning, are less effective than training with synthetic faces. 3) Using synthetic data, we can reduce the size of real-world datasets by 75% for face recognition and by 50% for facial landmark detection while maintaining performance. Thus, offering a means to focus the data collection process on less but higher quality data.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[Diversity in Faces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10436v6)** | 2019-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition is a long standing challenge in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The goal is to create systems that accurately detect, recognize, verify, and understand human faces. There are significant technical hurdles in making these systems accurate, particularly in unconstrained settings due to confounding factors related to pose, resolution, illumination, occlusion, and viewpoint. However, with recent advances in neural networks, face recognition has achieved unprecedented accuracy, largely built on data-driven deep learning methods. While this is encouraging, a critical aspect that is limiting facial recognition accuracy and fairness is inherent facial diversity. Every face is different. Every face reflects something unique about us. Aspects of our heritage - including race, ethnicity, culture, geography - and our individual identify - age, gender, and other visible manifestations of self-expression, are reflected in our faces. We expect face recognition to work equally accurately for every face. Face recognition needs to be fair. As we rely on data-driven methods to create face recognition technology, we need to ensure necessary balance and coverage in training data. However, there are still scientific questions about how to represent and extract pertinent facial features and quantitatively measure facial diversity. Towards this goal, Diversity in Faces (DiF) provides a data set of one million annotated human face images for advancing the study of facial diversity. The annotations are generated using ten well-established facial coding schemes from the scientific literature. The facial coding schemes provide human-interpretable quantitative measures of facial features. We believe that by making the extracted coding schemes available on a large set of faces, we can accelerate research and development towards creating more fair and accurate facial recognition systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated statistics after slight modification to dataset due to inactive links and deletions</p></details> | None |
| **[Anchor Cascade for Efficient Face Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03363v1)** | 2019-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face detection is essential to facial analysis tasks such as facial reenactment and face recognition. Both cascade face detectors and anchor-based face detectors have translated shining demos into practice and received intensive attention from the community. However, cascade face detectors often suffer from a low detection accuracy, while anchor-based face detectors rely heavily on very large networks pre-trained on large scale image classification datasets such as ImageNet [1], which is not computationally efficient for both training and deployment. In this paper, we devise an efficient anchor-based cascade framework called anchor cascade. To improve the detection accuracy by exploring contextual information, we further propose a context pyramid maxout mechanism for anchor cascade. As a result, anchor cascade can train very efficient face detection models with a high detection accuracy. Specifically, comparing with a popular CNN-based cascade face detector MTCNN [2], our anchor cascade face detector greatly improves the detection accuracy, e.g., from 0.9435 to 0.9704 at 1k false positives on FDDB, while it still runs in comparable speed. Experimental results on two widely used face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER FACE, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Firstly, this paper utilizes pre-processing and a landmark detection method in order to find the important landmarks of faces. Thereafter, four different frameworks are proposed which are inspired by state-of-the-art gender recognition systems. The first framework extracts features using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and uses back propagation neural network. The second framework uses Gabor filters, PCA, and kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). The third framework uses lower part of faces as input and classifies them using kernel SVM. The fourth framework uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in order to classify the side outline landmarks of faces. Finally, the four decisions of frameworks are fused using weighted voting. This paper takes advantage of both texture and geometrical information, the two dominant types of information in facial gender recognition. Experimental results show the power and effectiveness of the proposed method. This method obtains recognition rate of 94% for neutral faces of FEI face dataset, which is equal to state-of-the-art rate for this dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, key words: gender recognition, Gabor filter, local binary pattern, lower face, LDA, SVM, back propagation neural network, PCA</p></details> | None |

Although a few face morphing detection methods have been put forward, the face morphing accomplice's facial restoration remains a challenging problem. In this paper, a face de-morphing generative adversarial network (FD-GAN) is proposed to restore the accomplice's facial image. It utilizes a symmetric dual network architecture and two levels of restoration losses to separate the identity feature of the morphing accomplice. By exploiting the captured facial image (containing the criminal's identity) from the face recognition system and the morphed image stored in the e-passport system (containing both criminal and accomplice's identities), the FD-GAN can effectively restore the accomplice's facial image. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. It has great potential to be implemented for detecting the face morphing accomplice in a real identity verification scenario.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |

In unconstrained settings it is still an open challenge because of the variation in pose, lighting, scale, background and location. However, for the purposes of verification we can have a control on background and location. Images are primarily captured in places such as the entrance to a sensitive building, in front of a door or some location where the background does not change. We present a correlation based face detection algorithm to detect faces in such settings, where we control the location, and leave lighting, pose, and scale uncontrolled. In these scenarios the results indicate that our algorithm is easy and fast to train, outperforms Viola and Jones face detection accuracy and is faster to test.</p></details> | 14 pages, 21 figures | None |
| **[Face Liveness Detection Based on Client Identity Using Siamese Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05369v1)** | 2019-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face liveness detection is an essential prerequisite for face recognition applications. Previous face liveness detection methods usually train a binary classifier to differentiate between a fake face and a real face before face recognition. The client identity information is not utilized in previous face liveness detection methods. However, in practical face recognition applications, face spoofing attacks are always aimed at a specific client, and the client identity information can provide useful clues for face liveness detection. In this paper, we propose a face liveness detection method based on the client identity using Siamese network. We detect face liveness after face recognition instead of before face recognition, that is, we detect face liveness with the client identity information. We train a Siamese network with image pairs. Each image pair consists of two real face images or one real and one fake face images. The face images in each pair come from a same client. Given a test face image, the face image is firstly recognized by face recognition system, then the real face image of the identified client is retrieved to help the face liveness detection. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

It is well established that the state-of-the-art methods in face recognition provide low accuracy in the case of poor illumination. In this work, we propose an algorithm for a more robust illumination invariant face recognition using a multi-modal approach. We propose a new dataset consisting of aligned faces of thermal and visual images of a hundred subjects. We then apply face detection on thermal images using the biggest blob extraction method and apply them for fusing images of different modalities for the purpose of face recognition. An algorithm is proposed to implement fusion of thermal and visual images. We reason for why relying on only one modality can give erroneous results. We use a lighter and faster CNN model called MobileNet for the purpose of face recognition with faster inferencing and to be able to be use it in real time biometric systems. We test our proposed method on our own created dataset to show that real-time face recognition on fused images shows far better results than using visual or thermal images separately.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Registration-free Face-SSD: Single shot analysis of smiles, facial attributes, and affect in the wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04042v1)** | 2019-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel single shot face-related task analysis method, called Face-SSD, for detecting faces and for performing various face-related (classification/regression) tasks including smile recognition, face attribute prediction and valence-arousal estimation in the wild. Face-SSD uses a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) to detect multiple faces of different sizes and recognise/regress one or more face-related classes. Face-SSD has two parallel branches that share the same low-level filters, one branch dealing with face detection and the other one with face analysis tasks. The outputs of both branches are spatially aligned heatmaps that are produced in parallel - therefore Face-SSD does not require that face detection, facial region extraction, size normalisation, and facial region processing are performed in subsequent steps. Our contributions are threefold: 1) Face-SSD is the first network to perform face analysis without relying on pre-processing such as face detection and registration in advance - Face-SSD is a simple and a single FCNN architecture simultaneously performing face detection and face-related task analysis - those are conventionally treated as separate consecutive tasks; 2) Face-SSD is a generalised architecture that is applicable for various face analysis tasks without modifying the network structure - this is in contrast to designing task-specific architectures; and 3) Face-SSD achieves real-time performance (21 FPS) even when detecting multiple faces and recognising multiple classes in a given image. Experimental results show that Face-SSD achieves state-of-the-art performance in various face analysis tasks by reaching a recognition accuracy of 95.76% for smile detection, 90.29% for attribute prediction, and Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.44 and 0.39 for valence and arousal estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted for Elsevier CVIU 2019</p></details> | None |

In the third step, a feature extraction algorithm based on the surface normals of Gabor-wavelet filtered depth maps is utilised and, then, a set of spherical patches and curves are localised over the nasal region to provide the feature descriptors. The last step applies a genetic algorithm-based feature selector to detect the most stable patches and curves over different facial expressions. The algorithm provides the highest reported nasal region-based recognition ranks on the FRGC, Bosphorus and BU-3DFE datasets. The results are comparable with, and in many cases better than, many state-of-the-art 3D face recognition algorithms, which use the whole facial domain. The proposed method does not rely on sophisticated alignment or denoising steps, is very robust when only one sample per subject is used in the gallery, and does not require a training step for the landmarking algorithm. https://github.com/mehryaragha/NoseBiometrics</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/mehryaragha/NoseBiometrics) |

Assessment and Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08685v1)** | 2018-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is becoming increasingly easy to automatically replace a face of one person in a video with the face of another person by using a pre-trained generative adversarial network (GAN). Recent public scandals, e.g., the faces of celebrities being swapped onto pornographic videos, call for automated ways to detect these Deepfake videos. To help developing such methods, in this paper, we present the first publicly available set of Deepfake videos generated from videos of VidTIMIT database. We used open source software based on GANs to create the Deepfakes, and we emphasize that training and blending parameters can significantly impact the quality of the resulted videos. To demonstrate this impact, we generated videos with low and high visual quality (320 videos each) using differently tuned parameter sets. We showed that the state of the art face recognition systems based on VGG and Facenet neural networks are vulnerable to Deepfake videos, with 85.62% and 95.00% false acceptance rates respectively, which means methods for detecting Deepfake videos are necessary. By considering several baseline approaches, we found that audio-visual approach based on lip-sync inconsistency detection was not able to distinguish Deepfake videos. The best performing method, which is based on visual quality metrics and is often used in presentation attack detection domain, resulted in 8.97% equal error rate on high quality Deepfakes. Our experiments demonstrate that GAN-generated Deepfake videos are challenging for both face recognition systems and existing detection methods, and the further development of face swapping technology will make it even more so.</p></details> | <details><summary>http:...</summary><p>http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/3988</p></details> | None |

| **[The Intelligent ICU Pilot Study: Using Artificial Intelligence Technology for Autonomous Patient Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10201v2)** | 2018-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, many critical care indices are repetitively assessed and recorded by overburdened nurses, e.g. physical function or facial pain expressions of nonverbal patients. In addition, many essential information on patients and their environment are not captured at all, or are captured in a non-granular manner, e.g. sleep disturbance factors such as bright light, loud background noise, or excessive visitations. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of using pervasive sensing technology and artificial intelligence for autonomous and granular monitoring of critically ill patients and their environment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As an exemplar prevalent condition, we also characterized delirious and non-delirious patients and their environment. We used wearable sensors, light and sound sensors, and a high-resolution camera to collected data on patients and their environment. We analyzed collected data using deep learning and statistical analysis. Our system performed face detection, face recognition, facial action unit detection, head pose detection, facial expression recognition, posture recognition, actigraphy analysis, sound pressure and light level detection, and visitation frequency detection. We were able to detect patient's face (Mean average precision (mAP)=0.94), recognize patient's face (mAP=0.80), and their postures (F1=0.94). We also found that all facial expressions, 11 activity features, visitation frequency during the day, visitation frequency during the night, light levels, and sound pressure levels during the night were significantly different between delirious and non-delirious patients (p-value<0.05). In summary, we showed that granular and autonomous monitoring of critically ill patients and their environment is feasible and can be used for characterizing critical care conditions and related environment factors.</p></details> |  | None |

However, although the performance gap appears to be narrowing in terms of accuracy-based expectations, a curious question has arisen; specifically, "Face understanding of AI is really close to that of human?" In the present study, in an effort to confirm the brain-driven concept, we conduct image-based detection, classification, and generation using an in-house created fake face database. This database has two configurations: (i) false positive face detections produced using both the Viola Jones (VJ) method and convolutional neural networks (CNN), and (ii) simulacra that have fundamental characteristics that resemble faces but are completely artificial. The results show a level of suggestive knowledge that indicates the continuing existence of a gap between the capabilities of recent vision-based face recognition algorithms and human-level performance. On a positive note, however, we have obtained knowledge that will advance the progress of face-understanding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, ECCV 2018 Workshop on Brain-Driven Computer Vision (BDCV)</p></details> | None |

The challenge presented in this paper addresses the next step in the direction of automatic detection and identification of people from outdoor surveillance cameras. While face detection has shown remarkable success in images collected from the web, surveillance cameras include more diverse occlusions, poses, weather conditions and image blur. Although face verification or closed-set face identification have surpassed human capabilities on some datasets, open-set identification is much more complex as it needs to reject both unknown identities and false accepts from the face detector. We show that unconstrained face detection can approach high detection rates albeit with moderate false accept rates. By contrast, open-set face recognition is currently weak and requires much more attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an ERRATA version of the paper originally presented at the International Joint Conference on Biometrics.

These, along with a better understanding of deep learning methods, have also led to improved capabilities of machine understanding of faces. CNNs are able to detect faces, locate facial landmarks, estimate pose, and recognize faces in unconstrained images and videos. In this paper, we describe the details of a deep learning pipeline for unconstrained face identification and verification which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We propose a novel face detector, Deep Pyramid Single Shot Face Detector (DPSSD), which is fast and capable of detecting faces with large scale variations (especially tiny faces). We give design details of the various modules involved in automatic face recognition: face detection, landmark localization and alignment, and face identification/verification. We provide evaluation results of the proposed face detector on challenging unconstrained face detection datasets. Then, we present experimental results for IARPA Janus Benchmarks A, B and C (IJB-A, IJB-B, IJB-C), and the Janus Challenge Set 5 (CS5).</p></details> |  | None |

Our work studies and extends multiple frameworks for the aforementioned tasks. For face detection, we incorporate the Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) architecture and contrast it with conventional methods. For face recognition, our two-fold contributions include: (i) an inductive transfer learning approach combining the feature learning capability of the Inception v3 network and the feature recognizing capability of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), (ii) a proposed Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) framework trained over a fusion of pixel values and 15 manually located facial keypoints. All the methods are evaluated on the Cartoon Faces in the Wild (IIIT-CFW) database. We demonstrate that the HCNN model offers stability superior to that of Inception+SVM over larger input variations, and explore the plausible architectural principles. We show that the Inception+SVM model establishes a state-of-the-art F1 score on the task of gender recognition of cartoon faces. Further, we introduce a small database hosting location coordinates of 15 points on the cartoon faces belonging to 50 public figures of the IIIT-CFW database.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

We describe our video analytics system comprising of Search, Summarize, Statistics and real-time alerting, and outline its building blocks. These building blocks include object detection, tracking, face detection and recognition, human and face sub-attribute analytics. In each case, we demonstrate how custom models trained using data from the deployment scenarios provide considerably superior accuracies than off-the-shelf models. Towards this end, we describe our data processing and model training pipeline, which can train and fine-tune models from videos with a quick turnaround time. Finally, since most of these models are deployed on-site, it is important to have resource constrained models which do not require GPUs. We demonstrate how we custom train resource constrained models and deploy them on embedded devices without significant loss in accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work which provides a comprehensive evaluation of different deep learning models on various real-world customer deployment scenarios of surveillance video analytics. By sharing our implementation details and the experiences learned from deploying customized deep learning models for various customers, we hope that customized deep learning based video analytics is widely incorporated in commercial products around the world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Equal Contribution footnote</p></details> | None |

Although face recognition is probably the most widely researched, many other tasks such as kinship detection, facial expression classification and facial aging have been examined. In this work we propose the new, subjective task of quantifying perceived face similarity between a pair of faces. That is, we predict the perceived similarity between facial images, given that they are not of the same person. Although this task is clearly correlated with face recognition, it is different and therefore justifies a separate investigation. Humans often remark that two persons look alike, even in cases where the persons are not actually confused with one another. In addition, because face similarity is different than traditional image similarity, there are challenges in data collection and labeling, and dealing with diverging subjective opinions between human labelers. We present evidence that finding facial look-alikes and recognizing faces are two distinct tasks. We propose a new dataset for facial similarity and introduce the Lookalike network, directed towards similar face classification, which outperforms the ad hoc usage of a face recognition network directed at the same task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 1st CVPR Workshop on Visual Understanding of Subjective Attributes of Data 2018</p></details> | None |

Despite such advances, existing datasets do not capture the difficulty of face recognition in the wildest scenarios, such as hostile disputes or fights. Furthermore, existing datasets do not represent completely unconstrained cases of low resolution, high blur and large pose/occlusion variances. To this end, we introduce the Wildest Faces dataset, which focuses on such adverse effects through violent scenes. The dataset consists of an extensive set of violent scenes of celebrities from movies. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art techniques are not well-suited for violent scenes, and therefore, Wildest Faces is likely to stir further interest in face detection and recognition research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to BMVC 2018</p></details> | None |

Not only is face detection an important pre-processing step in computer vision applications but also in computational psychology, behavioral imaging and other fields where researchers might not be initiated in computer vision frameworks and state-of-the-art detection applications. A large part of existing research that includes face detection as a pre-processing step uses existing out-of-the-box detectors such as the HoG-based dlib and the OpenCV Haar face detector which are no longer state-of-the-art - they are primarily used because of their ease of use and accessibility. We introduce Dockerface, a very accurate Faster R-CNN face detector in a Docker container which requires no training and is easy to install and use.</p></details> |  | None |

Many traditional studies have identified that frequent interactions with pets could make individuals become healthier and more optimistic, and ultimately enjoy a happier life. However, most of those studies are not only restricted in scale, but also may carry biases by using subjective self-reports, interviews, and questionnaires as the major approaches. In this paper, we leverage large-scale data collected from social media and the state-of-the-art deep learning technologies to study this phenomenon in depth and breadth. Our study includes four major steps: 1) collecting timeline posts from around 20,000 Instagram users, 2) using face detection and recognition on 2-million photos to infer users' demographics, relationship status, and whether having children, 3) analyzing a user's degree of happiness based on images and captions via smiling classification and textual sentiment analysis, 3) applying transfer learning techniques to retrain the final layer of the Inception v3 model for pet classification, and 4) analyzing the effects of pets on happiness in terms of multiple factors of user demographics. Our main results have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed method with many new insights. We believe this method is also applicable to other domains as a scalable, efficient, and effective methodology for modeling and analyzing social behaviors and psychological well-being. In addition, to facilitate the research involving human faces, we also release our dataset of 700K analyzed faces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Xuefe...</summary><p>Xuefeng Peng, Li-Kai Chi, and Jiebo Luo. 2017.

We propose a new synthesis method to enhance the discriminative quality of synthesized visible face imagery by leveraging both global (e.g., entire face) and local regions (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth). Here, each region provides (1) an independent representation for the corresponding area, and (2) additional regularization terms, which impact the overall quality of synthesized images. We analyze the effects of using multiple regions to synthesize a visible face image from a thermal face. We demonstrate that our approach improves cross-spectrum verification rates over recently published synthesis approaches. Moreover, using our synthesized imagery, we report the results on facial landmark detection-commonly used for image registration-which is a critical part of the face recognition process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted IEEE WACV 2018, received best paper award</p></details> | None |

However, they are essentially a black box method since it is not easy to mathematically formulate the functions that are learned within its many layers of representation. Realizing this, many researchers have started to design methods to exploit the drawbacks of deep learning based algorithms questioning their robustness and exposing their singularities. In this paper, we attempt to unravel three aspects related to the robustness of DNNs for face recognition: (i) assessing the impact of deep architectures for face recognition in terms of vulnerabilities to attacks inspired by commonly observed distortions in the real world that are well handled by shallow learning methods along with learning based adversaries; (ii) detecting the singularities by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers of deep networks; and (iii) making corrections to the processing pipeline to alleviate the problem. Our experimental evaluation using multiple open-source DNN-based face recognition networks, including OpenFace and VGG-Face, and two publicly available databases (MEDS and PaSC) demonstrates that the performance of deep learning based face recognition algorithms can suffer greatly in the presence of such distortions. The proposed method is also compared with existing detection algorithms and the results show that it is able to detect the attacks with very high accuracy by suitably designing a classifier using the response of the hidden layers in the network. Finally, we present several effective countermeasures to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks and improve the overall robustness of DNN-based face recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2018 (8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables)</p></details> | None |

As one of the most informative expressions, smiles convey basic underlying emotions, such as happiness and satisfaction, which lead to multiple applications, e.g., human behavior analysis and interactive controlling. Compared to the size of databases for face recognition, far less labeled data is available for training smile detection systems. To leverage the large amount of labeled data from face recognition datasets and to alleviate overfitting on smile detection, an efficient transfer learning-based smile detection approach is proposed in this paper. Unlike previous works which use either hand-engineered features or train deep convolutional networks from scratch, a well-trained deep face recognition model is explored and fine-tuned for smile detection in the wild. Three different models are built as a result of fine-tuning the face recognition model with different inputs, including aligned, unaligned and grayscale images generated from the GENKI-4K dataset. Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves improved state-of-the-art performance. Robustness of the model to noise and blur artifacts is also evaluated in this paper.</p></details> |  | None |

However, image quality is a largely ignored issue in traditional pattern recognition literature. In this paper, we use face detection and recognition as case studies to show that image quality is an essential factor which will affect the performances of traditional algorithms. We demonstrated that it is not the image quality itself that is the most important, but rather the quality of the images in the training set should have similar quality as those in the testing set. To handle real-world application scenarios where images with different kinds and severities of degradation can be presented to the system, we have developed a quality classified image analysis framework to deal with images of mixed qualities adaptively. We use deep neural networks first to classify images based on their quality classes and then design a separate face detector and recognizer for images in each quality class. We will present experimental results to show that our quality classified framework can accurately classify images based on the type and severity of image degradations and can significantly boost the performances of state-of-the-art face detector and recognizer in dealing with image datasets containing mixed quality images.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |

It starts from an initial face shape and gradually predicts the face shape update from the local appearance features to generate the facial landmark locations in the next iteration until convergence. In this paper, we improve upon the cascade regression framework and propose the Constrained Joint Cascade Regression Framework (CJCRF) for simultaneous facial action unit recognition and facial landmark detection, which are two related face analysis tasks, but are seldomly exploited together. In particular, we first learn the relationships among facial action units and face shapes as a constraint. Then, in the proposed constrained joint cascade regression framework, with the help from the constraint, we iteratively update the facial landmark locations and the action unit activation probabilities until convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the intertwined relationships of facial action units and face shapes boost the performances of both facial action unit recognition and facial landmark detection.

| **[FacePoseNet: Making a Case for Landmark-Free Face Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07517v2)** | 2017-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained to accurately and robustly regress 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) 3D head pose, directly from image intensities. We further explain how this FacePoseNet (FPN) can be used to align faces in 2D and 3D as an alternative to explicit facial landmark detection for these tasks. We claim that in many cases the standard means of measuring landmark detector accuracy can be misleading when comparing different face alignments. Instead, we compare our FPN with existing methods by evaluating how they affect face recognition accuracy on the IJB-A and IJB-B benchmarks: using the same recognition pipeline, but varying the face alignment method. Our results show that (a) better landmark detection accuracy measured on the 300W benchmark does not necessarily imply better face recognition accuracy. (b) Our FPN provides superior 2D and 3D face alignment on both benchmarks. Finally, (c), FPN aligns faces at a small fraction of the computational cost of comparably accurate landmark detectors. For many purposes, FPN is thus a far faster and far more accurate face alignment method than using facial landmark detectors.</p></details> |  | None |

This has been made possible due to the availability of large annotated datasets, a better understanding of the non-linear mapping between input images and class labels as well as the affordability of GPUs. In this paper, we present the design details of a deep learning system for unconstrained face recognition, including modules for face detection, association, alignment and face verification. The quantitative performance evaluation is conducted using the IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A), the JANUS Challenge Set 2 (JANUS CS2), and the LFW dataset. The IJB-A dataset includes real-world unconstrained faces of 500 subjects with significant pose and illumination variations which are much harder than the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and Youtube Face (YTF) datasets. JANUS CS2 is the extended version of IJB-A which contains not only all the images/frames of IJB-A but also includes the original videos for evaluating the video-based face verification system. Some open issues regarding DCNNs for face verification problems are then discussed.</p></details> | accepted by IJCV | None |

Common face recognition pipeline consists of: 1) face detection, 2) face alignment, 3) feature extraction, 4) similarity calculation, which are separated and independent from each other. The separated face analyzing stages lead the model redundant calculation and are hard for end-to-end training. In this paper, we proposed a novel end-to-end trainable convolutional network framework for face detection and recognition, in which a geometric transformation matrix was directly learned to align the faces, instead of predicting the facial landmarks. In training stage, our single CNN model is supervised only by face bounding boxes and personal identities, which are publicly available from WIDER FACE \cite{Yang2016} dataset and CASIA-WebFace \cite{Yi2014} dataset. Tested on Face Detection Dataset and Benchmark (FDDB) \cite{Jain2010} dataset and Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) \cite{Huang2007} dataset, we have achieved 89.24\% recall for face detection task and 98.63\% verification accuracy for face recognition task simultaneously, which are comparable to state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[A Comprehensive Performance Evaluation of Deformable Face Tracking "In-the-Wild"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06015v2)** | 2017-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, technologies such as face detection, facial landmark localisation and face recognition and verification have matured enough to provide effective and efficient solutions for imagery captured under arbitrary conditions (referred to as "in-the-wild"). This is partially attributed to the fact that comprehensive "in-the-wild" benchmarks have been developed for face detection, landmark localisation and recognition/verification. A very important technology that has not been thoroughly evaluated yet is deformable face tracking "in-the-wild". Until now, the performance has mainly been assessed qualitatively by visually assessing the result of a deformable face tracking technology on short videos. In this paper, we perform the first, to the best of our knowledge, thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art deformable face tracking pipelines using the recently introduced 300VW benchmark. We evaluate many different architectures focusing mainly on the task of on-line deformable face tracking. In particular, we compare the following general strategies: (a) generic face detection plus generic facial landmark localisation, (b) generic model free tracking plus generic facial landmark localisation, as well as (c) hybrid approaches using state-of-the-art face detection, model free tracking and facial landmark localisation technologies. Our evaluation reveals future avenues for further research on the topic.</p></details> | <details><summary>E. An...</summary><p>E. Antonakos and P.

| **[Enhanced Facial Recognition Framework based on Skin Tone and False Alarm Rejection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04377v1)** | 2017-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face detection is one of the challenging tasks in computer vision. Human face detection plays an essential role in the first stage of face processing applications such as face recognition, face tracking, image database management, etc. In these applications, face objects often come from an inconsequential part of images that contain variations, namely different illumination, poses, and occlusion. These variations can decrease face detection rate noticeably. Most existing face detection approaches are not accurate, as they have not been able to resolve unstructured images due to large appearance variations and can only detect human faces under one particular variation. Existing frameworks of face detection need enhancements to detect human faces under the stated variations to improve detection rate and reduce detection time. In this study, an enhanced face detection framework is proposed to improve detection rate based on skin color and provide a validation process. A preliminary segmentation of the input images based on skin color can significantly reduce search space and accelerate the process of human face detection. The primary detection is based on Haar-like features and the Adaboost algorithm. A validation process is introduced to reject non-face objects, which might occur during the face detection process. The validation process is based on two-stage Extended Local Binary Patterns. The experimental results on the CMU-MIT and Caltech 10000 datasets over a wide range of facial variations in different colors, positions, scales, and lighting conditions indicated a successful face detection rate.</p></details> |  | None |

The rampant advent of biometric analysis systems, which may be full body scanners, or iris detection and recognition systems and the finger print recognition systems, and surveillance systems deployed for safety and security purposes have contributed to inclination towards same. Advances has been made with frontal view, lateral view of the face or using facial expressions such as anger, happiness and gloominess, still images and video image to be used for detection and recognition. This led to newer methods for face detection and recognition to be introduced in achieving accurate results and economically feasible and extremely secure. Techniques such as Principal Component analysis (PCA), Independent component analysis (ICA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), have been the predominant ones to be used. But with improvements needed in the previous approaches Neural Networks based recognition was like boon to the industry. It not only enhanced the recognition but also the efficiency of the process.

Similar to the region-based CNNs, our proposed network consists of the region proposal component and the region-of-interest (RoI) detection component. However, far apart of that network, there are two main contributions in our proposed network that play a significant role to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in face detection. Firstly, the multi-scale information is grouped both in region proposal and RoI detection to deal with tiny face regions. Secondly, our proposed network allows explicit body contextual reasoning in the network inspired from the intuition of human vision system. The proposed approach is benchmarked on two recent challenging face detection databases, i.e. the WIDER FACE Dataset which contains high degree of variability, as well as the Face Detection Dataset and Benchmark (FDDB). The experimental results show that our proposed approach trained on WIDER FACE Dataset outperforms strong baselines on WIDER FACE Dataset by a large margin, and consistently achieves competitive results on FDDB against the recent state-of-the-art face detection methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the variations in head-pose that arise naturally in these environments are still a great challenge. In this paper, we present a real-time capable 3D face modelling framework for 2D in-the-wild images that is applicable for robotics. The fitting of the 3D Morphable Model is based exclusively on automatically detected landmarks. After fitting, the face can be corrected in pose and transformed back to a frontal 2D representation that is more suitable for face recognition. We conduct face recognition experiments with non-frontal images from the MUCT database and uncontrolled, in the wild images from the PaSC database, the most challenging face recognition database to date, showing an improved performance. Finally, we present our SCITOS G5 robot system, which incorporates our framework as a means of image pre-processing for face analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

In our representation, a face image is processed by several pose-specific deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to generate multiple pose-specific features. 3D rendering is used to generate multiple face poses from the input image. Sensitivity of the recognition system to pose variations is reduced since we use an ensemble of pose-specific CNN features. The paper presents extensive experimental results on the effect of landmark detection, CNN layer selection and pose model selection on the performance of the recognition pipeline.

The illumination of faces is enhanced by using the state-of-the-art technique which is using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD). After equalization, face images are segmented by use of local Successive Mean Quantization Transform (SMQT) followed by skin color based face detection system. Kullback-Leibler Distance (KLD) between the concatenated PDFs of a given face obtained by LBP and the concatenated PDFs of each face in the database is used as a metric in the recognition process. Various decision fusion techniques have been used in order to improve the recognition rate. The proposed system has been tested on the FERET, HP, and Bosphorus face databases. The proposed system is compared with conventional and thestate-of-the-art techniques. The recognition rates obtained using FVF approach for FERET database is 99.78% compared with 79.60% and 68.80% for conventional gray scale LBP and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) based face recognition techniques respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages in EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing, 2013</p></details> | None |

The system at first takes as input, a 3D range image, simultaneously registers it using ICP(Iterative Closest Point) algorithm. ICP used in this work, registers facial surfaces to a common model by minimizing distances between a probe model and a gallery model. However the performance of ICP relies heavily on the initial conditions. Hence, it is necessary to provide an initial registration, which will be improved iteratively and finally converge to the best alignment possible. Once the faces are registered, the occlusions are automatically extracted by thresholding the depth map values of the 3D image. After the occluded regions are detected, restoration is done by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The restored images, after the removal of occlusions, are then fed to the recognition system for classification purpose. Features are extracted from the reconstructed non-occluded face images in the form of face normals. The experimental results which were obtained on the occluded facial images from the Bosphorus 3D face database, illustrate that our occlusion compensation scheme has attained a recognition accuracy of 91.30%.</p></details> | <details><summary>the p...</summary><p>the paper is of 15 pages, International Journal in Foundations of Computer Science & Technology (IJFCST), Vol.4, No.4, July 2014</p></details> | None |

| **[Can a biologically-plausible hierarchy effectively replace face detection, alignment, and recognition pipelines?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.4082v3)** | 2014-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard approach to unconstrained face recognition in natural photographs is via a detection, alignment, recognition pipeline. While that approach has achieved impressive results, there are several reasons to be dissatisfied with it, among them is its lack of biological plausibility. A recent theory of invariant recognition by feedforward hierarchical networks, like HMAX, other convolutional networks, or possibly the ventral stream, implies an alternative approach to unconstrained face recognition. This approach accomplishes detection and alignment implicitly by storing transformations of training images (called templates) rather than explicitly detecting and aligning faces at test time. Here we propose a particular locality-sensitive hashing based voting scheme which we call "consensus of collisions" and show that it can be used to approximate the full 3-layer hierarchy implied by the theory. The resulting end-to-end system for unconstrained face recognition operates on photographs of faces taken under natural conditions, e.g., Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), without aligning or cropping them, as is normally done. It achieves a drastic improvement in the state of the art on this end-to-end task, reaching the same level of performance as the best systems operating on aligned, closely cropped images (no outside training data). It also performs well on two newer datasets, similar to LFW, but more difficult: LFW-jittered (new here) and SUFR-W.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, 4 Figures.

| **[Skin Texture Recognition Using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6049v1)** | 2013-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skin recognition is used in many applications ranging from algorithms for face detection, hand gesture analysis, and to objectionable image filtering. In this work a skin recognition system was developed and tested. While many skin segmentation algorithms relay on skin color, our work relies on both skin color and texture features (features derives from the GLCM) to give a better and more efficient recognition accuracy of skin textures. We used feed forward neural networks to classify input textures images to be skin or non skin textures. The system gave very encouraging results during the neural network generalization face.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 figures, conference ACIT 2008, Tunisia</p></details> | None |
| **[Skin Segmentation based Elastic Bunch Graph Matching for efficient multiple Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.6066v1)** | 2013-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is aimed at developing and combining different algorithms for face detection and face recognition to generate an efficient mechanism that can detect and recognize the facial regions of input image. For the detection of face from complex region, skin segmentation isolates the face-like regions in a complex image and following operations of morphology and template matching rejects false matches to extract facial region. For the recognition of the face, the image database is now converted into a database of facial segments. Hence, implementing the technique of Elastic Bunch Graph matching (EBGM) after skin segmentation generates Face Bunch Graphs that acutely represents the features of an individual face enhances the quality of the training set. This increases the matching probability significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages Advances in Computer Science, Engineering Applications, May, 2012</p></details> | None |
| **[Dynamic Amelioration of Resolution Mismatches for Local Feature Based Identity Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2133v1)** | 2013-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While existing face recognition systems based on local features are robust to issues such as misalignment, they can exhibit accuracy degradation when comparing images of differing resolutions. This is common in surveillance environments where a gallery of high resolution mugshots is compared to low resolution CCTV probe images, or where the size of a given image is not a reliable indicator of the underlying resolution (eg. poor optics). To alleviate this degradation, we propose a compensation framework which dynamically chooses the most appropriate face recognition system for a given pair of image resolutions. This framework applies a novel resolution detection method which does not rely on the size of the input images, but instead exploits the sensitivity of local features to resolution using a probabilistic multi-region histogram approach. Experiments on a resolution-modified version of the "Labeled Faces in the Wild" dataset show that the proposed resolution detector frontend obtains a 99% average accuracy in selecting the most appropriate face recognition system, resulting in higher overall face discrimination accuracy (across several resolutions) compared to the individual baseline face recognition systems.</p></details> |  | None |
