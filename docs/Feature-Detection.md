| **[Reassessing feature-based Android malware detection in a contemporary context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12778v4)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the findings of a reimplementation of 18 foundational studies in feature-based machine learning for Android malware detection, published during the period 2013-2023. These studies are reevaluated on a level playing field using a contemporary Android environment and a balanced dataset of 124,000 applications. Our findings show that feature-based approaches can still achieve detection accuracies beyond 98%, despite a considerable increase in the size of the underlying Android feature sets. We observe that features derived through dynamic analysis yield only a small benefit over those derived from static analysis, and that simpler models often out-perform more complex models. We also find that API calls and opcodes are the most productive static features within our evaluation context, network traffic is the most predictive dynamic feature, and that ensemble models provide an efficient means of combining models trained on static and dynamic features. Together, these findings suggest that simple, fast machine learning approaches can still be an effective basis for malware detection, despite the increasing focus on slower, more expensive machine learning models in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Network Anomaly Traffic Detection via Multi-view Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08020v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional anomalous traffic detection methods are based on single-view analysis, which has obvious limitations in dealing with complex attacks and encrypted communications. In this regard, we propose a Multi-view Feature Fusion (MuFF) method for network anomaly traffic detection. MuFF models the temporal and interactive relationships of packets in network traffic based on the temporal and interactive viewpoints respectively. It learns temporal and interactive features. These features are then fused from different perspectives for anomaly traffic detection. Extensive experiments on six real traffic datasets show that MuFF has excellent performance in network anomalous traffic detection, which makes up for the shortcomings of detection under a single perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Ch...</summary><p>in Chinese language, Accepted by Journal of Command and Control. https://www.jc2.org.cn/CN/10.20278/j.jc2.2096-0204.2024.0196</p></details> | None |
| **[Wavelet-Based Feature Extraction and Unsupervised Clustering for Parity Detection: A Feature Engineering Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00071v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores a deliberately over-engineered approach to the classical problem of parity detection -- determining whether a number is odd or even -- by combining wavelet-based feature extraction with unsupervised clustering. Instead of relying on modular arithmetic, integers are transformed into wavelet-domain representations, from which multi-scale statistical features are extracted and clustered using the k-means algorithm. The resulting feature space reveals meaningful structural differences between odd and even numbers, achieving a classification accuracy of approximately 69.67% without any label supervision. These results suggest that classical signal-processing techniques, originally designed for continuous data, can uncover latent structure even in purely discrete symbolic domains. Beyond parity detection, the study provides an illustrative perspective on how feature engineering and clustering may be repurposed for unconventional machine learning problems, potentially bridging symbolic reasoning and feature-based learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Exploring Federated Learning for Thermal Urban Feature Segmentation -- A Comparison of Centralized and Decentralized Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00055v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is an approach for training a shared Machine Learning (ML) model with distributed training data and multiple participants. FL allows bypassing limitations of the traditional Centralized Machine Learning CL if data cannot be shared or stored centrally due to privacy or technical restrictions -- the participants train the model locally with their training data and do not need to share it among the other participants. This paper investigates the practical implementation and effectiveness of FL in a real-world scenario, specifically focusing on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal images for common thermal feature detection in urban environments. The distributed nature of the data arises naturally and makes it suitable for FL applications, as images captured in two German cities are available. This application presents unique challenges due to non-identical distribution and feature characteristics of data captured at both locations. The study makes several key contributions by evaluating FL algorithms in real deployment scenarios rather than simulation. We compare several FL approaches with a centralized learning baseline across key performance metrics such as model accuracy, training time, communication overhead, and energy usage. This paper also explores various FL workflows, comparing client-controlled workflows and server-controlled workflows. The findings of this work serve as a valuable reference for understanding the practical application and limitations of the FL methods in segmentation tasks in UAV-based imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>The V...</summary><p>The Version of Record of this contribution is published in Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA) 2025, and is available online at https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-97000-9</p></details> | None |
| **[A Clinically-Grounded Two-Stage Framework for Renal CT Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23584v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective Renal cancer is a common malignancy and a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Computed tomography (CT) is central to early detection, staging, and treatment planning. However, the growing CT workload increases radiologists' burden and risks incomplete documentation. Automatically generating accurate reports remains challenging because it requires integrating visual interpretation with clinical reasoning. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language and vision-language models, offer potential to reduce workload and enhance diagnostic quality. Methods We propose a clinically informed, two-stage framework for automatic renal CT report generation. In Stage 1, a multi-task learning model detects structured clinical features from each 2D image. In Stage 2, a vision-language model generates free-text reports conditioned on the image and the detected features. To evaluate clinical fidelity, generated clinical features are extracted from the reports and compared with expert-annotated ground truth. Results Experiments on an expert-labeled dataset show that incorporating detected features improves both report quality and clinical accuracy. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.75 for key imaging features and a METEOR score of 0.33, demonstrating higher clinical consistency and fewer template-driven errors. Conclusion Linking structured feature detection with conditioned report generation provides a clinically grounded approach to integrate structured prediction and narrative drafting for renal CT reporting. This method enhances interpretability and clinical faithfulness, underscoring the value of domain-relevant evaluation metrics for medical AI development.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Local Background Features Matter in Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12259v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the $L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods, with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general, and feature detection and SLAM in particular. On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal). The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM. However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in 2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10414v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks. Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper, we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset, self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate feature matching than the traditional method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lattice-allocated Real-time Line Segment Feature Detection and Tracking Using Only an Event-based Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06829v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints. Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event camera operation in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables, ICCV Workshop NeVi2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient Surgical Robotic Instrument Pose Reconstruction in Real World Conditions Using Unified Feature Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03532v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions; however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging surgical environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection for Large Language Model Generated Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18862v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection, specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD (Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits (0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 tables, empirical study on multi-feature AI text detection</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient and Accurate Downfacing Visual Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10021v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips (SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods, was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24 pixels/frame.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IoT-J)</p></details> | None |
| **[CLAP: Clustering to Localize Across n Possibilities, A Simple, Robust Geometric Approach in the Presence of Symmetries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08495v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024 adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy. However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence and velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing our robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Integrated Detection and Tracking Based on Radar Range-Doppler Feature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06569v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection and tracking are the basic tasks of radar systems. Current joint detection tracking methods, which focus on dynamically adjusting detection thresholds from tracking results, still present challenges in fully utilizing the potential of radar signals. These are mainly reflected in the limited capacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent information, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited information acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and Tracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network architecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection assistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each Range-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the feature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively updates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on detection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by cosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining location and feature information. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method was validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Maximum-likelihood estimation of the Matérn covariance structure of isotropic spatial random fields on finite, sampled grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06223v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a statistically and computationally efficient spectral-domain maximum-likelihood procedure to solve for the structure of Gaussian spatial random fields within the Matern covariance hyperclass. For univariate, stationary, and isotropic fields, the three controlling parameters are the process variance, smoothness, and range. The debiased Whittle likelihood maximization explicitly treats discretization and edge effects for finite sampled regions in parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. As even the best parameter estimate may not be good enough, we provide a test for whether the model specification itself warrants rejection. Our results are practical and relevant for the study of a variety of geophysical fields, and for spatial interpolation, out-of-sample extension, kriging, machine learning, and feature detection of geological data. We present procedural details and high-level results on real-world examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Geophysical Journal International, August 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[A 3D Multimodal Feature for Infrastructure Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05779v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ageing structures require periodic inspections to identify structural defects. Previous work has used geometric distortions to locate cracks in synthetic masonry bridge point clouds but has struggled to detect small cracks. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel 3D multimodal feature, 3DMulti-FPFHI, that combines a customized Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) with an intensity feature. This feature is integrated into the PatchCore anomaly detection algorithm and evaluated through statistical and parametric analyses. The method is further evaluated using point clouds of a real masonry arch bridge and a full-scale experimental model of a concrete tunnel. Results show that the 3D intensity feature enhances inspection quality by improving crack detection; it also enables the identification of water ingress which introduces intensity anomalies. The 3DMulti-FPFHI outperforms FPFH and a state-of-the-art multimodal anomaly detection method. The potential of the method to address diverse infrastructure anomaly detection scenarios is highlighted by the minimal requirements for data compared to learning-based methods. The code and related point cloud dataset are available at https://github.com/Jingyixiong/3D-Multi-FPFHI.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Jingyixiong/3D-Multi-FPFHI) |
| **[MSMVD: Exploiting Multi-scale Image Features via Multi-scale BEV Features for Multi-view Pedestrian Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20447v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views. Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DEXTER-LLM: Dynamic and Explainable Coordination of Multi-Robot Systems in Unknown Environments via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14387v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model (LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM) for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i) a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods, simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances, with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

| **[I Have Covered All the Bases Here: Interpreting Reasoning Features in Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18878v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning during generation. However, the internal mechanisms behind these reasoning processes remain unexplored. We observe reasoning LLMs consistently use vocabulary associated with human reasoning processes. We hypothesize these words correspond to specific reasoning moments within the models' internal mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. We introduce ReasonScore, an automatic metric to identify active SAE features during these reasoning moments. We perform manual and automatic interpretation of the features detected by our metric, and find those with activation patterns matching uncertainty, exploratory thinking, and reflection. Through steering experiments, we demonstrate that amplifying these features increases performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks (+2.2%) while producing longer reasoning traces (+20.5%). Using the model diffing technique, we provide evidence that these features are present only in models with reasoning capabilities. Our work provides the first step towards a mechanistic understanding of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning) |

However, major challenges such as a lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features, in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance. Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets. This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[C-DOG: Multi-View Multi-instance Feature Association Using Connected δ-Overlap Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14095v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-instance feature association constitutes a crucial step in 3D reconstruction, facilitating the consistent grouping of object instances across various camera perspectives. The presence of multiple identical objects within a scene often leads to ambiguities for appearance-based feature matching algorithms. Our work circumvents this challenge by exclusively employing geometrical constraints, specifically epipolar geometry, for feature association. We introduce C-DOG (Connected delta-Overlap Graph), an algorithm designed for robust geometrical feature association, even in the presence of noisy feature detections. In a C-DOG graph, two nodes representing 2D feature points from distinct views are connected by an edge if they correspond to the same 3D point. Each edge is weighted by its epipolar distance. Ideally, true associations yield a zero distance; however, noisy feature detections can result in non-zero values. To robustly retain edges where the epipolar distance is less than a threshold delta, we employ a Szymkiewicz--Simpson coefficient. This process leads to a delta-neighbor-overlap clustering of 2D nodes. Furthermore, unreliable nodes are pruned from these clusters using an Inter-quartile Range (IQR)-based criterion. Our extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG not only outperforms geometry-based baseline algorithms but also remains remarkably robust under demanding conditions. This includes scenes with high object density, no visual features, and restricted camera overlap, positioning C-DOG as an excellent solution for scalable 3D reconstruction in practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Wind Turbine Feature Detection Using Deep Learning and Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21611v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades, accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting, turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted at ICMV 2025</p></details> | None |

Our IBVS system solves numerical instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower computational and memory cost.

| **[LOCOFY Large Design Models -- Design to code conversion solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16208v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in Large Language Models and Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous challenges related to interpretability, scalability, resource requirements and repeatability remain, related to their application in the design-to-code space. To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models (LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless conversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions for code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models illustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior performance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning, responsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and feature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in identifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our proposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs that subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable production-ready code.</p></details> |  | None |

However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the features used to model system performance, compromising current and future campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and experimental precision in automated materials discovery.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, it still faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware pseudo-labeling. This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF. It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling, drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios. These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for online learning on complex, weakly supervised streaming data.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation.</p></details> |  | None |

A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses YOLO, a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Solar Physics</p></details> | None |

Bots are computer algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on (supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study, using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline; and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.</p></details> | pre-print version | None |

Carbon cycle extremes represent large anomalies in the carbon cycle that are associated with gains or losses in carbon uptake. Carbon cycle extremes could be continuous in space and time and cross political boundaries. Here, we present a methodology to identify large spatiotemporal extremes (STEs) in the terrestrial carbon cycle using image processing tools for feature detection. We characterized the STE events based on neighborhood structures that are three-dimensional adjacency matrices for the detection of spatiotemporal manifolds of carbon cycle extremes. We found that the area affected and carbon loss during negative carbon cycle extremes were consistent with continuous neighborhood structures. In the gross primary production data we used, 100 carbon cycle STEs accounted for more than 75\% of all the negative carbon cycle extremes. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the magnitude of carbon cycle STEs and attribution of those STEs to climate drivers as a function of neighborhood structures for two observational datasets and an Earth system model simulation.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to AIMC 2025</p></details> | None |

This challenge is evident in applications such as multi-view and multi-class scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD, a efficient autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model employs a technique that enhances feature diversity, thereby increasing the effective capacity of the network. It also utilizes large kernel convolution to extract highly abstract patterns, which contribute to efficient and compact feature embedding. Moreover, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Hard Mining Loss (ADCLoss), specifically tailored to FRADs. In our methodology, any dataset can be unified under the framework of feature-rich anomaly detection, in a way that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Our approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple challenging benchmarks.

It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over 7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Although onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in challenging lighting conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

These features are highly interpretable because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach audio deepfake detection using methods that are distinct from those employed in traditional FVC, and offer a new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose.</p></details> |  | None |

Handling petabyte-scale image data requires high-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely used for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization, especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 column IEEE format, 13 Figures</p></details> | None |

However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens. Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature detection.

Due to the high volume of data generated, an automated and reliable biomarker detection pipeline is necessary as a primary screening stage. We outline our new state-of-the-art pipeline for identifying biomarkers from OCT scans. In collaboration with trained ophthalmologists, we identify local and global structures in biomarkers. Through a comprehensive and systematic review of existing vision architectures, we evaluate different convolution and attention mechanisms for biomarker detection. We find that MaxViT, a hybrid vision transformer combining convolution layers with strided attention, is better suited for local feature detection, while EVA-02, a standard vision transformer leveraging pure attention and large-scale knowledge distillation, excels at capturing global features. We ensemble the predictions of both models to achieve first place in the IEEE Video and Image Processing Cup 2023 competition on OCT biomarker detection, achieving a patient-wise F1 score of 0.8527 in the final phase of the competition, scoring 3.8\% higher than the next best solution. Finally, we used knowledge distillation to train a single MaxViT to outperform our ensemble at a fraction of the computation cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks remains a challenge for their reliable deployment in applications, such as navigation of autonomous agents. Even though CNN-based SLAM algorithms are a growing area of research there is a notable absence of a comprehensive presentation and examination of adversarial attacks targeting CNN-based feature detectors, as part of a SLAM system. Our work introduces black-box adversarial perturbations applied to the RGB images fed into the GCN-SLAM algorithm. Our findings on the TUM dataset [30] reveal that even attacks of moderate scale can lead to tracking failure in as many as 76% of the frames. Moreover, our experiments highlight the catastrophic impact of attacking depth instead of RGB input images on the SLAM system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures | None |

While post-hoc methods based on the Mahalanobis distance applied to pre-logit features are among the most effective for ImageNet-scale OOD detection, their performance varies significantly across models. We connect this inconsistency to strong variations in feature norms, indicating severe violations of the Gaussian assumption underlying the Mahalanobis distance estimation. We show that simple $\ell_2$-normalization of the features mitigates this problem effectively, aligning better with the premise of normally distributed data with shared covariance matrix. Extensive experiments on 44 models across diverse architectures and pretraining schemes show that $\ell_2$-normalization improves the conventional Mahalanobis distance-based approaches significantly and consistently, and outperforms other recently proposed OOD detection methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Feature Fusion for UAV Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17983v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images poses significant challenges due to unstable image quality, small object sizes, complex backgrounds, and environmental occlusions. Small objects, in particular, occupy small portions of images, making their accurate detection highly difficult. Existing multi-scale feature fusion methods address these challenges to some extent by aggregating features across different resolutions. However, they often fail to effectively balance the classification and localization performance for small objects, primarily due to insufficient feature representation and imbalanced network information flow. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion framework specifically designed for UAV object detection tasks to enhance both localization accuracy and classification performance. The proposed framework integrates hybrid upsampling and downsampling modules, enabling feature maps from different network depths to be flexibly adjusted to arbitrary resolutions. This design facilitates cross-layer connections and multi-scale feature fusion, ensuring improved representation of small objects. Our approach leverages hybrid downsampling to enhance fine-grained feature representation, improving spatial localization of small targets, even under complex conditions. Simultaneously, the upsampling module aggregates global contextual information, optimizing feature consistency across scales and enhancing classification robustness in cluttered scenes. Experimental results on two public UAV datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Integrated into the YOLO-v10 model, our method achieves a 2% improvement in average precision (AP) compared to the baseline YOLO-v10 model, while maintaining the same number of parameters. These results highlight the potential of our framework for accurate and efficient UAV object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Classical vs Learned Image Matching for Mobile Mapping Cameras to Textured Semantic 3D Building Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17973v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion, and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions. Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve.

However, this approach faces feature misalignment when representations from different hierarchical levels of the feature pyramid are forcibly fused point-to-point. To address this issue, we designed an independent hierarchy pyramid (IHP) architecture to evaluate the effectiveness of the features-unfused-pyramid-neck for multi-head detectors. Subsequently, we introduced soft nearest neighbor interpolation (SNI) with a weight downscaling factor to mitigate the impact of feature fusion at different hierarchies while preserving key textures. Furthermore, we present a features adaptive selection method for down sampling in extended spatial windows (ESD) to retain spatial features and enhance lightweight convolutional techniques (GSConvE). These advancements culminate in our secondary features alignment solution (SA) for real-time detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC and MS COCO.

While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.</p></details> |  | None |

Their assessment is presently either limited to morphometric properties of their mass skeleton or requires labor-intensive qualitative evaluations of visually perceived qualities. This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative Artificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban scenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates OpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version of the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via customizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated mapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street levels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without task-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting scalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments. Two exploratory case studies in Nice and Vienna illustrate SAGAI's capacity to produce geospatial outputs from vision-language inference. The initial results show strong performance for binary urban-rural scene classification, moderate precision in commercial feature detection, and lower estimates, but still informative, of sidewalk width. Fully deployable by any user, SAGAI can be easily adapted to a wide range of urban research themes, such as walkability, safety, or urban design, through prompt modification alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures in main paper, 6 figures in appendices</p></details> | None |
| **[A New Graph Grammar Formalism for Robust Syntactic Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15975v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I introduce a formalism for representing the syntax of recursively structured graph-like patterns. It does not use production rules, like a conventional graph grammar, but represents the syntactic structure in a more direct and declarative way. The grammar and the pattern are both represented as networks, and parsing is seen as the construction of a homomorphism from the pattern to the grammar. The grammars can represent iterative, hierarchical and nested recursive structure in more than one dimension. This supports a highly parallel style of parsing, in which all aspects of pattern recognition (feature detection, segmentation, parsing, filling in missing symbols, top-down and bottom-up inference) are integrated into a single process, to exploit the synergy between them. The emphasis of this paper is on underlying theoretical issues, but I also give some example runs to illustrate the error-tolerant parsing of complex recursively structured patterns of 50-1000 symbols, involving variability in geometric relationships, blurry and indistinct symbols, overlapping symbols, cluttered images, and erased patches.</p></details> | 64 pages, 23 figures | None |
| **[Flow Intelligence: Robust Feature Matching via Temporal Signature Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11949v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching across video streams remains a cornerstone challenge in computer vision. Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest in robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While traditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down when faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning methods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain constrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational demands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves beyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively. Instead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion signatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal motion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve natural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while remaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also requires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature detection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence enables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature-Aware Malicious Output Detection and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09191v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought significant benefits to various domains while introducing substantial risks. Despite being fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, LLMs lack the capability to discern malicious content, limiting their defense against jailbreak. To address these safety concerns, we propose a feature-aware method for harmful response rejection (FMM), which detects the presence of malicious features within the model's feature space and adaptively adjusts the model's rejection mechanism. By employing a simple discriminator, we detect potential malicious traits during the decoding phase. Upon detecting features indicative of toxic tokens, FMM regenerates the current token. By employing activation patching, an additional rejection vector is incorporated during the subsequent token generation, steering the model towards a refusal response. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple language models and diverse attack techniques, while crucially maintaining the models' standard generation capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Their novelty compared to standard cameras lies in the transition from capturing full picture frames at fixed time intervals to a sparse data format which, with its distinctive qualities, offers potential improvements in various applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of reinventing algorithmic procedures or adapting them to effectively process the new data format. In this survey, we systematically examine neuromorphic vision along three main dimensions. First, we highlight the technological evolution and distinctive hardware features of neuromorphic cameras from their inception to recent models. Second, we review image processing algorithms developed explicitly for event-based data, covering key works on feature detection, tracking, and optical flow -which form the basis for analyzing image elements and transformations -as well as depth and pose estimation or object recognition, which interpret more complex scene structures and components. These techniques, drawn from classical computer vision and modern data-driven approaches, are examined to illustrate the breadth of applications for event-based cameras. Third, we present practical application case studies demonstrating how event cameras have been successfully used across various industries and scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges limiting widespread adoption, identify significant research gaps compared to standard imaging techniques, and outline promising future directions and opportunities that neuromorphic vision offers.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages total, 26 without references, two images and five tables.

Vision transformer models show good accuracy on large scale datasets, with features of multi-modal training. Due to their promising feature detection, we aim to explore vision transformer models for diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma versus classical Hodgkin lymphoma using pathology whole slide images of HE slides. We compared the classification performance of the vision transformer to our previously designed convolutional neural network on the same dataset. The dataset includes whole slide images of HE slides for 20 cases, including 10 cases in each diagnostic category. From each whole slide image, 60 image patches having size of 100 by 100 pixels and at magnification of 20 were obtained to yield 1200 image patches, from which 90 percent were used for training, 9 percent for validation, and 10 percent for testing. The test results from the convolutional neural network model had previously shown an excellent diagnostic accuracy of 100 percent. The test results from the vision transformer model also showed a comparable accuracy at 100 percent. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of predictive performance between a vision transformer model and a convolutional neural network model using the same dataset of lymphoma. Overall, convolutional neural network has a more mature architecture than vision transformer and is usually the best choice when large scale pretraining is not an available option. Nevertheless, our current study shows comparable and excellent accuracy of vision transformer compared to that of convolutional neural network even with a relatively small dataset of anaplastic large cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

However, LiDAR point clouds may appear to have sparsity, uneven distribution, and incomplete structures, significantly limiting the detection performance. In road driving environments, target objects referring to vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists are well-suited for enhancing representation through the complete template guidance, considering their grid and topological structures. Therefore, this paper presents an intrinsic-feature-guided 3D object detection method based on a template-assisted feature enhancement module, which extracts intrinsic features from relatively generalized templates and provides rich structural information for foreground objects. Furthermore, a proposal-level contrastive learning mechanism is designed to enhance the feature differences between foreground and background objects. The proposed modules can act as plug-and-play components and improve the performance of multiple existing methods. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed method achieves the highly competitive detection results.

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for high-precision localization using affordable hardware, bridging the gap between consumer-grade sensors and production-level performance requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IV'25</p></details> | None |

As opposed to frame-based cameras, the motion-dependent nature of event cameras presents persistent challenges in achieving robust event feature detection and matching. In recent years, learning-based approaches have demonstrated superior robustness over traditional handcrafted methods in feature detection and matching, particularly under aggressive motion and HDR scenarios. In this paper, we propose SuperEIO, a novel framework that leverages the learning-based event-only detection and IMU measurements to achieve event-inertial odometry. Our event-only feature detection employs a convolutional neural network under continuous event streams. Moreover, our system adopts the graph neural network to achieve event descriptor matching for loop closure. The proposed system utilizes TensorRT to accelerate the inference speed of deep networks, which ensures low-latency processing and robust real-time operation on resource-limited platforms. Besides, we evaluate our method extensively on multiple public datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art event-based methods.

The proposed Hierarchical Polysemantic Feature Embedding framework introduces a structured approach to ransomware detection through hyperbolic feature representations that capture hierarchical dependencies within executable behaviors. By embedding ransomware-relevant features into a non-Euclidean space, the framework maintains a well-defined decision boundary, ensuring improved generalization across previously unseen ransomware variants. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the framework consistently outperformed conventional machine learning-based models, achieving higher detection accuracy while maintaining low false positive rates. The structured clustering mechanism employed within the hyperbolic space enabled robust classification even in the presence of obfuscation techniques, delayed execution strategies, and polymorphic transformations. Comparative analysis highlighted the limitations of existing detection frameworks, particularly in their inability to dynamically adapt to evolving ransomware tactics. Computational efficiency assessments indicated that the proposed method maintained a balance between detection performance and processing overhead, making it a viable candidate for real-world cybersecurity applications. The ability to detect emerging ransomware families without requiring extensive retraining demonstrated the adaptability of hierarchical embeddings in security analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> | None |
| **[D2Fusion: Dual-domain Fusion with Feature Superposition for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17184v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfake detection is crucial for curbing the harm it causes to society. However, current Deepfake detection methods fail to thoroughly explore artifact information across different domains due to insufficient intrinsic interactions. These interactions refer to the fusion and coordination after feature extraction processes across different domains, which are crucial for recognizing complex forgery clues. Focusing on more generalized Deepfake detection, in this work, we introduce a novel bi-directional attention module to capture the local positional information of artifact clues from the spatial domain. This enables accurate artifact localization, thus addressing the coarse processing with artifact features. To further address the limitation that the proposed bi-directional attention module may not well capture global subtle forgery information in the artifact feature (e.g., textures or edges), we employ a fine-grained frequency attention module in the frequency domain. By doing so, we can obtain high-frequency information in the fine-grained features, which contains the global and subtle forgery information. Although these features from the diverse domains can be effectively and independently improved, fusing them directly does not effectively improve the detection performance. Therefore, we propose a feature superposition strategy that complements information from spatial and frequency domains. This strategy turns the feature components into the form of wave-like tokens, which are updated based on their phase, such that the distinctions between authentic and artifact features can be amplified. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on five public Deepfake datasets in capturing abnormalities across different manipulated operations and real-life.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Set Features for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14773v4)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes to use set features for detecting anomalies in samples that consist of unusual combinations of normal elements. Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12245</p></details> | None |

While visual enhancement can improve contrast and clarity, it may introduce visual-tolerant artifacts that obscure the structural integrity of images. Considering the resilience of semantic information against environmental interference, we propose a semantic-driven feature enhancement network for robust homography estimation, dubbed SeFENet. Concretely, we first introduce an innovative hierarchical scale-aware module to expand the receptive field by aggregating multi-scale information, thereby effectively extracting image features under diverse harsh conditions. Subsequently, we propose a semantic-guided constraint module combined with a high-level perceptual framework to achieve degradation-tolerant with semantic feature. A meta-learning-based training strategy is introduced to mitigate the disparity between semantic and structural features. By internal-external alternating optimization, the proposed network achieves implicit semantic-wise feature enhancement, thereby improving the robustness of homography estimation in adverse environments by strengthening the local feature comprehension and context information extraction. Experimental results under both normal and harsh conditions demonstrate that SeFENet significantly outperforms SOTA methods, reducing point match error by at least 41% on the large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Brand Domain Identification (BDI) serves as a crucial step in many phishing detection approaches. This study systematically evaluates the effectiveness of features employed over the past decade for BDI, focusing on their weighted importance in phishing detection as of 2025. The primary objective is to determine whether the identified brand domain matches the claimed domain, utilizing popular features for phishing detection. To validate feature importance and evaluate performance, we conducted two experiments on a dataset comprising 4,667 legitimate sites and 4,561 phishing sites. In Experiment 1, we used the Weka tool to identify optimized and important feature sets out of 5: CN Information(CN), Logo Domain(LD),Form Action Domain(FAD),Most Common Link in Domain(MCLD) and Cookie Domain through its 4 Attribute Ranking Evaluator. The results revealed that none of the features were redundant, and Random Forest emerged as the best classifier, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.7\% with an average response time of 0.08 seconds. In Experiment 2, we trained five machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, and XGBoost to assess the performance of individual BDI features and their combinations. The results demonstrated an accuracy of 99.8\%, achieved with feature combinations of only three features: Most Common Link Domain, Logo Domain, Form Action and Most Common Link Domain,CN Info,Logo Domain using Random Forest as the best classifier. This study underscores the importance of leveraging key domain features for efficient phishing detection and paves the way for the development of real-time, scalable detection systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Language-Assisted Feature Transformation for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01184v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces LAFT, a novel feature transformation method designed to incorporate user knowledge and preferences into anomaly detection using natural language. Accurately modeling the boundary of normality is crucial for distinguishing abnormal data, but this is often challenging due to limited data or the presence of nuisance attributes. While unsupervised methods that rely solely on data without user guidance are common, they may fail to detect anomalies of specific interest. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Assisted Feature Transformation (LAFT), which leverages the shared image-text embedding space of vision-language models to transform visual features according to user-defined requirements. Combined with anomaly detection methods, LAFT effectively aligns visual features with user preferences, allowing anomalies of interest to be detected. Extensive experiments on both toy and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

However, due to the intrinsic complexity of LLMs, effective prompting is more challenging than it may seem. This highlights the need for innovative educational and support strategies that are both widely accessible and seamlessly integrated into task workflows. Yet, LLM prompting is highly task- and domain-dependent, limiting the effectiveness of generic approaches. In this study, we explore whether LLM-based methods can facilitate learning assessments by using ad-hoc guidelines and a minimal number of annotated prompt samples. Our framework transforms these guidelines into features that can be identified within learners' prompts. Using these feature descriptions and annotated examples, we create few-shot learning detectors. We then evaluate different configurations of these detectors, testing three state-of-the-art LLMs and ensembles. We run experiments with cross-validation on a sample of original prompts, as well as tests on prompts collected from task-naive learners. Our results show how LLMs perform on feature detection. Notably, GPT- 4 demonstrates strong performance on most features, while closely related models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo (Instruct), show inconsistent behaviors in feature classification. These differences highlight the need for further research into how design choices impact feature selection and prompt detection. Our findings contribute to the fields of generative AI literacy and computer-supported learning assessment, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for Publication in Educational Technology & Society (ET&S)</p></details> | None |

Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> | None |
| **[Pursuing Feature Separation based on Neural Collapse for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17816v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the open world, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, whose labels are disjoint with those of in-distribution (ID) samples, is important for reliable deep neural networks (DNNs). To achieve better detection performance, one type of approach proposes to fine-tune the model with auxiliary OOD datasets to amplify the difference between ID and OOD data through a separation loss defined on model outputs. However, none of these studies consider enlarging the feature disparity, which should be more effective compared to outputs. The main difficulty lies in the diversity of OOD samples, which makes it hard to describe their feature distribution, let alone design losses to separate them from ID features. In this paper, we neatly fence off the problem based on an aggregation property of ID features named Neural Collapse (NC). NC means that the penultimate features of ID samples within a class are nearly identical to the last layer weight of the corresponding class. Based on this property, we propose a simple but effective loss called Separation Loss, which binds the features of OOD data in a subspace orthogonal to the principal subspace of ID features formed by NC. In this way, the features of ID and OOD samples are separated by different dimensions. By optimizing the feature separation loss rather than purely enlarging output differences, our detection achieves SOTA performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks without any additional data augmentation or sampling, demonstrating the importance of feature separation in OOD detection.

Within this context, the simultaneous detection of significant features and groups aimed at a specific response with false discovery rate (FDR) control stands as a crucial issue, such as the spatial genome-wide association studies. Existing methods typically require maintaining the same detection approach at different resolutions to achieve multilayer FDR control, which may be not efficient. For instance, it is unsuitable to apply knockoff method to detect features with high correlations, therefore, the efficiency of multilayer knockoff filter (MKF) is also not guaranteed. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel method of derandomized flexible e-filter procedure (DFEFP) by developing generalized e-values. This method utilizes a wide variety of base detection procedures that operate effectively across various resolutions to provide stable and consistent results, while controlling the false discovery rate at multiple resolutions simultaneously. Furthermore, we investigate the statistical properties of the DFEFP, encompassing multilayer FDR control, stability guarantee, and solution correctness of algorithm. The DFEFP is initially exemplified to construct an e-value data splitting filter (eDS-filter). Subsequently, the eDS-filter in combination with the group knockoff filter (gKF) is used to develop more flexible methodology which referred to as the eDS+gKF-filter. Simulation studies demonstrate that the eDS+gKF-filter effectively controls FDR at multiple resolutions while either maintaining or enhancing power compared to MKF. The superiority of the eDS+gKF-filter is also demonstrated through the analysis of HIV mutation data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhanced Feature-based Image Stitching for Endoscopic Videos in Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04207v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video endoscopy represents a major advance in the investigation of gastrointestinal diseases. Reviewing endoscopy videos often involves frequent adjustments and reorientations to piece together a complete view, which can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. Image stitching techniques address this issue by providing a continuous and complete visualization of the examined area. However, endoscopic images, particularly those of the esophagus, present unique challenges. The smooth surface, lack of distinct feature points, and non-horizontal orientation complicate the stitching process, rendering traditional feature-based methods often ineffective for these types of images. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing pipeline designed to enhance endoscopic image stitching through advanced computational techniques. Our approach converts endoscopic video data into continuous 2D images by following four key steps: (1) keyframe selection, (2) image rotation adjustment to correct distortions, (3) surface unwrapping using polar coordinate transformation to generate a flat image, and (4) feature point matching enhanced by Adaptive Histogram Equalization for improved feature detection. We evaluate stitching quality through the assessment of valid feature point match pairs. Experiments conducted on 20 pediatric endoscopy videos demonstrate that our method significantly improves image alignment and stitching quality compared to traditional techniques, laying a robust foundation for more effective panoramic image creation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their transformative potential, current SDL implementations rely on rigid, predefined protocols that limit their adaptability to dynamic experimental scenarios across different labs. A significant challenge persists in measuring how effectively AI agents can replicate the adaptive decision-making and experimental intuition of expert scientists. Here, we introduce AILA (Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant), a framework that automates atomic force microscopy (AFM) through LLM-driven agents. Using AFM as an experimental testbed, we develop AFMBench-a comprehensive evaluation suite that challenges AI agents based on language models like GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 to perform tasks spanning the scientific workflow: from experimental design to results analysis. Our systematic assessment shows that state-of-the-art language models struggle even with basic tasks such as documentation retrieval, leading to a significant decline in performance in multi-agent coordination scenarios. Further, we observe that LLMs exhibit a tendency to not adhere to instructions or even divagate to additional tasks beyond the original request, raising serious concerns regarding safety alignment aspects of AI agents for SDLs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of AILA on increasingly complex experiments open-ended experiments: automated AFM calibration, high-resolution feature detection, and mechanical property measurement. Our findings emphasize the necessity for stringent benchmarking protocols before deploying AI agents as laboratory assistants across scientific disciplines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Agtech Framework for Cranberry-Ripening Analysis Using Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09739v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural domains are being transformed by recent advances in AI and computer vision that support quantitative visual evaluation. Using aerial and ground imaging over a time series, we develop a framework for characterizing the ripening process of cranberry crops, a crucial component for precision agriculture tasks such as comparing crop breeds (high-throughput phenotyping) and detecting disease. Using drone imaging, we capture images from 20 waypoints across multiple bogs, and using ground-based imaging (hand-held camera), we image same bog patch using fixed fiducial markers. Both imaging methods are repeated to gather a multi-week time series spanning the entire growing season. Aerial imaging provides multiple samples to compute a distribution of albedo values. Ground imaging enables tracking of individual berries for a detailed view of berry appearance changes. Using vision transformers (ViT) for feature detection after segmentation, we extract a high dimensional feature descriptor of berry appearance. Interpretability of appearance is critical for plant biologists and cranberry growers to support crop breeding decisions (e.g.\ comparison of berry varieties from breeding programs). For interpretability, we create a 2D manifold of cranberry appearance by using a UMAP dimensionality reduction on ViT features. This projection enables quantification of ripening paths and a useful metric of ripening rate. We demonstrate the comparison of four cranberry varieties based on our ripening assessments. This work is the first of its kind and has future impact for cranberries and for other crops including wine grapes, olives, blueberries, and maize. Aerial and ground datasets are made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.00028</p></details> | None |

A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses You Only Look Once(YOLO), a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automatic Image Annotation for Mapped Features Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10438v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting road features is a key enabler for autonomous driving and localization. For instance, a reliable detection of poles which are widespread in road environments can improve localization. Modern deep learning-based perception systems need a significant amount of annotated data. Automatic annotation avoids time-consuming and costly manual annotation. Because automatic methods are prone to errors, managing annotation uncertainty is crucial to ensure a proper learning process. Fusing multiple annotation sources on the same dataset can be an efficient way to reduce the errors. This not only improves the quality of annotations, but also improves the learning of perception models. In this paper, we consider the fusion of three automatic annotation methods in images: feature projection from a high accuracy vector map combined with a lidar, image segmentation and lidar segmentation. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of multi-modal automatic annotation for pole detection through a comparative evaluation on manually annotated images. Finally, the resulting multi-modal fusion is used to fine-tune an object detection model for pole base detection using unlabeled data, showing overall improvements achieved by enhancing network specialization. The dataset is publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Breaking the Frame: Visual Place Recognition by Overlap Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16204v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition methods struggle with occlusions and partial visual overlaps. We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

| **[Construction of generalized samplets in Banach spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00954v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, samplets have been introduced as localized discrete signed measures which are tailored to an underlying data set. Samplets exhibit vanishing moments, i.e., their measure integrals vanish for all polynomials up to a certain degree, which allows for feature detection and data compression. In the present article, we extend the different construction steps of samplets to functionals in Banach spaces more general than point evaluations. To obtain stable representations, we assume that these functionals form frames with square-summable coefficients or even Riesz bases with square-summable coefficients. In either case, the corresponding analysis operator is injective and we obtain samplet bases with the desired properties by means of constructing an isometry of the analysis operator's image. Making the assumption that the dual of the Banach space under consideration is imbedded into the space of compactly supported distributions, the multilevel hierarchy for the generalized samplet construction is obtained by spectral clustering of a similarity graph for the functionals' supports. Based on this multilevel hierarchy, generalized samplets exhibit vanishing moments with respect to a given set of primitives within the Banach space. We derive an abstract localization result for the generalized samplet coefficients with respect to the samplets' support sizes and the approximability of the Banach space elements by the chosen primitives. Finally, we present three examples showcasing the generalized samplet framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Our system consists of 1) a front-end mapping pipeline using a zero-shot segmentation model to extract object masks from images and track them across frames and 2) a frame alignment pipeline that uses the geometric consistency of object relationships to efficiently localize across a variety of conditions. We evaluate SOS-Match on the Batvik seasonal dataset which includes drone flights collected over a coastal plot of southern Finland during different seasons and lighting conditions. Results show that our approach is more robust to changes in lighting and appearance than classical image feature-based approaches or global descriptor methods, and it provides more viewpoint invariance than learning-based feature detection and description approaches. SOS-Match localizes within a reference map up to 46x faster than other feature-based approaches and has a map size less than 0.5% the size of the most compact other maps. SOS-Match is a promising new approach for landmark detection and correspondence search in unstructured environments that is robust to changes in lighting and appearance and is more computationally efficient than other approaches, suggesting that the geometric arrangement of segments is a valuable localization cue in unstructured environments. We release our datasets at https://acl.mit.edu/SOS-Match/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Feature graph construction with static features for malware detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16362v2)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware can greatly compromise the integrity and trustworthiness of information and is in a constant state of evolution. Existing feature fusion-based detection methods generally overlook the correlation between features. And mere concatenation of features will reduce the model's characterization ability, lead to low detection accuracy. Moreover, these methods are susceptible to concept drift and significant degradation of the model. To address those challenges, we introduce a feature graph-based malware detection method, MFGraph, to characterize applications by learning feature-to-feature relationships to achieve improved detection accuracy while mitigating the impact of concept drift. In MFGraph, we construct a feature graph using static features extracted from binary PE files, then apply a deep graph convolutional network to learn the representation of the feature graph. Finally, we employ the representation vectors obtained from the output of a three-layer perceptron to differentiate between benign and malicious software. We evaluated our method on the EMBER dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves an AUC score of 0.98756 on the malware detection task, outperforming other baseline models. Furthermore, the AUC score of MFGraph decreases by only 5.884% in one year, indicating that it is the least affected by concept drift.</p></details> |  | None |

Using robust augmentations and 5-fold cross-validation, we trained two vision transformer-based models: MaxViT and EVA-02, and ensembled them at inference time. We find MaxViT's use of convolution layers followed by strided attention to be better suited for local feature detection while EVA-02's use of normal attention mechanism and knowledge distillation is better for detecting global features. Our solution brought us the champion title of the IEEE SPS Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup 2023, achieving a patient-wise F1 score of 0.814 in the first phase and 0.8527 in the second and final phase of the competition, scoring 3.8% higher than the next best solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ablat...</summary><p>Ablation study results leveraging pseudolabels added in section 3.9</p></details> | None |
| **[Feature Selection for Network Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11603v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network Intrusion Detection (NID) remains a key area of research within the information security community, while also being relevant to Machine Learning (ML) practitioners. The latter generally aim to detect attacks using network features, which have been extracted from raw network data typically using dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA). However, PCA is not able to assess the relevance of features for the task at hand. Consequently, the features available are of varying quality, with some being entirely non-informative. From this, two major drawbacks arise. Firstly, trained and deployed models have to process large amounts of unnecessary data, therefore draining potentially costly resources. Secondly, the noise caused by the presence of irrelevant features can, in some cases, impede a model's ability to detect an attack. In order to deal with these challenges, we present Feature Selection for Network Intrusion Detection (FSNID) a novel information-theoretic method that facilitates the exclusion of non-informative features when detecting network intrusions. The proposed method is based on function approximation using a neural network, which enables a version of our approach that incorporates a recurrent layer. Consequently, this version uniquely enables the integration of temporal dependencies. Through an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method selects a significantly reduced feature set, while maintaining NID performance. Code will be made available upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust AI-Synthesized Speech Detection Using Feature Decomposition Learning and Synthesizer Feature Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09167v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-synthesized speech, also known as deepfake speech, has recently raised significant concerns due to the rapid advancement of speech synthesis and speech conversion techniques. Previous works often rely on distinguishing synthesizer artifacts to identify deepfake speech. However, excessive reliance on these specific synthesizer artifacts may result in unsatisfactory performance when addressing speech signals created by unseen synthesizers. In this paper, we propose a robust deepfake speech detection method that employs feature decomposition to learn synthesizer-independent content features as complementary for detection. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream feature decomposition learning strategy that decomposes the learned speech representation using a synthesizer stream and a content stream. The synthesizer stream specializes in learning synthesizer features through supervised training with synthesizer labels. Meanwhile, the content stream focuses on learning synthesizer-independent content features, enabled by a pseudo-labeling-based supervised learning method. This method randomly transforms speech to generate speed and compression labels for training. Additionally, we employ an adversarial learning technique to reduce the synthesizer-related components in the content stream. The final classification is determined by concatenating the synthesizer and content features. To enhance the model's robustness to different synthesizer characteristics, we further propose a synthesizer feature augmentation strategy that randomly blends the characteristic styles within real and fake audio features and randomly shuffles the synthesizer features with the content features. This strategy effectively enhances the feature diversity and simulates more feature combinations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MapSAM: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Automated Feature Detection in Historical Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06971v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated feature detection in historical maps can significantly accelerate the reconstruction of the geospatial past. However, this process is often constrained by the time-consuming task of manually digitizing sufficient high-quality training data. The emergence of visual foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offers a promising solution due to their remarkable generalization capabilities and rapid adaptation to new data distributions. Despite this, directly applying SAM in a zero-shot manner to historical map segmentation poses significant challenges, including poor recognition of certain geospatial features and a reliance on input prompts, which limits its ability to be fully automated. To address these challenges, we introduce MapSAM, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts SAM into a prompt-free and versatile solution for various downstream historical map segmentation tasks. Specifically, we employ Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the image encoder. Additionally, we develop an automatic prompt generation process, eliminating the need for manual input. We further enhance the positional prompt in SAM, transforming it into a higher-level positional-semantic prompt, and modify the cross-attention mechanism in the mask decoder with masked attention for more effective feature aggregation. The proposed MapSAM framework demonstrates promising performance across two distinct historical map segmentation tasks: one focused on linear features and the other on areal features. Experimental results show that it adapts well to various features, even when fine-tuned with extremely limited data (e.g. 10 shots).</p></details> |  | None |

However, the noise generated by drone propellers has emerged as a significant concern. This may affect the public willingness to implement these vehicles in services that require operation in proximity to residential areas. The standard approaches to address this challenge include sound pressure measurements and noise characteristic analyses. The integration of Artificial Intelligence models in recent years has further streamlined the process by enhancing complex feature detection in drone acoustics data. This study builds upon prior research by examining the efficacy of various Deep Learning models in predicting Psychoacoustic Annoyance, an effective index for measuring perceived annoyance by human ears, based on multiple drone characteristics as input. This is accomplished by constructing a training dataset using precise measurements of various drone models with multiple microphones and analyzing flight data, maneuvers, drone physical characteristics, and perceived annoyance under realistic conditions. The aim of this research is to improve our understanding of drone noise, aid in the development of noise reduction techniques, and encourage the acceptance of drone usage on public spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 10 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> | None |

To validate the convergence of the Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) algorithm, real-world experiments utilizing fiducial markers for feature detection are conducted before designing the CNN-based feature detector. To address the limitations of fiducial markers, the novel feature detector focuses on extracting keypoints that represent the corners of a more realistic object compared to fiducial markers. A dataset is generated from sample data captured by the camera mounted on the robot end-effector while the robot operates randomly in the task space. The samples are automatically labeled, and the dataset size is increased by flipping and rotation. The CNN model is developed by modifying the VGG-19 pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. While the weights in the base model remain fixed, the fully connected layer's weights are updated to minimize the mean absolute error, defined based on the deviation of predictions from the real pixel coordinates of the corners. The model undergoes two modifications: replacing max-pooling with average-pooling in the base model and implementing an adaptive learning rate that decreases during epochs. These changes lead to a 50 percent reduction in validation loss. Finally, the trained model's reliability is assessed through k-fold cross-validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE 2024)</p></details> | None |

Despite advancements in enhancing the robustness of visual features, no existing method measures the utility of visual information before processing by specific feature-type algorithms. To address this gap, we introduce PIXER and the concept of "Featureness," which reflects the inherent interest and reliability of visual information for robust recognition, independent of any specific feature type. Leveraging a generalization on Bayesian learning, our approach quantifies both the probability and uncertainty of a pixel's contribution to robust visual utility in a single-shot process, avoiding costly operations such as Monte Carlo sampling and permitting customizable featureness definitions adaptable to a wide range of applications. We evaluate PIXER on visual odometry with featureness selectivity, achieving an average of 31% improvement in RMSE trajectory with 49% fewer features.</p></details> |  | None |

Many recent architectures, most prominently Large Language Models, have to be trained using supercomputers with thousands of accelerators, such as GPUs or TPUs. Next to the vast number of floating point operations the memory footprint of DNNs is also exploding. In contrast, GPU architectures are notoriously short on memory. Even comparatively small architectures like some EfficientNet variants cannot be trained on a single consumer-grade GPU at reasonable mini-batch sizes. During training, intermediate input activations have to be stored until backpropagation for gradient calculation. These make up the vast majority of the memory footprint. In this work we therefore consider compressing activation maps for the backward pass using pooling, which can reduce both the memory footprint and amount of data movement. The forward computation remains uncompressed. We empirically show convergence and study effects on feature detection at the example of the common vision architecture ResNet. With this approach we are able to reduce the peak memory consumption by 29% at the cost of a longer training schedule, while maintaining prediction accuracy compared to an uncompressed baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ITEM workshop co-located with ECML PKDD 2024, Vilnius LT</p></details> | None |

OOD samples can be drawn from arbitrary distributions and exhibit deviations from in-distribution (ID) data in various dimensions, such as foreground features (e.g., objects in CIFAR100 images vs. those in CIFAR10 images) and background features (e.g., textural images vs. objects in CIFAR10). Existing methods can confound foreground and background features in training, failing to utilize the background features for OOD detection. This paper considers the importance of feature disentanglement in out-of-distribution detection and proposes the simultaneous exploitation of both foreground and background features to support the detection of OOD inputs in in out-of-distribution detection. To this end, we propose a novel framework that first disentangles foreground and background features from ID training samples via a dense prediction approach, and then learns a new classifier that can evaluate the OOD scores of test images from both foreground and background features. It is a generic framework that allows for a seamless combination with various existing OOD detection methods. Extensive experiments show that our approach 1) can substantially enhance the performance of four different state-of-the-art (SotA) OOD detection methods on multiple widely-used OOD datasets with diverse background features, and 2) achieves new SotA performance on these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024, 9 pages</p></details> | None |

The key challenges include non-uniform lighting and poor visibility in turbid environments. High-frequency forward-look sonar cameras address these issues, by providing high-resolution imagery at maximum range of tens of meters, despite complexities posed by high degree of speckle noise, and lack of color and texture. In particular, robust feature detection is an essential initial step for automated object recognition, localization, navigation, and 3-D mapping. Various local feature detectors developed for RGB images are not well-suited for sonar data. To assess their performances, we evaluate a number of feature detectors using real sonar images from five different sonar devices. Performance metrics such as detection accuracy, false positives, and robustness to variations in target characteristics and sonar devices are applied to analyze the experimental results. The study would provide a deeper insight into the bottlenecks of feature detection for sonar data, and developing more effective methods</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-scale Feature Fusion with Point Pyramid for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04601v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective point cloud processing is crucial to LiDARbased autonomous driving systems. The capability to understand features at multiple scales is required for object detection of intelligent vehicles, where road users may appear in different sizes. Recent methods focus on the design of the feature aggregation operators, which collect features at different scales from the encoder backbone and assign them to the points of interest. While efforts are made into the aggregation modules, the importance of how to fuse these multi-scale features has been overlooked. This leads to insufficient feature communication across scales. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Point Pyramid RCNN (POP-RCNN), a feature pyramid-based framework for 3D object detection on point clouds. POP-RCNN consists of a Point Pyramid Feature Enhancement (PPFE) module to establish connections across spatial scales and semantic depths for information exchange. The PPFE module effectively fuses multi-scale features for rich information without the increased complexity in feature aggregation. To remedy the impact of inconsistent point densities, a point density confidence module is deployed. This design integration enables the use of a lightweight feature aggregator, and the emphasis on both shallow and deep semantics, realising a detection framework for 3D object detection. With great adaptability, the proposed method can be applied to a variety of existing frameworks to increase feature richness, especially for long-distance detection. By adopting the PPFE in the voxel-based and point-voxel-based baselines, experimental results on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset show that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance even with limited computational headroom.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

Current Android malware detection methods often rely on feature engineering to construct dynamic or static features, which are then used for learning. However, static feature-based methods struggle to counter code obfuscation, packing, and signing techniques, while dynamic feature-based methods involve time-consuming feature extraction. Image-based methods for Android malware detection offer better resilience against malware variants and polymorphic malware. This paper proposes an end-to-end Android malware detection technique based on RGB images and multi-feature fusion. The approach involves extracting Dalvik Executable (DEX) files, AndroidManifest.xml files, and API calls from APK files, converting them into grayscale images, and enhancing their texture features using Canny edge detection, histogram equalization, and adaptive thresholding techniques. These grayscale images are then combined into an RGB image containing multi-feature fusion information, which is analyzed using mainstream image classification models for Android malware detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures Android malware characteristics, achieving an accuracy of up to 97.25%, outperforming existing detection methods that rely solely on DEX files as classification features. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of using the three key files for feature representation in the proposed approach.</p></details> | 9 pages,10 figures | None |

Despite the notable achievements in previous research, two primary challenges persist. Firstly, the main issue is the singleness of feature extraction. Secondly, the detection process fails to effectively integrate with objects of varying sizes or scales. These issues are also prevalent in generic object detection. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel object detection network named Efficient Multi-scale and Diverse Feature Network (EMDFNet) for traffic sign detection that integrates an Augmented Shortcut Module and an Efficient Hybrid Encoder to address the aforementioned issues simultaneously. Specifically, the Augmented Shortcut Module utilizes multiple branches to integrate various spatial semantic information and channel semantic information, thereby enhancing feature diversity. The Efficient Hybrid Encoder utilizes global feature fusion and local feature interaction based on various features to generate distinctive classification features by integrating feature information in an adaptable manner. Extensive experiments on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) benchmark and the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) demonstrate that our EMDFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors in performance while retaining the real-time processing capabilities of single-stage models.

Typically, reconstruction algorithms first identify common features across images and then minimize reconstruction errors after estimating the shape of the terrain. This bundle adjustment (BA) step optimizes around a single, simplifying scalar value that obfuscates many possible causes of reconstruction errors (e.g., initial estimate of the position and orientation of the camera, lighting conditions, ease of feature detection in the terrain). Reconstruction errors can lead to inaccurate scientific inferences or endanger a spacecraft exploring a remote environment. To address this challenge, we present VECTOR, a visual analysis tool that improves error inspection for stereo reconstruction BA. VECTOR provides analysts with previously unavailable visibility into feature locations, camera pose, and computed 3D points.

We addressed these challenges by creating a physics-based synthetic image and data generator, resulting in a machine learning model that achieves comparable precision (0.86), recall (0.63), F1 scores (0.71), and engineering property predictions (R2=0.82) to a model trained on human-labeled data. We enhanced both models by using feature prediction confidence scores to derive an image-wide confidence metric, enabling simple thresholding to eliminate ambiguous and out-of-domain images resulting in performance boosts of 5-30% with a filtering-out rate of 25%. Our study demonstrates that synthetic data can eliminate human reliance in ML and provides a means for domain awareness in cases where many feature detections per image are needed.</p></details> |  | None |

Our model draws on the success of previous learning-based feature detection and description methods. To better leverage unlabeled data and constrain the model to reproduce relevant keypoints, we integrate a keypoint-based segmentation task. It is trained in a self-supervised manner by enforcing segmentation consistency between different augmentations of the same image. By incorporating a keypoint augmented self-supervised layer, we achieve robust feature extraction across modalities. Extensive evaluation on two public datasets and one in-house dataset demonstrates significant improvements in performance for modality-agnostic retinal feature alignment.

| **[DyFADet: Dynamic Feature Aggregation for Temporal Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03197v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent proposed neural network-based Temporal Action Detection (TAD) models are inherently limited to extracting the discriminative representations and modeling action instances with various lengths from complex scenes by shared-weights detection heads. Inspired by the successes in dynamic neural networks, in this paper, we build a novel dynamic feature aggregation (DFA) module that can simultaneously adapt kernel weights and receptive fields at different timestamps. Based on DFA, the proposed dynamic encoder layer aggregates the temporal features within the action time ranges and guarantees the discriminability of the extracted representations. Moreover, using DFA helps to develop a Dynamic TAD head (DyHead), which adaptively aggregates the multi-scale features with adjusted parameters and learned receptive fields better to detect the action instances with diverse ranges from videos. With the proposed encoder layer and DyHead, a new dynamic TAD model, DyFADet, achieves promising performance on a series of challenging TAD benchmarks, including HACS-Segment, THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, Epic-Kitchen 100, Ego4D-Moment QueriesV1.0, and FineAction.

| **[Segment Anything Model is a Good Teacher for Local Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16992v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local feature detection and description play an important role in many computer vision tasks, which are designed to detect and describe keypoints in "any scene" and "any downstream task". Data-driven local feature learning methods need to rely on pixel-level correspondence for training, which is challenging to acquire at scale, thus hindering further improvements in performance. In this paper, we propose SAMFeat to introduce SAM (segment anything model), a fundamental model trained on 11 million images, as a teacher to guide local feature learning and thus inspire higher performance on limited datasets. To do so, first, we construct an auxiliary task of Attention-weighted Semantic Relation Distillation (ASRD), which distillates feature relations with category-agnostic semantic information learned by the SAM encoder into a local feature learning network, to improve local feature description using semantic discrimination. Second, we develop a technique called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning Based on Semantic Grouping (WSC), which utilizes semantic groupings derived from SAM as weakly supervised signals, to optimize the metric space of local descriptors. Third, we design an Edge Attention Guidance (EAG) to further improve the accuracy of local feature detection and description by prompting the network to pay more attention to the edge region guided by SAM. SAMFeat's performance on various tasks such as image matching on HPatches, and long-term visual localization on Aachen Day-Night showcases its superiority over previous local features.

| **[Detection-Rate-Emphasized Multi-objective Evolutionary Feature Selection for Network Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09180v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network intrusion detection is one of the most important issues in the field of cyber security, and various machine learning techniques have been applied to build intrusion detection systems. However, since the number of features to describe the network connections is often large, where some features are redundant or noisy, feature selection is necessary in such scenarios, which can both improve the efficiency and accuracy. Recently, some researchers focus on using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to select features. But usually, they only consider the number of features and classification accuracy as the objectives, resulting in unsatisfactory performance on a critical metric, detection rate. This will lead to the missing of many real attacks and bring huge losses to the network system. In this paper, we propose DR-MOFS to model the feature selection problem in network intrusion detection as a three-objective optimization problem, where the number of features, accuracy and detection rate are optimized simultaneously, and use MOEAs to solve it. Experiments on two popular network intrusion detection datasets NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 show that in most cases the proposed method can outperform previous methods, i.e., lead to fewer features, higher accuracy and detection rate.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous research has widely explored features extracted from pre-trained models (PTMs) primarily trained for paralinguistic tasks. Although these features have led to sufficient advances in speech-based depression detection, their performance declines in real-world settings. To address this, in this paper, we introduce ComFeAT, an application that employs a CNN model trained on a combination of features extracted from PTMs, a.k.a. neural features and spectral features to enhance depression detection. Spectral features are robust to domain variations, but, they are not as good as neural features in performance, suprisingly, combining them shows complementary behavior and improves over both neural and spectral features individually. The proposed method also improves over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) works on E-DAIC benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2024 Show & Tell Demonstrations</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, the lack of focus on user intention type in queries affected the efficiency of QP in prevailing works. Thus, by using a Contextual Fuzzy Linguistic Inference System (CFLIS), this work analyzed the informational, navigational, and transactional-based intents in queries for enhanced QP. Primarily, the user query is parsed using tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, stemming, and POS tagging and then expanded using the WordNet technique. After expanding the queries, to enhance query understanding and to facilitate more accurate analysis and retrieval in query processing, the named entity is recognized using Bidirectional Encoder UnispecNorm Representations from Transformers (BEUNRT). Next, for efficient QP and retrieval of query information from the semantic cache database, the data is structured using Epanechnikov Kernel-Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (EK-OPTICS). The features are extracted from the structured data. Now, sentence type is identified and intent keywords are extracted from the parsed query. Next, the extracted features, detected intents and structured data are inputted to the Multi-head Gated Recurrent Learnable Attention Unit (MGR-LAU), which processes the query based on a semantic cache database (stores previously interpreted queries to expedite effective future searches). Moreover, the query is processed with a minimum latency of 12856ms. Lastly, the Semantic Similarity (SS) is analyzed between the retrieved query and the inputted user query, which continues until the similarity reaches 0.9 and above. Thus, the proposed work surpassed the previous methodologies.</p></details> | 10 Pages. Preprint | None |

However, processing the event data requires either using expensive feature descriptors to transform spikes into frames, or using spiking neural networks that are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a neural network architecture, Reservoir Nodes-enabled neuromorphic vision sensing Network (RN-Net), based on simple convolution layers integrated with dynamic temporal encoding reservoirs for local and global spatiotemporal feature detection with low hardware and training costs. The RN-Net allows efficient processing of asynchronous temporal features, and achieves the highest accuracy of 99.2% for DVS128 Gesture reported to date, and one of the highest accuracy of 67.5% for DVS Lip dataset at a much smaller network size. By leveraging the internal device and circuit dynamics, asynchronous temporal feature encoding can be implemented at very low hardware cost without preprocessing and dedicated memory and arithmetic units. The use of simple DNN blocks and standard backpropagation-based training rules further reduces implementation costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

The existing works achieve excellent performance in the anomaly detection, but with complex networks or cumbersome pipelines. To address this issue, this paper explores a simple but effective architecture in the anomaly detection. It consists of a well pre-trained encoder to extract hierarchical feature representations and a decoder to reconstruct these intermediate features from the encoder. In particular, it does not require any data augmentations and anomalous images for training. The anomalies can be detected when the decoder fails to reconstruct features well, and then errors of hierarchical feature reconstruction are aggregated into an anomaly map to achieve anomaly localization. The difference comparison between those features of encoder and decode lead to more accurate and robust localization results than the comparison in single feature or pixel-by-pixel comparison in the conventional works. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MVTec Anomaly Detection datasets on both anomaly detection and localization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |

In this study, we explore a novel approach to Deepfake detection by utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) measured from the neural processing of a human participant who viewed and categorized Deepfake stimuli from the FaceForensics++ datset. These measurements serve as input features to a binary support vector classifier, trained to discriminate between real and manipulated facial images. We examine whether EEG data can inform Deepfake detection and also if it can provide a generalized representation capable of identifying Deepfakes beyond the training domain. Our preliminary results indicate that human neural processing signals can be successfully integrated into Deepfake detection frameworks and hint at the potential for a generalized neural representation of artifacts in computer generated faces. Moreover, our study provides next steps towards the understanding of how digital realism is embedded in the human cognitive system, possibly enabling the development of more realistic digital avatars in the future.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing methods have achieved impressive accuracy in training dataset detection, they still perform poorly in the unseen domain and suffer from forgery of irrelevant information such as background and identity, affecting generalizability. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel framework Selective Domain-Invariant Feature (SDIF), which reduces the sensitivity to face forgery by fusing content features and styles. Specifically, we first use a Farthest-Point Sampling (FPS) training strategy to construct a task-relevant style sample representation space for fusing with content features. Then, we propose a dynamic feature extraction module to generate features with diverse styles to improve the performance and effectiveness of the feature extractor. Finally, a domain separation strategy is used to retain domain-related features to help distinguish between real and fake faces. Both qualitative and quantitative results in existing benchmarks and proposals demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning Expressive And Generalizable Motion Features For Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05172v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous face forgery detection methods mainly focus on appearance features, which may be easily attacked by sophisticated manipulation. Considering the majority of current face manipulation methods generate fake faces based on a single frame, which do not take frame consistency and coordination into consideration, artifacts on frame sequences are more effective for face forgery detection. However, current sequence-based face forgery detection methods use general video classification networks directly, which discard the special and discriminative motion information for face manipulation detection. To this end, we propose an effective sequence-based forgery detection framework based on an existing video classification method. To make the motion features more expressive for manipulation detection, we propose an alternative motion consistency block instead of the original motion features module. To make the learned features more generalizable, we propose an auxiliary anomaly detection block. With these two specially designed improvements, we make a general video classification network achieve promising results on three popular face forgery datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2023</p></details> | None |

This capacity is widely studied in the visual domain using the Raven's Progressive Matrices. Recent advances in deep learning have led to multiple artificial neural network models matching or even surpassing human performance. However, while humans can identify and express the rule underlying these tasks with little to no exposure, contemporary neural networks often rely on massive pattern-based training and cannot express or extrapolate the rule inferred from the task. Furthermore, most Raven's Progressive Matrices or Raven-like tasks used for neural network training used symbolic representations, whereas humans can flexibly switch between symbolic and continuous perceptual representations. In this work, we present an algorithmic approach to rule detection and application using feature detection, affine transformation estimation and search. We applied our model to a simplified Raven's Progressive Matrices task, previously designed for behavioral testing and neuroimaging in humans. The model exhibited one-shot learning and achieved near human-level performance in the symbolic reasoning condition of the simplified task. Furthermore, the model can express the relationships discovered and generate multi-step predictions in accordance with the underlying rule. Finally, the model can reason using continuous patterns. We discuss our results and their relevance to studying abstract reasoning in humans, as well as their implications for improving intelligent machines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Causal Features for Incremental Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00591v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection limits its recognizable categories during the training phase, in which it can not cover all objects of interest for users. To satisfy the practical necessity, the incremental learning ability of the detector becomes a critical factor for real-world applications. Unfortunately, neural networks unavoidably meet catastrophic forgetting problem when it is implemented on a new task. To this end, many incremental object detection models preserve the knowledge of previous tasks by replaying samples or distillation from previous models. However, they ignore an important factor that the performance of the model mostly depends on its feature. These models try to rouse the memory of the neural network with previous samples but not to prevent forgetting. To this end, in this paper, we propose an incremental causal object detection (ICOD) model by learning causal features, which can adapt to more tasks. Traditional object detection models, unavoidably depend on the data-bias or data-specific features to get the detection results, which can not adapt to the new task. When the model meets the requirements of incremental learning, the data-bias information is not beneficial to the new task, and the incremental learning may eliminate these features and lead to forgetting. To this end, our ICOD is introduced to learn the causal features, rather than the data-bias features when training the detector. Thus, when the model is implemented to a new task, the causal features of the old task can aid the incremental learning process to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem. We conduct our model on several experiments, which shows a causal feature without data-bias can make the model adapt to new tasks better. \keywords{Object detection, incremental learning, causal feature.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional rule-based systems struggle to keep pace with evolving fraud tactics, leading to high false positive rates and missed detections. Machine learning techniques offer a promising solution by leveraging historical data to identify fraudulent patterns. This article explores using the personalised PageRank (PPR) algorithm to capture the social dynamics of fraud by analysing relationships between financial accounts. The primary objective is to compare the performance of traditional features with the addition of PPR in fraud detection models. Results indicate that integrating PPR enhances the model's predictive power, surpassing the baseline model. Additionally, the PPR feature provides unique and valuable information, evidenced by its high feature importance score. Feature stability analysis confirms consistent feature distributions across training and test datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

We leverage a video representation framework called ADDER to transcode framed videos to sparse, asynchronous intensity samples. We introduce mechanisms for content adaptation, lossy compression, and asynchronous forms of classical vision algorithms. We evaluate our system on the VIRAT surveillance video dataset, and we show a median 43.7% speed improvement in FAST feature detection compared to OpenCV.

In this work, we show that both standard SIR sampling and rejection-based optimal sampling are suitable for efficient (10 to 20 ms) real-time pose tracking without feature detection that is using raw point clouds from a 3D LiDAR. Motivated by the large amount of information captured by these sensors, we perform a systematic statistical analysis of how many points are actually required to reach an optimal ratio between efficiency and positioning accuracy. Furthermore, initialization from adverse conditions, e.g., poor GPS signal in urban canyons, we also identify the optimal particle filter settings required to ensure convergence. Our findings include that a decimation factor between 100 and 200 on incoming point clouds provides a large savings in computational cost with a negligible loss in localization accuracy for a VLP-16 scanner. Furthermore, an initial density of $\sim$2 particles/m$^2$ is required to achieve 100% convergence success for large-scale ($\sim$100,000 m$^2$), outdoor global localization without any additional hint from GPS or magnetic field sensors.

This approximation class replaces the associated density with the composition of: (i) a feature map that identifies the leading principal components or features of the target measure, relative to the reference, and (ii) a low-dimensional profile function. When the reference measure satisfies a subspace $\phi$-Sobolev inequality, we construct a computationally tractable approximation that yields certifiable error guarantees with respect to the Amari $\alpha$-divergences. Our construction proceeds in two stages. First, for any feature map and any $\alpha$-divergence, we obtain an analytical expression for the optimal profile function. Second, for linear feature maps, the principal features are obtained from eigenvectors of a matrix involving gradients of the log-density. Neither step requires explicit access to normalizing constants. Notably, by leveraging the $\phi$-Sobolev inequalities, we demonstrate that these features universally certify approximation errors across the range of $\alpha$-divergences $\alpha \in (0,1]$. We then propose an application to Bayesian inverse problems and provide an analogous construction with approximation guarantees that hold in expectation over the data. We conclude with an extension of the proposed dimension reduction strategy to nonlinear feature maps.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Bernoulli, but this version contains both the main file and the supplementary material</p></details> | None |

For time-series simulations and experiments, their data often need to be decimated over timesteps to accommodate storage and I/O limitations. In this paper, we propose a technique that addresses storage costs while improving post-analysis accuracy through spatiotemporal adaptive, error-controlled lossy compression. We investigate the trade-off between data precision and temporal output rates, revealing that reducing data precision and increasing timestep frequency lead to more accurate analysis outcomes. Additionally, we integrate spatiotemporal feature detection with data compression and demonstrate that performing adaptive error-bounded compression in higher dimensional space enables greater compression ratios, leveraging the error propagation theory of a transformation-based compressor. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments using the well-known E3SM climate simulation code and apply our method to compress variables used for cyclone tracking. Our results show a significant reduction in storage size while enhancing the quality of cyclone tracking analysis, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in comparison to the prevalent timestep decimation approach. Compared to three state-of-the-art lossy compressors lacking feature preservation capabilities, our adaptive compression framework improves perfectly matched cases in TC tracking by 26.4-51.3% at medium compression ratios and by 77.3-571.1% at large compression ratios, with a merely 5-11% computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 figures, 2023 IEEE International Conference on e-Science and Grid Computing</p></details> | None |

To improve the detection performance, input features into an ML model should be investigated specifically. In the existing pulsar detection researches based on ML methods, there are mainly two kinds of feature designs: the empirical features and statistical features. Due to the combinational effects from multiple features, however, there exist some redundancies and even irrelevant components in the available features, which can reduce the accuracy of a pulsar detection model. Therefore, it is essential to select a subset of relevant features from a set of available candidate features and known as {\itshape feature selection.} In this work, two feature selection algorithms ----\textit{Grid Search} (GS) and \textit{Recursive Feature Elimination} (RFE)---- are proposed to improve the detection performance by removing the redundant and irrelevant features. The algorithms were evaluated on the Southern High Time Resolution University survey (HTRU-S) with five pulsar detection models. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed feature selection algorithms. By the GS, a model with only two features reach a recall rate as high as 99\% and a false positive rate (FPR) as low as 0.65\%; By the RFE, another model with only three features achieves a recall rate 99\% and an FPR of 0.16\% in pulsar candidates classification. Furthermore, this work investigated the number of features required as well as the misclassified pulsars by our models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures | None |

In particular, dendritic branches play a key role in temporal signal processing and feature detection, using coincidence detection (CD) mechanisms, made possible by the presence of synaptic delays that align temporally disparate inputs for effective integration. Computational studies on spiking neural networks further highlight the significance of delays for CD operations, enabling spatio-temporal pattern recognition within feed-forward neural networks without the need for recurrent architectures. In this work, we present DenRAM, the first realization of a spiking neural network with analog dendritic circuits, integrated into a 130nm technology node coupled with resistive memory (RRAM) technology. DenRAM's dendritic circuits use the RRAM devices to implement both delays and synaptic weights in the network. By configuring the RRAM devices to reproduce bio-realistic timescales, and through exploiting their heterogeneity, we experimentally demonstrate DenRAM's capability to replicate synaptic delay profiles, and efficiently implement CD for spatio-temporal pattern recognition. To validate the architecture, we conduct comprehensive system-level simulations on two representative temporal benchmarks, highlighting DenRAM's resilience to analog hardware noise, and its superior accuracy compared to recurrent architectures with an equivalent number of parameters. DenRAM not only brings rich temporal processing capabilities to neuromorphic architectures, but also reduces the memory footprint of edge devices, provides high accuracy on temporal benchmarks, and represents a significant step-forward in low-power real-time signal processing technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a majority of map dataset have never been discovered, acquired and effectively used, and the map data used in many applications might not be completely fitted for the authentic demands of these applications. This challenge is emerged due to the lack of numerous well-labelled benchmark datasets for implementing the deep learning approaches into identifying complicated map content. Thus, we develop a large-scale benchmark dataset that includes well-labelled dataset for map text annotation recognition, map scene classification, map super-resolution reconstruction, and map style transferring. Furthermore, these well-labelled datasets would facilitate the state-of-the-art machine intelligence technologies to conduct map feature detection, map pattern recognition and map content retrieval.

We propose ROBUSfT, a conventional pipeline based on a template containing the object's rest shape, texturemap and deformation law. ROBUSfT is ready-to-use, wide-baseline, capable of handling large deformations, fast up to 30 fps, free of training, and robust against partial occlusions and discontinuity in video frames. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in challenging datasets. ROBUSfT is implemented as a publicly available C++ library and we provide a tutorial on how to use it in https://github.com/mrshetab/ROBUSfT</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the arXiv version of an article published in Image and Vision Computing.

| **[Adversarial Learning for Feature Shift Detection and Correction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04546v1)** | 2023-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data shift is a phenomenon present in many real-world applications, and while there are multiple methods attempting to detect shifts, the task of localizing and correcting the features originating such shifts has not been studied in depth. Feature shifts can occur in many datasets, including in multi-sensor data, where some sensors are malfunctioning, or in tabular and structured data, including biomedical, financial, and survey data, where faulty standardization and data processing pipelines can lead to erroneous features. In this work, we explore using the principles of adversarial learning, where the information from several discriminators trained to distinguish between two distributions is used to both detect the corrupted features and fix them in order to remove the distribution shift between datasets. We show that mainstream supervised classifiers, such as random forest or gradient boosting trees, combined with simple iterative heuristics, can localize and correct feature shifts, outperforming current statistical and neural network-based techniques.

However, these methods ignore the relationship among humans, objects, and interactions: 1) human features are more contributive than object ones to interaction prediction; 2) interactive information disturbs the detection of objects but helps human detection. In this paper, we propose a Human and Object Disentangling Network (HODN) to model the HOI relationships explicitly, where humans and objects are first detected by two disentangling decoders independently and then processed by an interaction decoder. Considering that human features are more contributive to interaction, we propose a Human-Guide Linking method to make sure the interaction decoder focuses on the human-centric regions with human features as the positional embeddings. To handle the opposite influences of interactions on humans and objects, we propose a Stop-Gradient Mechanism to stop interaction gradients from optimizing the object detection but to allow them to optimize the human detection. Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the V-COCO and the HICO-Det datasets. It can be combined with existing methods easily for state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM 2023 | None |
| **[PRS: Sharp Feature Priors for Resolution-Free Surface Remeshing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18494v1)** | 2023-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface reconstruction with preservation of geometric features is a challenging computer vision task. Despite significant progress in implicit shape reconstruction, state-of-the-art mesh extraction methods often produce aliased, perceptually distorted surfaces and lack scalability to high-resolution 3D shapes. We present a data-driven approach for automatic feature detection and remeshing that requires only a coarse, aliased mesh as input and scales to arbitrary resolution reconstructions. We define and learn a collection of surface-based fields to (1) capture sharp geometric features in the shape with an implicit vertexwise model and (2) approximate improvements in normals alignment obtained by applying edge-flips with an edgewise model. To support scaling to arbitrary complexity shapes, we learn our fields using local triangulated patches, fusing estimates on complete surface meshes. Our feature remeshing algorithm integrates the learned fields as sharp feature priors and optimizes vertex placement and mesh connectivity for maximum expected surface improvement. On a challenging collection of high-resolution shape reconstructions in the ABC dataset, our algorithm improves over state-of-the-art by 26% normals F-score and 42% perceptual $\text{RMSE}_{\text{v}}$.</p></details> |  | None |

This work discusses methods and challenges in data-driven modeling of automated damage and defect detectors using X-ray single- and multi-projection (CT) images. Three main issues are identified: Data and feature variance, data feature labeling (for supervised machine learning), and the missing ground truth. It will be shown that only simulation of data can deliver a ground truth data set and accurate labeling. Noise has significant impact on the feature detection and will be discussed. Data-driven feature detectors are implemented with semantic pixel- or z-profile Convolutional Neural Networks and LSTM Auto-encoders. Data is measured with three different devices: A low-quality and low-cost (Low-Q), a mid- and a high-quality (micro-CT, Mid-/High-Q) device.

| **[Homography Initialization and Dynamic Weighting Algorithm Based on a Downward-Looking Camera and IMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09622v1)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the technology in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has matured considerably and has been widely used in many applications. However, we still encounter challenges when applying VIO to a micro air vehicle (MAV) equipped with a downward-looking camera. Specifically, VIO cannot compute the correct initialization results during take-off and the cumulative drift is large when the MAV is flying in the air. To overcome these problems, we propose a homographybased initialization method, which utilizes the fact that the features detected by the downward-looking camera during take-off are approximately on the same plane. Then we introduce the prior normal vector and motion field to make states more accurate. In addition, to deal with the cumulative drift, a strategy for dynamically weighting visual residuals is proposed. Finally, we evaluate our method on the collected real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can be successfully initialized no matter how the MAV takes off and the positioning errors are also greatly improved.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UCF: Uncovering Common Features for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13949v2)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfake detection remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of generalizing to new types of forgeries. This problem primarily stems from the overfitting of existing detection methods to forgery-irrelevant features and method-specific patterns. The latter has been rarely studied and not well addressed by previous works. This paper presents a novel approach to address the two types of overfitting issues by uncovering common forgery features. Specifically, we first propose a disentanglement framework that decomposes image information into three distinct components: forgery-irrelevant, method-specific forgery, and common forgery features. To ensure the decoupling of method-specific and common forgery features, a multi-task learning strategy is employed, including a multi-class classification that predicts the category of the forgery method and a binary classification that distinguishes the real from the fake. Additionally, a conditional decoder is designed to utilize forgery features as a condition along with forgery-irrelevant features to generate reconstructed images. Furthermore, a contrastive regularization technique is proposed to encourage the disentanglement of the common and specific forgery features. Ultimately, we only utilize the common forgery features for the purpose of generalizable deepfake detection. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework can perform superior generalization than current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Skipped Feature Pyramid Network with Grid Anchor for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14453v1)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CNN-based object detection methods have achieved significant progress in recent years. The classic structures of CNNs produce pyramid-like feature maps due to the pooling or other re-scale operations. The feature maps in different levels of the feature pyramid are used to detect objects with different scales. For more accurate object detection, the highest-level feature, which has the lowest resolution and contains the strongest semantics, is up-scaled and connected with the lower-level features to enhance the semantics in the lower-level features. However, the classic mode of feature connection combines the feature of lower-level with all the features above it, which may result in semantics degradation. In this paper, we propose a skipped connection to obtain stronger semantics at each level of the feature pyramid. In our method, the lower-level feature only connects with the feature at the highest level, making it more reasonable that each level is responsible for detecting objects with fixed scales. In addition, we simplify the generation of anchor for bounding box regression, which can further improve the accuracy of object detection. The experiments on the MS COCO and Wider Face demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

This study provides a systematic analysis of glottal source features and investigates their effectiveness in voice pathology detection. Glottal source features are extracted using glottal flows estimated with the quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering method, using approximate glottal source signals computed with the zero frequency filtering (ZFF) method, and using acoustic voice signals directly. In addition, we propose to derive mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from the glottal source waveforms computed by QCP and ZFF to effectively capture the variations in glottal source spectra of pathological voice. Experiments were carried out using two databases, the Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias (HUPA) database and the Saarbrucken Voice Disorders (SVD) database. Analysis of features revealed that the glottal source contains information that discriminates normal and pathological voice. Pathology detection experiments were carried out using support vector machine (SVM). From the detection experiments it was observed that the performance achieved with the studied glottal source features is comparable or better than that of conventional MFCCs and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) features. The best detection performance was achieved when the glottal source features were combined with the conventional MFCCs and PLP features, which indicates the complementary nature of the features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2020 IEEE.

A novel self-supervised approach is proposed to stratify landscape based on mobility activity time series. First, the time series signal is transformed to the frequency domain and then compressed into task-agnostic temporal embeddings by a contractive autoencoder, which preserves cyclic temporal patterns observed in time series. The pixel-wise embeddings are converted to image-like channels that can be used for task-based, multimodal modeling of downstream geospatial tasks using deep semantic segmentation. Experiments show that temporal embeddings are semantically meaningful representations of time series data and are effective across different tasks such as classifying residential area and commercial areas. Temporal embeddings transform sequential, spatiotemporal motion trajectory data into semantically meaningful image-like tensor representations that can be combined (multimodal fusion) with other data modalities that are or can be transformed into image-like tensor representations (for e.g., RBG imagery, graph embeddings of road networks, passively collected imagery like SAR, etc.) to facilitate multimodal learning in geospatial computer vision. Multimodal computer vision is critical for training machine learning models for geospatial feature detection to keep a geospatial mapping service up-to-date in real-time and can significantly improve user experience and above all, user safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract accepted for presentation at BayLearn 2023. 3 pages, 7 figures.

Camera tampering can occur due to natural events or it can be caused intentionally to disrupt surveillance. We cast tampering detection as a change detection problem, and perform a review of the existing literature with emphasis on feature types. We formulate tampering detection as a time series analysis problem, and design experiments to study the robustness and capability of various feature types. We compute ten features on real-world surveillance video and apply time series analysis to ascertain their predictability, and their capability to detect tampering. Finally, we quantify the performance of various time series models using each feature type to detect tampering.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Advances in Kth nearest-neighbour clutter removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06467v1)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of feature detection in the presence of clutter in spatial point processes. Classification methods have been developed in previous studies. Among these, Byers and Raftery (1998) models the observed Kth nearest neighbour distances as a mixture distribution and classifies the clutter and feature points consequently. In this paper, we enhance such approach in two manners. First, we propose an automatic procedure for selecting the number of nearest neighbours to consider in the classification method by means of segmented regression models. Secondly, with the aim of applying the procedure multiple times to get a ``better" end result, we propose a stopping criterion that minimizes the overall entropy measure of cluster separation between clutter and feature points. The proposed procedures are suitable for a feature with clutter as two superimposed Poisson processes on any space, including linear networks. We present simulations and two case studies of environmental data to illustrate the method.</p></details> |  | None |

Several of these approaches also combine other sensors (inertial sensing, for example) to perform combined state estimation. Our work rethinks this approach; we present a representation learning mechanism that identifies visual features that best correspond to robot motion as estimated by an external signal. Specifically, we utilize the robot's transformations through an external signal (inertial sensing, for example) and give attention to image space that is most consistent with the external signal. We use a pairwise consistency metric as a representation to keep the visual features consistent through a sequence with the robot's relative pose transformations. This approach enables us to incorporate information from the robot's perspective instead of solely relying on the image attributes. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets such as KITTI & EuRoC and compare the refined features with existing feature descriptors. We also evaluate our method using our real robot experiment. We notice an average of 49% reduction in the image search space without compromising the trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method reduces the execution time of visual odometry by 4.3% and also reduces reprojection errors. We demonstrate the need to select only the most important features and show the competitiveness using various feature detection baselines.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[AFPN: Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15988v2)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-scale features are of great importance in encoding objects with scale variance in object detection tasks. A common strategy for multi-scale feature extraction is adopting the classic top-down and bottom-up feature pyramid networks. However, these approaches suffer from the loss or degradation of feature information, impairing the fusion effect of non-adjacent levels. This paper proposes an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) to support direct interaction at non-adjacent levels. AFPN is initiated by fusing two adjacent low-level features and asymptotically incorporates higher-level features into the fusion process. In this way, the larger semantic gap between non-adjacent levels can be avoided. Given the potential for multi-object information conflicts to arise during feature fusion at each spatial location, adaptive spatial fusion operation is further utilized to mitigate these inconsistencies. We incorporate the proposed AFPN into both two-stage and one-stage object detection frameworks and evaluate with the MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets. Experimental evaluation shows that our method achieves more competitive results than other state-of-the-art feature pyramid networks.

| **[Generalized Differentiable RANSAC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13185v3)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose $\nabla$-RANSAC, a generalized differentiable RANSAC that allows learning the entire randomized robust estimation pipeline. The proposed approach enables the use of relaxation techniques for estimating the gradients in the sampling distribution, which are then propagated through a differentiable solver. The trainable quality function marginalizes over the scores from all the models estimated within $\nabla$-RANSAC to guide the network learning accurate and useful inlier probabilities or to train feature detection and matching networks. Our method directly maximizes the probability of drawing a good hypothesis, allowing us to learn better sampling distributions. We test $\nabla$-RANSAC on various real-world scenarios on fundamental and essential matrix estimation, and 3D point cloud registration, outdoors and indoors, with handcrafted and learning-based features. It is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy while running at a similar speed to its less accurate alternatives.

HTTP-based Trojan, in particular, accounts for a considerable proportion of them. Moreover, as the network environment becomes more complex, HTTP-based Trojan is more concealed than others. At present, many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are increasingly difficult to effectively detect such Trojan traffic due to the inherent shortcomings of the methods used and the backwardness of training data. Classical anomaly detection and traditional machine learning-based (TML-based) anomaly detection are highly dependent on expert knowledge to extract features artificially, which is difficult to implement in HTTP-based Trojan traffic detection. Deep learning-based (DL-based) anomaly detection has been locally applied to IDSs, but it cannot be transplanted to HTTP-based Trojan traffic detection directly. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a neural network detection model (HSTF-Model) based on hierarchical spatiotemporal features of traffic. Meanwhile, we combine deep learning algorithms with expert knowledge through feature encoders and statistical characteristics to improve the self-learning ability of the model. Experiments indicate that F1 of HSTF-Model can reach 99.4% in real traffic. In addition, we present a dataset BTHT consisting of HTTP-based benign and Trojan traffic to facilitate related research in the field.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, we argue that the potential of these methods has been underestimated, as they offer crucial information for crowd analysis that is often ignored. Specifically, the area size and confidence score of output proposals and bounding boxes provide insight into the scale and density of the crowd. To leverage these underutilized features, we propose Crowd Hat, a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with existing detection models. This module uses a mixed 2D-1D compression technique to refine the output features and obtain the spatial and numerical distribution of crowd-specific information. Based on these features, we further propose region-adaptive NMS thresholds and a decouple-then-align paradigm that address the major limitations of detection-based methods. Our extensive evaluations on various crowd analysis tasks, including crowd counting, localization, and detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing output features and the potential of detection-based methods in crowd analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://fredfyyang.github.io/Crowd-Hat/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://fredfyyang.github.io/Crowd-Hat) |

Not only there is a large choice for different sensors, but also these can be transported by different platforms, which can provide different scan geometries. In this work we test the extraction of four different keypoint detectors and three feature descriptors. We benchmark performance in terms of calculation time and we assess their performance in terms of accuracy in their ability in coarse automatic co-registration of two clouds that are collected with different sensors, platforms and scan geometries. One, which we define as having the higher accuracy, and thus will be used as reference, was surveyed via a UAV flight with a Riegl MiniVUX-3, the other on a bicycle with a Livox Horizon over a walking path with un-even ground.The novelty in this work consists in comparing several strategies for fast alignment of point clouds from very different surveying geometries, as the drone has a bird's eye view and the bicycle a ground-based view. An added challenge is related to the lower cost of the bicycle sensor ensemble that, together with the rough terrain, reasonably results in lower accuracy of the survey. The main idea is to use range images to capture a simplified version of the geometry of the surveyed area and then find the best features to match keypoints. Results show that NARF features detected more keypoints and resulted in a faster co-registration procedure in this scenariowhereas the accuracy of the co-registration is similar to all the combinations of keypoint detectors and features.</p></details> |  | None |

The complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder necessitate prompt and effective detection, which nonetheless, poses a difficult challenge. This situation highlights an urgent requirement for improved detection methods. Exploiting auditory data through advanced machine learning paradigms presents promising research directions. Yet, existing techniques mainly rely on single-dimensional feature models, potentially neglecting the abundance of information hidden in various speech characteristics. To rectify this, we present the novel Attention-Based Acoustic Feature Fusion Network (ABAFnet) for depression detection. ABAFnet combines four different acoustic features into a comprehensive deep learning model, thereby effectively integrating and blending multi-tiered features. We present a novel weight adjustment module for late fusion that boosts performance by efficaciously synthesizing these features. The effectiveness of our approach is confirmed via extensive validation on two clinical speech databases, CNRAC and CS-NRAC, thereby outperforming previous methods in depression detection and subtype classification. Further in-depth analysis confirms the key role of each feature and highlights the importance of MFCCrelated features in speech-based depression detection.</p></details> |  | None |

In Poisson surface reconstruction, the implicit function is generated by a set of smooth basis functions centered at the octnodes. When the octree depth is properly selected, the reconstructed surface is a good smooth approximation of the noisy point set. Our method projects the noisy points onto the surface and alternately reconstructs and projects the point set. We use the iterative Poisson surface reconstruction (iPSR) to support unoriented surface reconstruction. Our method iteratively performs iPSR and acts as an outer loop of iPSR. Considering that the octree depth significantly affects the reconstruction results, we propose an adaptive depth selection strategy to ensure an appropriate depth choice. To manage the oversmoothing phenomenon near the sharp features, we propose a $\lambda$-projection method, which means to project the noisy points onto the surface with an individual control coefficient $\lambda_{i}$ for each point. The coefficients are determined through a Voronoi-based feature detection method. Experimental results show that our method achieves high performance in point cloud denoising and unoriented surface reconstruction within different noise scales, and exhibits well-rounded performance in various types of inputs.

| **[Centralized Feature Pyramid for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02093v1)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual feature pyramid has shown its superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency in a wide range of applications. However, the existing methods exorbitantly concentrate on the inter-layer feature interactions but ignore the intra-layer feature regulations, which are empirically proved beneficial. Although some methods try to learn a compact intra-layer feature representation with the help of the attention mechanism or the vision transformer, they ignore the neglected corner regions that are important for dense prediction tasks. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Centralized Feature Pyramid (CFP) for object detection, which is based on a globally explicit centralized feature regulation. Specifically, we first propose a spatial explicit visual center scheme, where a lightweight MLP is used to capture the globally long-range dependencies and a parallel learnable visual center mechanism is used to capture the local corner regions of the input images. Based on this, we then propose a globally centralized regulation for the commonly-used feature pyramid in a top-down fashion, where the explicit visual center information obtained from the deepest intra-layer feature is used to regulate frontal shallow features. Compared to the existing feature pyramids, CFP not only has the ability to capture the global long-range dependencies, but also efficiently obtain an all-round yet discriminative feature representation. Experimental results on the challenging MS-COCO validate that our proposed CFP can achieve the consistent performance gains on the state-of-the-art YOLOv5 and YOLOX object detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/QY1994-0919/CFPNet</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/QY1994-0919/CFPNet) |

| **[MAP: A Model-agnostic Pretraining Framework for Click-through Rate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01737v1)** | 2023-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of personalized online services, click-through rate (CTR) prediction has received more and more attention and research. The most prominent features of CTR prediction are its multi-field categorical data format, and vast and daily-growing data volume. The large capacity of neural models helps digest such massive amounts of data under the supervised learning paradigm, yet they fail to utilize the substantial data to its full potential, since the 1-bit click signal is not sufficient to guide the model to learn capable representations of features and instances. The self-supervised learning paradigm provides a more promising pretrain-finetune solution to better exploit the large amount of user click logs, and learn more generalized and effective representations. However, self-supervised learning for CTR prediction is still an open question, since current works on this line are only preliminary and rudimentary. To this end, we propose a Model-agnostic pretraining (MAP) framework that applies feature corruption and recovery on multi-field categorical data, and more specifically, we derive two practical algorithms: masked feature prediction (MFP) and replaced feature detection (RFD). MFP digs into feature interactions within each instance through masking and predicting a small portion of input features, and introduces noise contrastive estimation (NCE) to handle large feature spaces. RFD further turns MFP into a binary classification mode through replacing and detecting changes in input features, making it even simpler and more effective for CTR pretraining. Our extensive experiments on two real-world large-scale datasets (i.e., Avazu, Criteo) demonstrate the advantages of these two methods on several strong backbones (e.g., DCNv2, DeepFM), and achieve new state-of-the-art performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency for CTR prediction.</p></details> | KDD 2023 | None |
| **[Changer: Feature Interaction is What You Need for Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08290v1)** | 2023-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection is an important tool for long-term earth observation missions. It takes bi-temporal images as input and predicts "where" the change has occurred. Different from other dense prediction tasks, a meaningful consideration for change detection is the interaction between bi-temporal features. With this motivation, in this paper we propose a novel general change detection architecture, MetaChanger, which includes a series of alternative interaction layers in the feature extractor. To verify the effectiveness of MetaChanger, we propose two derived models, ChangerAD and ChangerEx with simple interaction strategies: Aggregation-Distribution (AD) and "exchange". AD is abstracted from some complex interaction methods, and "exchange" is a completely parameter\&computation-free operation by exchanging bi-temporal features. In addition, for better alignment of bi-temporal features, we propose a flow dual-alignment fusion (FDAF) module which allows interactive alignment and feature fusion. Crucially, we observe Changer series models achieve competitive performance on different scale change detection datasets. Further, our proposed ChangerAD and ChangerEx could serve as a starting baseline for future MetaChanger design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

We extend the classification method developed in previous studies to this more complex geometric context, where the classical properties of a point process change and data visualization are not intuitive. We use the K-th nearest neighbour volumes distribution in linear networks for this approach. As a result, our method is suitable for analysing point patterns consisting of features and clutter as two superimposed Poisson processes on the same linear network. To illustrate the method, we present simulations and examples of road traffic accidents that resulted in injuries or deaths in two cities in Colombia.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection: Feature Selection versus Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01570v1)** | 2023-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of things (IoT) has been playing an important role in many sectors, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing. However, IoT devices are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which may result in security breaches and data leakages. To effectively prevent these attacks, a variety of machine learning-based network intrusion detection methods for IoT networks have been developed, which often rely on either feature extraction or feature selection techniques for reducing the dimension of input data before being fed into machine learning models. This aims to make the detection complexity low enough for real-time operations, which is particularly vital in any intrusion detection systems. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between these two feature reduction methods of intrusion detection in terms of various performance metrics, namely, precision rate, recall rate, detection accuracy, as well as runtime complexity, in the presence of the modern UNSW-NB15 dataset as well as both binary and multiclass classification. For example, in general, the feature selection method not only provides better detection performance but also lower training and inference time compared to its feature extraction counterpart, especially when the number of reduced features K increases. However, the feature extraction method is much more reliable than its selection counterpart, particularly when K is very small, such as K = 4. Additionally, feature extraction is less sensitive to changing the number of reduced features K than feature selection, and this holds true for both binary and multiclass classifications. Based on this comparison, we provide a useful guideline for selecting a suitable intrusion detection type for each specific scenario, as detailed in Tab. 14 at the end of Section IV.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the proliferation of image editing software, altering key information in documents has become widely accessible. Nearly all approaches in this domain rely on a procedural approach, using carefully generated features and a hand-tuned scoring system, rather than a data-driven and generalizable approach. We frame this issue as a graph comparison problem using the character bounding boxes, and propose a model that leverages graph features using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Our model relies on a data-driven approach to detect alterations by training a random forest classifier on the graph-based OCR features. We evaluate our algorithm's forgery detection performance on dataset constructed from real business documents with slight forgery imperfections. Our proposed model dramatically outperforms the most closely-related document manipulation detection model on this task.</p></details> |  | None |

The integration of machine learning with quantum computing has the potential to yield tools offering not only better accuracy and computational efficiency, but also superior robustness against adversarial attacks. Indeed, recent work has employed quantum mechanical phenomena to defend against adversarial attacks, spurring the rapid development of the field of quantum adversarial machine learning (QAML) and potentially yielding a new source of quantum advantage. Despite promising early results, there remain challenges towards building robust real-world QAML tools. In this review we discuss recent progress in QAML and identify key challenges. We also suggest future research directions which could determine the route to practicality for QAML approaches as quantum computing hardware scales up and noise levels are reduced.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 4 Figures | None |

Prior methods focus on extracting large amounts of often redundant locally reliable features, resulting in limited efficiency and accuracy, especially in large-scale environments under challenging conditions. Instead, we propose to extract globally reliable features by implicitly embedding high-level semantics into both the detection and description processes. Specifically, our semantic-aware detector is able to detect keypoints from reliable regions (e.g. building, traffic lane) and suppress unreliable areas (e.g. sky, car) implicitly instead of relying on explicit semantic labels. This boosts the accuracy of keypoint matching by reducing the number of features sensitive to appearance changes and avoiding the need of additional segmentation networks at test time. Moreover, our descriptors are augmented with semantics and have stronger discriminative ability, providing more inliers at test time. Particularly, experiments on long-term large-scale visual localization Aachen Day-Night and RobotCar-Seasons datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms previous local features and gives competitive accuracy to advanced matchers but is about 2 and 3 times faster when using 2k and 4k keypoints, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023. code is available at https://github.com/feixue94/sfd2</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/feixue94/sfd2) |

Several different detection methods have been presented as a countermeasure. Many methods are based on so-called front-ends, which, by transforming the raw audio, emphasize features crucial for assessing the genuineness of the audio sample. Our contribution contains investigating the influence of the state-of-the-art Whisper automatic speech recognition model as a DF detection front-end. We compare various combinations of Whisper and well-established front-ends by training 3 detection models (LCNN, SpecRNet, and MesoNet) on a widely used ASVspoof 2021 DF dataset and later evaluating them on the DF In-The-Wild dataset. We show that using Whisper-based features improves the detection for each model and outperforms recent results on the In-The-Wild dataset by reducing Equal Error Rate by 21%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Multiresolution Feature Guidance Based Transformer for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14880v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is represented as an unsupervised learning to identify deviated images from normal images. In general, there are two main challenges of anomaly detection tasks, i.e., the class imbalance and the unexpectedness of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a multiresolution feature guidance method based on Transformer named GTrans for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization. In GTrans, an Anomaly Guided Network (AGN) pre-trained on ImageNet is developed to provide surrogate labels for features and tokens. Under the tacit knowledge guidance of the AGN, the anomaly detection network named Trans utilizes Transformer to effectively establish a relationship between features with multiresolution, enhancing the ability of the Trans in fitting the normal data manifold. Due to the strong generalization ability of AGN, GTrans locates anomalies by comparing the differences in spatial distance and direction of multi-scale features extracted from the AGN and the Trans. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed GTrans achieves state-of-the-art performance in both detection and localization on the MVTec AD dataset. GTrans achieves image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection AUROC scores of 99.0% and 97.9% on the MVTec AD dataset, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

This article proposes a feature detection method applicable to visuotactile sensors based on continuous marker patterns (CMP) to measure 3-d deformation. First, we construct the feature model of checkerboard-like corners under contact deformation, and design a novel double-layer circular sampler. Then, we propose the judging criteria and response function of corner features by analyzing sampling signals' amplitude-frequency characteristics and circular cross-correlation behavior. The proposed feature detection algorithm fully considers the boundary characteristics retained by the corners with geometric distortion, thus enabling reliable detection at a low calculation cost. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significant advantages in terms of real-time and robustness. Finally, we have achieved the high-density 3-d contact deformation visualization based on this detection method. This technique is able to clearly record the process of contact deformation, thus enabling inverse sensing of dynamic contact processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures.

Conventional satellite or aerial-based remote sensing (RS) platforms can provide the necessary data sources for the 3D reconstruction of large-scale landforms and cities. Even with low-altitude UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), 3D reconstruction in complicated situations, such as urban canyons and indoor scenes, is challenging due to frequent tracking failures between camera frames and high data collection costs. Recently, spherical images have been extensively used due to the capability of recording surrounding environments from one camera exposure. In contrast to perspective images with limited FOV (Field of View), spherical images can cover the whole scene with full horizontal and vertical FOV and facilitate camera tracking and data acquisition in these complex scenes. With the rapid evolution and extensive use of professional and consumer-grade spherical cameras, spherical images show great potential for the 3D modeling of urban and indoor scenes. Classical 3D reconstruction pipelines, however, cannot be directly used for spherical images. Besides, there exist few software packages that are designed for the 3D reconstruction of spherical images. As a result, this research provides a thorough survey of the state-of-the-art for 3D reconstruction of spherical images in terms of data acquisition, feature detection and matching, image orientation, and dense matching as well as presenting promising applications and discussing potential prospects. We anticipate that this study offers insightful clues to direct future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Application of Affective Measures in Text-based Emotion Aware Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04796v1)** | 2023-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an innovative approach to address the problems researchers face in Emotion Aware Recommender Systems (EARS): the difficulty and cumbersome collecting voluminously good quality emotion-tagged datasets and an effective way to protect users' emotional data privacy. Without enough good-quality emotion-tagged datasets, researchers cannot conduct repeatable affective computing research in EARS that generates personalized recommendations based on users' emotional preferences. Similarly, if we fail to fully protect users' emotional data privacy, users could resist engaging with EARS services. This paper introduced a method that detects affective features in subjective passages using the Generative Pre-trained Transformer Technology, forming the basis of the Affective Index and Affective Index Indicator (AII). Eliminate the need for users to build an affective feature detection mechanism. The paper advocates for a separation of responsibility approach where users protect their emotional profile data while EARS service providers refrain from retaining or storing it. Service providers can update users' Affective Indices in memory without saving their privacy data, providing Affective Aware recommendations without compromising user privacy. This paper offers a solution to the subjectivity and variability of emotions, data privacy concerns, and evaluation metrics and benchmarks, paving the way for future EARS research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning-Based Framework for Camera Calibration with Distortion Correction and High Precision Feature Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00158v3)** | 2023-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera calibration is a crucial technique which significantly influences the performance of many robotic systems. Robustness and high precision have always been the pursuit of diverse calibration methods. State-of-the-art calibration techniques based on classical Zhang's method, however, still suffer from environmental noise, radial lens distortion and sub-optimal parameter estimation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid camera calibration framework which combines learning-based approaches with traditional methods to handle these bottlenecks. In particular, this framework leverages learning-based approaches to perform efficient distortion correction and robust chessboard corner coordinate encoding. For sub-pixel accuracy of corner detection, a specially-designed coordinate decoding algorithm with embed outlier rejection mechanism is proposed. To avoid sub-optimal estimation results, we improve the traditional parameter estimation by RANSAC algorithm and achieve stable results. Compared with two widely-used camera calibration toolboxes, experiment results on both real and synthetic datasets manifest the better robustness and higher precision of the proposed framework. The massive synthetic dataset is the basis of our framework's decent performance and will be publicly available along with the code at https://github.com/Easonyesheng/CCS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Easonyesheng/CCS) |

A Random forest classifier was trained in a leave-one-out protocol on three landmarks-based face morphing methods and a StyleGAN-based morphing method for which morphed images are available in the FRLL database. For morphing attack detection, the Discrete Cosine-Transformation-based method obtained the best results for synthetic images and BSIF for landmark-based image features.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data-driven Feature Tracking for Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12826v3)** | 2023-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Because of their high temporal resolution, increased resilience to motion blur, and very sparse output, event cameras have been shown to be ideal for low-latency and low-bandwidth feature tracking, even in challenging scenarios. Existing feature tracking methods for event cameras are either handcrafted or derived from first principles but require extensive parameter tuning, are sensitive to noise, and do not generalize to different scenarios due to unmodeled effects. To tackle these deficiencies, we introduce the first data-driven feature tracker for event cameras, which leverages low-latency events to track features detected in a grayscale frame. We achieve robust performance via a novel frame attention module, which shares information across feature tracks. By directly transferring zero-shot from synthetic to real data, our data-driven tracker outperforms existing approaches in relative feature age by up to 120% while also achieving the lowest latency. This performance gap is further increased to 130% by adapting our tracker to real data with a novel self-supervision strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works introduce deep learning-based semantic information to SLAM systems to reduce the influence of dynamic objects. However, it is still challenging to apply a robust localization in dynamic environments for resource-restricted robots. This paper proposes a real-time RGB-D inertial odometry system for resource-restricted robots in dynamic environments named Dynamic-VINS. Three main threads run in parallel: object detection, feature tracking, and state optimization. The proposed Dynamic-VINS combines object detection and depth information for dynamic feature recognition and achieves performance comparable to semantic segmentation. Dynamic-VINS adopts grid-based feature detection and proposes a fast and efficient method to extract high-quality FAST feature points. IMU is applied to predict motion for feature tracking and moving consistency check. The proposed method is evaluated on both public datasets and real-world applications and shows competitive localization accuracy and robustness in dynamic environments. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, it is the best-performance real-time RGB-D inertial odometry for resource-restricted platforms in dynamic environments for now.

Recent research in this field has primarily centered around multimodal approaches for addressing this issue.In this paper, a multimodal fusion approach based on result feature-level fusion is proposed. This method utilizes the outcome features generated from single modality sources, and fuses them for downstream tasks.Based on this method, a new post-fusing network is proposed for multimodal object detection, which leverages the single modality outcomes as features. The proposed approach, called Multi-Modal Detector based on Result features (MMDR), is designed to work for both 2D and 3D object detection tasks. Compared to previous multimodal models, the proposed approach in this paper performs feature fusion at a later stage, enabling better representation of the deep-level features of single modality sources. Additionally, the MMDR model incorporates shallow global features during the feature fusion stage, endowing the model with the ability to perceive background information and the overall input, thereby avoiding issues such as missed detections.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures | None |

For this, several time- and frequency-domain features have been proposed already in the past. However, these features are usually evaluated on data originating from relatively simple scenarios and a significant performance loss can be observed if more realistic scenarios are considered. To overcome this, we introduce Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and features extracted from the Amplitude Modulation Spectrogram (AMS) as features for the detection of bearing faults. Both AMS and MFCCs were originally introduced in the context of audio signal processing but it is demonstrated that a significantly improved classification performance can be obtained by using these features. Furthermore, to tackle the characteristic data imbalance problem in the context of bearing fault detection, i.e., typically much more data from healthy bearings than from damaged bearings is available, we propose to train a One-class \ac{SVM} with data from healthy bearings only. Bearing faults are then classified by the detection of outliers. Our approach is evaluated with data measured in a highly challenging scenario comprising a state-of-the-art commuter railway engine which is supplied by an industrial power converter and coupled to a load machine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Inter-Noise 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[Marker-based Visual SLAM leveraging Hierarchical Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01155v2)** | 2023-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiducial markers can encode rich information about the environment and can aid Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approaches in reconstructing maps with practical semantic information. Current marker-based VSLAM approaches mainly utilize markers for improving feature detections in low-feature environments and/or for incorporating loop closure constraints, generating only low-level geometric maps of the environment prone to inaccuracies in complex environments. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a VSLAM approach utilizing a monocular camera along with fiducial markers to generate hierarchical representations of the environment while improving the camera pose estimate. The proposed approach detects semantic entities from the surroundings, including walls, corridors, and rooms encoded within markers, and appropriately adds topological constraints among them. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected with a robot demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a traditional marker-based VSLAM baseline in terms of accuracy, given the addition of new constraints while creating enhanced map representations. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory results when comparing the reconstructed map quality to the one reconstructed using a LiDAR SLAM approach.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Semantic Validation in Structure from Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02420v1)** | 2023-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Structure from Motion (SfM) challenge in computer vision is the process of recovering the 3D structure of a scene from a series of projective measurements that are calculated from a collection of 2D images, taken from different perspectives. SfM consists of three main steps; feature detection and matching, camera motion estimation, and recovery of 3D structure from estimated intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and features. A problem encountered in SfM is that scenes lacking texture or with repetitive features can cause erroneous feature matching between frames. Semantic segmentation offers a route to validate and correct SfM models by labelling pixels in the input images with the use of a deep convolutional neural network. The semantic and geometric properties associated with classes in the scene can be taken advantage of to apply prior constraints to each class of object. The SfM pipeline COLMAP and semantic segmentation pipeline DeepLab were used. This, along with planar reconstruction of the dense model, were used to determine erroneous points that may be occluded from the calculated camera position, given the semantic label, and thus prior constraint of the reconstructed plane. Herein, semantic segmentation is integrated into SfM to apply priors on the 3D point cloud, given the object detection in the 2D input images. Additionally, the semantic labels of matched keypoints are compared and inconsistent semantically labelled points discarded. Furthermore, semantic labels on input images are used for the removal of objects associated with motion in the output SfM models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a data-set of 1102 images of a repetitive architecture scene. This project offers a novel method for improved validation of 3D SfM models.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous approaches train the feature pyramid and detection head from scratch, which breaks the vision-text feature alignment established during pretraining, and struggles to prevent the language model from forgetting unseen classes. We propose three methods to alleviate these issues. Firstly, a simple scheme is used to augment the text embeddings which prevents overfitting to a small number of classes seen during training, while simultaneously saving memory and computation. Secondly, the feature pyramid network and the detection head are modified to include trainable gated shortcuts, which encourages vision-text feature alignment and guarantees it at the start of detection training. Finally, a self-training approach is used to leverage a larger corpus of image-text pairs thus improving detection performance on classes with no human annotated bounding boxes. Our three methods are evaluated on the zero-shot version of the LVIS benchmark, each of them showing clear and significant benefits. Our final network achieves the new stateof-the-art on the mAP-all metric and demonstrates competitive performance for mAP-rare, as well as superior transfer to COCO and Objects365.</p></details> |  | None |

Feature rankings may be distorted by influential points (IP), but such effects are rarely mentioned in previous studies. This study aimed to investigate the impact of IPs on feature rankings and propose a new method to detect IPs. Method The present study utilized a case-deletion (i.e., leave-one-out) approach to assess the impact of cases. The influence of a case was measured by comparing the rank changes before and after the deletion of that case. We proposed a rank comparison method using adaptive top-prioritized weights that highlighted the rank changes of the top-ranked features. The weights were adjustable to the distribution of rank changes. Results Potential IPs could be observed in several datasets. The presence of IPs could significantly alter the results of the following analysis (e.g., enriched pathways), suggesting the necessity of IPs detection when deriving feature rankings. Compared with existing methods, the novel rank comparison method could identify rank changes of important (top-ranked) features because of employing the adaptive weights adjusted to the distribution of rank changes. Conclusions IPs detection should be routinely performed when deriving feature rankings. The new method for IPs detection exhibited favorable features compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

An empirical study on natural feature detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09660v1)** | 2023-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the interpretability of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) models has become critically important to open the "black box" of complex AI models, such as deep learning. This paper compares popular saliency map generation techniques and their strengths and weaknesses in interpreting GeoAI and deep learning models' reasoning behaviors, particularly when applied to geospatial analysis and image processing tasks. We surveyed two broad classes of model explanation methods: perturbation-based and gradient-based methods. The former identifies important image areas, which help machines make predictions by modifying a localized area of the input image. The latter evaluates the contribution of every single pixel of the input image to the model's prediction results through gradient backpropagation. In this study, three algorithms-the occlusion method, the integrated gradients method, and the class activation map method-are examined for a natural feature detection task using deep learning. The algorithms' strengths and weaknesses are discussed, and the consistency between model-learned and human-understandable concepts for object recognition is also compared.

These flaws are highly likely ex-ploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of ser-vice. C and C++ open source code are now available in order to create a large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a siz-able dataset of millions of open-source functions that point to poten-tial exploits. We created an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural network model Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model Long Short Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the de-pendency. Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state of the art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance, we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, re-call, accuracy, and total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as semantic and syntactic represen-tation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs faster than its classical counterpart.</p></details> |  | None |

Extended to metrology, goals include estimating SE yield at each pixel and detecting differences in SE yield across pixels; obstacles include shot noise in the particle source as well as lack of knowledge of and variability in the instrument response to single SEs. A recently introduced time-resolved measurement paradigm promises mitigation of source shot noise, but its analysis and development have been largely limited to estimation problems under an idealization in which SE bursts are directly and perfectly counted. Here, analyses are extended to error exponents in feature detection problems and to degraded measurements that are representative of actual instrument behavior for estimation problems. For estimation from idealized SE counts, insights on existing estimators and a superior estimator are also provided. For estimation in a realistic PBM imaging scenario, extensions to the idealized model are introduced, methods for model parameter extraction are discussed, and large improvements from time-resolved data are presented.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures | None |

Rip currents are dangerous strong currents that can drag beachgoers out to sea. Most people are either unaware of them or do not know what they look like. In some instances, even trained personnel such as lifeguards have difficulty identifying them. RipViz produces a simple, easy to understand visualization of rip location overlaid on the source video. With RipViz, we first obtain an unsteady 2D vector field from the stationary video using optical flow. Movement at each pixel is analyzed over time. At each seed point, sequences of short pathlines, rather a single long pathline, are traced across the frames of the video to better capture the quasi-periodic flow behavior of wave activity. Because of the motion on the beach, the surf zone, and the surrounding areas, these pathlines may still appear very cluttered and incomprehensible. Furthermore, lay audiences are not familiar with pathlines and may not know how to interpret them. To address this, we treat rip currents as a flow anomaly in an otherwise normal flow. To learn about the normal flow behavior, we train an LSTM autoencoder with pathline sequences from normal ocean, foreground, and background movements. During test time, we use the trained LSTM autoencoder to detect anomalous pathlines (i.e., those in the rip zone). The origination points of such anomalous pathlines, over the course of the video, are then presented as points within the rip zone. RipViz is fully automated and does not require user input. Feedback from domain expert suggests that RipViz has the potential for wider use.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the article published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2023</p></details> | None |

Our defense is based on the intuition that the feature extraction layers of a backdoored network embed new features to detect the presence of a trigger and the subsequent classification layers learn to mispredict when triggers are detected. Therefore, to detect backdoors, the proposed defense uses two synergistic anomaly detectors trained on clean validation data: the first is a novelty detector that checks for anomalous features, while the second detects anomalous mappings from features to outputs by comparing with a separate classifier trained on validation data. The approach is evaluated on a wide range of backdoored networks (with multiple variations of triggers) that successfully evade state-of-the-art defenses. Additionally, we evaluate the robustness of our approach on imperceptible perturbations, scalability on large-scale datasets, and effectiveness under domain shift. This paper also shows that the defense can be further improved using data augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploiting Neighborhood Structural Features for Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05114v1)** | 2023-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, a novel method for change detection is proposed using neighborhood structure correlation. Because structure features are insensitive to the intensity differences between bi-temporal images, we perform the correlation analysis on structure features rather than intensity information. First, we extract the structure feature maps by using multi-orientated gradient information. Then, the structure feature maps are used to obtain the Neighborhood Structural Correlation Image (NSCI), which can represent the context structure information. In addition, we introduce a measure named matching error which can be used to improve neighborhood information. Subsequently, a change detection model based on the random forest is constructed. The NSCI feature and matching error are used as the model inputs for training and prediction. Finally, the decision tree voting is used to produce the change detection result. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, it was compared with three state-of-the-art change detection methods. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

The ability to match MRI images would also enable such applications as indexing and searching MRI images among multiple patients or selecting images from the region of interest. In this work, we have introduced robustness, accuracy and cumulative distance metrics and methodology that allows us to compare different techniques and approaches in matching brain MRI of different patients or matching MRI brain slice to a position in the brain atlas. To that end, we have used feature detection methods AGAST, AKAZE, BRISK, GFTT, HardNet, and ORB, which are established methods in image processing, and compared them on their resistance to image degradation and their ability to match the same brain MRI slice of different patients. We have demonstrated that some of these techniques can correctly match most of the brain MRI slices of different patients. When matching is performed with the atlas of the human brain, their performance is significantly lower. The best performing feature detection method was a combination of SIFT detector and HardNet descriptor that achieved 93% accuracy in matching images with other patients and only 52% accurately matched images when compared to atlas.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these problems, we propose a novel feature matching method (named R2FD2) that is robust to radiation and rotation differences. Our R2FD2 is conducted in two critical contributions, consisting of a repeatable feature detector and a rotation-invariant feature descriptor. In the first stage, a repeatable feature detector called the Multi-channel Auto-correlation of the Log-Gabor (MALG) is presented for feature detection, which combines the multi-channel auto-correlation strategy with the Log-Gabor wavelets to detect interest points (IPs) with high repeatability and uniform distribution. In the second stage, a rotation-invariant feature descriptor is constructed, named the Rotation-invariant Maximum index map of the Log-Gabor (RMLG), which consists of two components: fast assignment of dominant orientation and construction of feature representation. In the process of fast assignment of dominant orientation, a Rotation-invariant Maximum Index Map (RMIM) is built to address rotation deformations. Then, the proposed RMLG incorporates the rotation-invariant RMIM with the spatial configuration of DAISY to depict a more discriminative feature representation, which improves RMLG's resistance to radiation and rotation variances.Experimental results show that the proposed R2FD2 outperforms five state-of-the-art feature matching methods, and has superior advantages in adaptability and universality. Moreover, our R2FD2 achieves the accuracy of matching within two pixels and has a great advantage in matching efficiency over other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 33 pages, 15 figures | None |

This requires algorithms for real-time, automated spacecraft feature recognition to pinpoint the locations of collision hazards (e.g. solar panels or antennas) and safe docking features (e.g. satellite bodies or thrusters) so safe, effective flightpaths can be planned. Prior work in this area reveals the performance of computer vision models are highly dependent on the training dataset and its coverage of scenarios visually similar to the real scenarios that occur in deployment. Hence, the algorithm may have degraded performance under certain lighting conditions even when the rendezvous maneuver conditions of the chaser to the target spacecraft are the same. This work delves into how humans perform these tasks through a survey of how aerospace engineering students experienced with spacecraft shapes and components recognize features of the three spacecraft: Landsat, Envisat, Anik, and the orbiter Mir. The survey reveals that the most common patterns in the human detection process were to consider the shape and texture of the features: antennas, solar panels, thrusters, and satellite bodies. This work introduces a novel algorithm SpaceYOLO, which fuses a state-of-the-art object detector YOLOv5 with a separate neural network based on these human-inspired decision processes exploiting shape and texture. Performance in autonomous spacecraft detection of SpaceYOLO is compared to ordinary YOLOv5 in hardware-in-the-loop experiments under different lighting and chaser maneuver conditions at the ORION Laboratory at Florida Tech.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Aerospace Conference 2023, 11 pages, 21 figures</p></details> | None |

Prior art has tackled each of these components individually, purportedly aiming to alleviate difficulties in effectively train a holistic network. We design a self-supervised image warping correspondence loss for both feature detection and matching, a weakly-supervised epipolar constraints loss on relative camera pose learning, and a directional matching scheme that detects key-point features in a source image and performs coarse-to-fine correspondence search on the target image. We leverage this framework to enforce cycle consistency in our matching module. In addition, we propose a new loss to robustly handle both definite inlier/outlier matches and less-certain matches. The integration of these learning mechanisms enables end-to-end training of a single network performing all three localization components. Bench-marking our approach on public data-sets, exemplifies how such an end-to-end framework is able to yield more accurate localization that out-performs both traditional methods as well as state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReDFeat: Recoupling Detection and Description for Multimodal Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07439v1)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep-learning-based local feature extraction algorithms that combine detection and description have made significant progress in visible image matching. However, the end-to-end training of such frameworks is notoriously unstable due to the lack of strong supervision of detection and the inappropriate coupling between detection and description. The problem is magnified in cross-modal scenarios, in which most methods heavily rely on the pre-training. In this paper, we recouple independent constraints of detection and description of multimodal feature learning with a mutual weighting strategy, in which the detected probabilities of robust features are forced to peak and repeat, while features with high detection scores are emphasized during optimization. Different from previous works, those weights are detached from back propagation so that the detected probability of indistinct features would not be directly suppressed and the training would be more stable. Moreover, we propose the Super Detector, a detector that possesses a large receptive field and is equipped with learnable non-maximum suppression layers, to fulfill the harsh terms of detection. Finally, we build a benchmark that contains cross visible, infrared, near-infrared and synthetic aperture radar image pairs for evaluating the performance of features in feature matching and image registration tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that features trained with the recoulped detection and description, named ReDFeat, surpass previous state-of-the-arts in the benchmark, while the model can be readily trained from scratch.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deepfake Detection using Biological Features: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05819v1)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfake is a deep learning-based technique that makes it easy to change or modify images and videos. In investigations and court, visual evidence is commonly employed, but these pieces of evidence may now be suspect due to technological advancements in deepfake. Deepfakes have been used to blackmail individuals, plan terrorist attacks, disseminate false information, defame individuals, and foment political turmoil. This study describes the history of deepfake, its development and detection, and the challenges based on physiological measurements such as eyebrow recognition, eye blinking detection, eye movement detection, ear and mouth detection, and heartbeat detection. The study also proposes a scope in this field and compares the different biological features and their classifiers. Deepfakes are created using the generative adversarial network (GANs) model, and were once easy to detect by humans due to visible artifacts. However, as technology has advanced, deepfakes have become highly indistinguishable from natural images, making it important to review detection methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Our main application is in the identification of atomic columns and other features in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cubical persistent homology is used to identify local minima and their size in subregions in the frames of nanoparticle videos, which are hypothesized to correspond to relevant atomic features. We compare the performance of our algorithm to other employed methods for the detection of columns and their intensity. Additionally, Monte Carlo goodness-of-fit testing using real valued summaries of persistence diagrams derived from smoothed images (generated from pixels residing in the vacuum region of an image) is developed and employed to identify whether or not the proposed atomic features generated by our algorithm are due to noise. Using these summaries derived from the generated persistence diagrams, one can produce univariate time series for the nanoparticle videos, thus providing a means for assessing fluxional behavior. A guarantee on the false discovery rate for multiple Monte Carlo testing of identical hypotheses is also established.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 21 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

As its theoretical foundations have been developed, TDA has shown promise in extracting useful information from high-dimensional, noisy, and complex data such as those used in biomedicine. To improve efficiency, these techniques may employ landmark samplers. The heuristic maxmin procedure obtains a roughly even distribution of sample points by implicitly constructing a cover comprising sets of uniform radius. However, issues arise with data that vary in density or include points with multiplicities, as are common in biomedicine. We propose an analogous procedure, "lastfirst" based on ranked distances, which implies a cover comprising sets of uniform cardinality. We first rigorously define the procedure and prove that it obtains landmarks with desired properties. We then perform benchmark tests and compare its performance to that of maxmin, on feature detection and class prediction tasks involving simulated and real-world biomedical data. Lastfirst is more general than maxmin in that it can be applied to any data on which arbitrary (and not necessarily symmetric) pairwise distances can be computed. Lastfirst is more computationally costly, but our implementation scales at the same rate as maxmin. We find that lastfirst achieves comparable performance on prediction tasks and outperforms maxmin on homology detection tasks. Where the numerical values of similarity measures are not meaningful, as in many biomedical contexts, lastfirst sampling may also improve interpretability.</p></details> | 30 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[Large-scale Global Low-rank Optimization for Computational Compressed Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03047v1)** | 2023-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision and computational photography. Most of the conventional optimization and deep learning techniques explore local information for reconstruction. Recently, nonlocal low-rank (NLR) reconstruction has achieved remarkable success in improving accuracy and generalization. However, the computational cost has inhibited NLR from seeking global structural similarity, which consequentially keeps it trapped in the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency and prevents it from high-dimensional large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we report here the global low-rank (GLR) optimization technique, realizing highly-efficient large-scale reconstruction with global self-similarity. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism in deep learning, GLR extracts exemplar image patches by feature detection instead of conventional uniform selection. This directly produces key patches using structural features to avoid burdensome computational redundancy. Further, it performs patch matching across the entire image via neural-based convolution, which produces the global similarity heat map in parallel, rather than conventional sequential block-wise matching. As such, GLR improves patch grouping efficiency by more than one order of magnitude. We experimentally demonstrate GLR's effectiveness on temporal, frequency, and spectral dimensions, including different computational imaging modalities of compressive temporal imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and multispectral filter array demosaicing. This work presents the superiority of inherent fusion of deep learning strategies and iterative optimization, and breaks the persistent dilemma of the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency for various large-scale reconstruction tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Voxelized 3D Feature Aggregation for Multiview Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03471v2)** | 2023-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view detection incorporates multiple camera views to alleviate occlusion in crowded scenes, where the state-of-the-art approaches adopt homography transformations to project multi-view features to the ground plane. However, we find that these 2D transformations do not take into account the object's height, and with this neglection features along the vertical direction of same object are likely not projected onto the same ground plane point, leading to impure ground-plane features. To solve this problem, we propose VFA, voxelized 3D feature aggregation, for feature transformation and aggregation in multi-view detection. Specifically, we voxelize the 3D space, project the voxels onto each camera view, and associate 2D features with these projected voxels. This allows us to identify and then aggregate 2D features along the same vertical line, alleviating projection distortions to a large extent. Additionally, because different kinds of objects (human vs. cattle) have different shapes on the ground plane, we introduce the oriented Gaussian encoding to match such shapes, leading to increased accuracy and efficiency. We perform experiments on multiview 2D detection and multiview 3D detection problems. Results on four datasets (including a newly introduced MultiviewC dataset) show that our system is very competitive compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. %Our code and data will be open-sourced.Code and MultiviewC are released at https://github.com/Robert-Mar/VFA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Robert-Mar/VFA) |

Uncontrollable growth of melanocytes leads to melanoma. Melanoma has been growing wildly in the last few decades. In recent years, the detection of melanoma using image processing techniques has become a dominant research field. The Automatic Melanoma Detection System (AMDS) helps to detect melanoma based on image processing techniques by accepting infected skin area images as input. A single lesion image is a source of multiple features. Therefore, It is crucial to select the appropriate features from the image of the lesion in order to increase the accuracy of AMDS. For melanoma detection, all extracted features are not important. Some of the extracted features are complex and require more computation tasks, which impacts the classification accuracy of AMDS. The feature extraction phase of AMDS exhibits more variability, therefore it is important to study the behaviour of AMDS using individual and extended feature extraction approaches. A novel algorithm ExtFvAMDS is proposed for the calculation of Extended Feature Vector Space. The six models proposed in the comparative study revealed that the HSV feature vector space for automatic detection of melanoma using Ensemble Bagged Tree classifier on Med-Node Dataset provided 99% AUC, 95.30% accuracy, 94.23% sensitivity, and 96.96% specificity.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updations are required</p></details> | None |

Also, when trained with supervised learning, it detects only the cases included in the labels. In real practice, we want to also open to other possibilities than the named cases while examining the medical images. As a solution, the need for anomaly detection that can detect and localize abnormalities by learning the normal characteristics using only normal images is emerging. With medical image data, we can design either 2D or 3D networks of self-supervised learning for anomaly detection task. Although 3D networks, which learns 3D structures of the human body, show good performance in 3D medical image anomaly detection, they cannot be stacked in deeper layers due to memory problems. While 2D networks have advantage in feature detection, they lack 3D context information. In this paper, we develop a method for combining the strength of the 3D network and the strength of the 2D network through joint embedding. We also propose the pretask of self-supervised learning to make it possible for the networks to learn efficiently. Through the experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance in both classification and segmentation tasks compared to the SoTA method.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures | None |

Existing log-based anomaly detection methods usually consist of four main steps: log collection, log parsing, feature extraction, and anomaly detection, wherein the feature extraction step extracts useful features for anomaly detection by counting log events. For a complex system, such as a lithography machine consisting of a large number of subsystems, its log may contain thousands of different events, resulting in abounding extracted features. However, when anomaly detection is performed at the subsystem level, analyzing all features becomes expensive and unnecessary. To mitigate this problem, we develop a feature selection method for log-based anomaly detection and prediction, largely improving the effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a work-in-progress paper that was accepted by the AI for Manufacturing Workshop at ECMLPKDD 2022, with oral presentation \& poster</p></details> | None |

At present, it still has some deficiencies needing further improvement, mainly including the discrimination power of extracted local descriptors, the localization accuracy of detected keypoints, and the efficiency of local feature learning. This paper focuses on promoting the currently popular sparse local feature learning with camera pose supervision. Therefore, it pertinently proposes a Shared Coupling-bridge scheme with four light-weight yet effective improvements for weakly-supervised local feature (SCFeat) learning. It mainly contains: i) the \emph{Feature-Fusion-ResUNet Backbone} (F2R-Backbone) for local descriptors learning, ii) a shared coupling-bridge normalization to improve the decoupling training of description network and detection network, iii) an improved detection network with peakiness measurement to detect keypoints and iv) the fundamental matrix error as a reward factor to further optimize feature detection training. Extensive experiments prove that our SCFeat improvement is effective. It could often obtain a state-of-the-art performance on classic image matching and visual localization. In terms of 3D reconstruction, it could still achieve competitive results.

In this paper, we propose a novel feature learning method in the deep learning framework, referred to as Feature Calibration Network (FC-Net), to adaptively detect pedestrians under various occlusions. FC-Net is based on the observation that the visible parts of pedestrians are selective and decisive for detection, and is implemented as a self-paced feature learning framework with a self-activation (SA) module and a feature calibration (FC) module. In a new self-activated manner, FC-Net learns features which highlight the visible parts and suppress the occluded parts of pedestrians. The SA module estimates pedestrian activation maps by reusing classifier weights, without any additional parameter involved, therefore resulting in an extremely parsimony model to reinforce the semantics of features, while the FC module calibrates the convolutional features for adaptive pedestrian representation in both pixel-wise and region-based ways. Experiments on CityPersons and Caltech datasets demonstrate that FC-Net improves detection performance on occluded pedestrians up to 10% while maintaining excellent performance on non-occluded instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS)</p></details> | None |

Existing methods are unable to adapt to these difficult cases while maintaining acceptable performance. In this paper we propose a novel feature learning model, referred to as CircleNet, to achieve feature adaptation by mimicking the process humans looking at low resolution and occluded objects: focusing on it again, at a finer scale, if the object can not be identified clearly for the first time. CircleNet is implemented as a set of feature pyramids and uses weight sharing path augmentation for better feature fusion. It targets at reciprocating feature adaptation and iterative object detection using multiple top-down and bottom-up pathways. To take full advantage of the feature adaptation capability in CircleNet, we design an instance decomposition training strategy to focus on detecting pedestrian instances of various resolutions and different occlusion levels in each cycle. Specifically, CircleNet implements feature ensemble with the idea of hard negative boosting in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two pedestrian detection datasets, Caltech and CityPersons, show that CircleNet improves the performance of occluded and low-resolution pedestrians with significant margins while maintaining good performance on normal instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS)</p></details> | None |

| **[Feature Aggregation and Propagation Network for Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00990v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to detect/segment camouflaged objects embedded in the environment, which has attracted increasing attention over the past decades. Although several COD methods have been developed, they still suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the intrinsic similarities between the foreground objects and background surroundings. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation and Propagation Network (FAP-Net) for camouflaged object detection. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Guidance Module (BGM) to explicitly model the boundary characteristic, which can provide boundary-enhanced features to boost the COD performance. To capture the scale variations of the camouflaged objects, we propose a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM) to characterize the multi-scale information from each layer and obtain the aggregated feature representations. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-level Fusion and Propagation Module (CFPM). In the CFPM, the feature fusion part can effectively integrate the features from adjacent layers to exploit the cross-level correlations, and the feature propagation part can transmit valuable context information from the encoder to the decoder network via a gate unit. Finally, we formulate a unified and end-to-end trainable framework where cross-level features can be effectively fused and propagated for capturing rich context information.

| **[BALF: Simple and Efficient Blur Aware Local Feature Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14731v2)** | 2022-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local feature detection is a key ingredient of many image processing and computer vision applications, such as visual odometry and localization. Most existing algorithms focus on feature detection from a sharp image. They would thus have degraded performance once the image is blurred, which could happen easily under low-lighting conditions. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet both efficient and effective keypoint detection method that is able to accurately localize the salient keypoints in a blurred image. Our method takes advantages of a novel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based architecture that significantly improve the detection repeatability for a blurred image. The network is also light-weight and able to run in real-time, which enables its deployment for time-constrained applications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our detector is able to improve the detection repeatability with blurred images, while keeping comparable performance as existing state-of-the-art detectors for sharp images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature Analysis for Machine Learning-based IoT Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12732v2)** | 2022-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) networks have become an increasingly attractive target of cyberattacks. Powerful Machine Learning (ML) models have recently been adopted to implement network intrusion detection systems to protect IoT networks. For the successful training of such ML models, selecting the right data features is crucial, maximising the detection accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper comprehensively analyses feature sets' importance and predictive power for detecting network attacks. Three feature selection algorithms: chi-square, information gain and correlation, have been utilised to identify and rank data features. The attributes are fed into two ML classifiers: deep feed-forward and random forest, to measure their attack detection performance. The experimental evaluation considered three datasets: UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and ToN-IoT in their proprietary flow format. In addition, the respective variants in NetFlow format were also considered, i.e., NF-UNSW-NB15, NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and NF-ToN-IoT. The experimental evaluation explored the marginal benefit of adding individual features. Our results show that the accuracy initially increases rapidly with adding features but converges quickly to the maximum. This demonstrates a significant potential to reduce the computational and storage cost of intrusion detection systems while maintaining near-optimal detection accuracy. This has particular relevance in IoT systems, with typically limited computational and storage resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2108.12722</p></details> | None |
| **[Multistep feature aggregation framework for salient object detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06697v1)** | 2022-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on salient object detection have made use of multi-scale features in a way such that high-level features and low-level features can collaborate in locating salient objects. Many of the previous methods have achieved great performance in salient object detection. By merging the high-level and low-level features, a large number of feature information can be extracted. Generally, they are doing these in a one-way framework, and interweaving the variable features all the way to the final feature output. Which may cause some blurring or inaccurate localization of saliency maps. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a multistep feature aggregation (MSFA) framework for salient object detection, which is composed of three modules, including the Diverse Reception (DR) module, multiscale interaction (MSI) module and Feature Enhancement (FE) module to accomplish better multi-level feature fusion. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSFA achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Spatial-Temporal Features for Deepfake Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15872v1)** | 2022-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous research on Deepfake forensics, recent studies have attempted to provide the fine-grained localization of forgeries, in addition to the coarse classification at the video-level. However, the detection and localization performance of existing Deepfake forensic methods still have plenty of room for further improvement. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Deepfake Detection and Localization (ST-DDL) network that simultaneously explores spatial and temporal features for detecting and localizing forged regions. Specifically, we design a new Anchor-Mesh Motion (AMM) algorithm to extract temporal (motion) features by modeling the precise geometric movements of the facial micro-expression. Compared with traditional motion extraction methods (e.g., optical flow) designed to simulate large-moving objects, our proposed AMM could better capture the small-displacement facial features. The temporal features and the spatial features are then fused in a Fusion Attention (FA) module based on a Transformer architecture for the eventual Deepfake forensic tasks. The superiority of our ST-DDL network is verified by experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art competitors, in terms of both video- and pixel-level detection and localization performance. Furthermore, to impel the future development of Deepfake forensics, we build a public forgery dataset consisting of 6000 videos, with many new features such as using widely-used commercial software (e.g., After Effects) for the production, providing online social networks transmitted versions, and splicing multi-source videos. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HighwayWu/ST-DDL.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/HighwayWu/ST-DDL) |
| **[Boosting Out-of-distribution Detection with Typical Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04200v1)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for ensuring the reliability and safety of deep neural networks in real-world scenarios. Different from most previous OOD detection methods that focus on designing OOD scores or introducing diverse outlier examples to retrain the model, we delve into the obstacle factors in OOD detection from the perspective of typicality and regard the feature's high-probability region of the deep model as the feature's typical set. We propose to rectify the feature into its typical set and calculate the OOD score with the typical features to achieve reliable uncertainty estimation. The feature rectification can be conducted as a {plug-and-play} module with various OOD scores. We evaluate the superiority of our method on both the commonly used benchmark (CIFAR) and the more challenging high-resolution benchmark with large label space (ImageNet). Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 5.11$\%$ in the average FPR95 on the ImageNet benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Neural-Statistical Features in Detection of Generative Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07983v1)** | 2022-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection of computer-generated text is an area of rapidly increasing significance as nascent generative models allow for efficient creation of compelling human-like text, which may be abused for the purposes of spam, disinformation, phishing, or online influence campaigns. Past work has studied detection of current state-of-the-art models, but despite a developing threat landscape, there has been minimal analysis of the robustness of detection methods to adversarial attacks. To this end, we evaluate neural and non-neural approaches on their ability to detect computer-generated text, their robustness against text adversarial attacks, and the impact that successful adversarial attacks have on human judgement of text quality. We find that while statistical features underperform neural features, statistical features provide additional adversarial robustness that can be leveraged in ensemble detection models. In the process, we find that previously effective complex phrasal features for detection of computer-generated text hold little predictive power against contemporary generative models, and identify promising statistical features to use instead. Finally, we pioneer the usage of $Δ$MAUVE as a proxy measure for human judgement of adversarial text quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TartanCalib: Iterative Wide-Angle Lens Calibration using Adaptive SubPixel Refinement of AprilTags](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02511v1)** | 2022-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wide-angle cameras are uniquely positioned for mobile robots, by virtue of the rich information they provide in a small, light, and cost-effective form factor. An accurate calibration of the intrinsics and extrinsics is a critical pre-requisite for using the edge of a wide-angle lens for depth perception and odometry. Calibrating wide-angle lenses with current state-of-the-art techniques yields poor results due to extreme distortion at the edge, as most algorithms assume a lens with low to medium distortion closer to a pinhole projection. In this work we present our methodology for accurate wide-angle calibration. Our pipeline generates an intermediate model, and leverages it to iteratively improve feature detection and eventually the camera parameters. We test three key methods to utilize intermediate camera models: (1) undistorting the image into virtual pinhole cameras, (2) reprojecting the target into the image frame, and (3) adaptive subpixel refinement. Combining adaptive subpixel refinement and feature reprojection significantly improves reprojection errors by up to 26.59 %, helps us detect up to 42.01 % more features, and improves performance in the downstream task of dense depth mapping. Finally, TartanCalib is open-source and implemented into an easy-to-use calibration toolbox. We also provide a translation layer with other state-of-the-art works, which allows for regressing generic models with thousands of parameters or using a more robust solver. To this end, TartanCalib is the tool of choice for wide-angle calibration. Project website and code: http://tartancalib.com.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Shrinking unit: a Graph Convolution-Based Unit for CNN-like 3D Point Cloud Feature Extractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12770v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D point clouds have attracted increasing attention in architecture, engineering, and construction due to their high-quality object representation and efficient acquisition methods. Consequently, many point cloud feature detection methods have been proposed in the literature to automate some workflows, such as their classification or part segmentation. Nevertheless, the performance of point cloud automated systems significantly lags behind their image counterparts. While part of this failure stems from the irregularity, unstructuredness, and disorder of point clouds, which makes the task of point cloud feature detection significantly more challenging than the image one, we argue that a lack of inspiration from the image domain might be the primary cause of such a gap. Indeed, given the overwhelming success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image feature detection, it seems reasonable to design their point cloud counterparts, but none of the proposed approaches closely resembles them. Specifically, even though many approaches generalise the convolution operation in point clouds, they fail to emulate the CNNs multiple-feature detection and pooling operations. For this reason, we propose a graph convolution-based unit, dubbed Shrinking unit, that can be stacked vertically and horizontally for the design of CNN-like 3D point cloud feature extractors. Given that self, local and global correlations between points in a point cloud convey crucial spatial geometric information, we also leverage them during the feature extraction process. We evaluate our proposal by designing a feature extractor model for the ModelNet-10 benchmark dataset and achieve 90.64% classification accuracy, demonstrating that our innovative idea is effective.

| **[Sar Ship Detection based on Swin Transformer and Feature Enhancement Feature Pyramid Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10421v1)** | 2022-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the booming of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), CNNs such as VGG-16 and ResNet-50 widely serve as backbone in SAR ship detection. However, CNN based backbone is hard to model long-range dependencies, and causes the lack of enough high-quality semantic information in feature maps of shallow layers, which leads to poor detection performance in complicated background and small-sized ships cases. To address these problems, we propose a SAR ship detection method based on Swin Transformer and Feature Enhancement Feature Pyramid Network (FEFPN). Swin Transformer serves as backbone to model long-range dependencies and generates hierarchical features maps. FEFPN is proposed to further improve the quality of feature maps by gradually enhancing the semantic information of feature maps at all levels, especially feature maps in shallow layers. Experiments conducted on SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) reveal the advantage of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Corpus-Guided Contrast Sets for Morphosyntactic Feature Detection in Low-Resource English Varieties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07611v1)** | 2022-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of language variation examines how language varies between and within different groups of speakers, shedding light on how we use language to construct identities and how social contexts affect language use. A common method is to identify instances of a certain linguistic feature - say, the zero copula construction - in a corpus, and analyze the feature's distribution across speakers, topics, and other variables, to either gain a qualitative understanding of the feature's function or systematically measure variation. In this paper, we explore the challenging task of automatic morphosyntactic feature detection in low-resource English varieties. We present a human-in-the-loop approach to generate and filter effective contrast sets via corpus-guided edits. We show that our approach improves feature detection for both Indian English and African American English, demonstrate how it can assist linguistic research, and release our fine-tuned models for use by other researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Field...</summary><p>Field Matters Workshop at COLING 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[Large-Field Contextual Feature Learning for Glass Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04639v1)** | 2022-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glass is very common in our daily life. Existing computer vision systems neglect it and thus may have severe consequences, e.g., a robot may crash into a glass wall. However, sensing the presence of glass is not straightforward. The key challenge is that arbitrary objects/scenes can appear behind the glass. In this paper, we propose an important problem of detecting glass surfaces from a single RGB image. To address this problem, we construct the first large-scale glass detection dataset (GDD) and propose a novel glass detection network, called GDNet-B, which explores abundant contextual cues in a large field-of-view via a novel large-field contextual feature integration (LCFI) module and integrates both high-level and low-level boundary features with a boundary feature enhancement (BFE) module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GDNet-B achieves satisfying glass detection results on the images within and beyond the GDD testing set. We further validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed GDNet-B by applying it to other vision tasks, including mirror segmentation and salient object detection. Finally, we show the potential applications of glass detection and discuss possible future research directions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SSORN: Self-Supervised Outlier Removal Network for Robust Homography Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14093v1)** | 2022-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional homography estimation pipeline consists of four main steps: feature detection, feature matching, outlier removal and transformation estimation. Recent deep learning models intend to address the homography estimation problem using a single convolutional network. While these models are trained in an end-to-end fashion to simplify the homography estimation problem, they lack the feature matching step and/or the outlier removal step, which are important steps in the traditional homography estimation pipeline. In this paper, we attempt to build a deep learning model that mimics all four steps in the traditional homography estimation pipeline. In particular, the feature matching step is implemented using the cost volume technique. To remove outliers in the cost volume, we treat this outlier removal problem as a denoising problem and propose a novel self-supervised loss to solve the problem. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing deep learning models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ssFPN: Scale Sequence (S^2) Feature Based-Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11533v2)** | 2022-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) has been an essential module for object detection models to consider various scales of an object. However, average precision (AP) on small objects is relatively lower than AP on medium and large objects. The reason is why the deeper layer of CNN causes information loss as feature extraction level. We propose a new scale sequence (S^2) feature extraction of FPN to strengthen feature information of small objects. We consider FPN structure as scale-space and extract scale sequence (S^2) feature by 3D convolution on the level axis of FPN. It is basically scale invariant feature and is built on high-resolution pyramid feature map for small objects. Furthermore, the proposed S^2 feature can be extended to most object detection models based on FPN. We demonstrate the proposed S2 feature can improve the performance of both one-stage and two-stage detectors on MS COCO dataset. Based on the proposed S2 feature, we achieve upto 1.3% and 1.1% of AP improvement for YOLOv4-P5 and YOLOv4-P6, respectively. For Faster RCNN and Mask R-CNN, we observe upto 2.0% and 1.6% of AP improvement with the suggested S^2 feature, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning has led to great advancements in feature detection and description, training and validating data-driven models for space applications is challenging due to the limited availability of large-scale, annotated datasets. This paper introduces AstroVision, a large-scale dataset comprised of 115,970 densely annotated, real images of 16 different small bodies captured during past and ongoing missions. We leverage AstroVision to develop a set of standardized benchmarks and conduct an exhaustive evaluation of both handcrafted and data-driven feature detection and description methods. Next, we employ AstroVision for end-to-end training of a state-of-the-art, deep feature detection and description network and demonstrate improved performance on multiple benchmarks. The full benchmarking pipeline and the dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate the advancement of computer vision algorithms for space applications.</p></details> |  | None |
