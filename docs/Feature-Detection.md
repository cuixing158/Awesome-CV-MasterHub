Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints. Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event camera operation in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables, ICCV Workshop NeVi2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient Surgical Robotic Instrument Pose Reconstruction in Real World Conditions Using Unified Feature Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03532v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions; however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging surgical environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection for Large Language Model Generated Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18862v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection, specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD (Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits (0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 tables, empirical study on multi-feature AI text detection</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient and Accurate Downfacing Visual Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10021v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips (SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods, was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24 pixels/frame.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IoT-J)</p></details> | None |
| **[CLAP: Clustering to Localize Across n Possibilities, A Simple, Robust Geometric Approach in the Presence of Symmetries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08495v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024 adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy. However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence and velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing our robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.</p></details> |  | None |

For univariate, stationary, and isotropic fields, the three controlling parameters are the process variance, smoothness, and range. The debiased Whittle likelihood maximization explicitly treats discretization and edge effects for finite sampled regions in parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. As even the best parameter estimate may not be good enough, we provide a test for whether the model specification itself warrants rejection. Our results are practical and relevant for the study of a variety of geophysical fields, and for spatial interpolation, out-of-sample extension, kriging, machine learning, and feature detection of geological data. We present procedural details and high-level results on real-world examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Geophysical Journal International, August 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DEXTER-LLM: Dynamic and Explainable Coordination of Multi-Robot Systems in Unknown Environments via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14387v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model (LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM) for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i) a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods, simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances, with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

| **[I Have Covered All the Bases Here: Interpreting Reasoning Features in Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18878v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning during generation. However, the internal mechanisms behind these reasoning processes remain unexplored. We observe reasoning LLMs consistently use vocabulary associated with human reasoning processes. We hypothesize these words correspond to specific reasoning moments within the models' internal mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. We introduce ReasonScore, an automatic metric to identify active SAE features during these reasoning moments. We perform manual and automatic interpretation of the features detected by our metric, and find those with activation patterns matching uncertainty, exploratory thinking, and reflection. Through steering experiments, we demonstrate that amplifying these features increases performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks (+2.2%) while producing longer reasoning traces (+20.5%). Using the model diffing technique, we provide evidence that these features are present only in models with reasoning capabilities. Our work provides the first step towards a mechanistic understanding of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning) |
| **[Tobler's First Law in GeoAI: A Spatially Explicit Deep Learning Model for Terrain Feature Detection Under Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03745v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features, in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance. Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets. This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[C-DOG: Multi-View Multi-instance Feature Association Using Connected δ-Overlap Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14095v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-instance feature association constitutes a crucial step in 3D reconstruction, facilitating the consistent grouping of object instances across various camera perspectives. The presence of multiple identical objects within a scene often leads to ambiguities for appearance-based feature matching algorithms. Our work circumvents this challenge by exclusively employing geometrical constraints, specifically epipolar geometry, for feature association. We introduce C-DOG (Connected delta-Overlap Graph), an algorithm designed for robust geometrical feature association, even in the presence of noisy feature detections. In a C-DOG graph, two nodes representing 2D feature points from distinct views are connected by an edge if they correspond to the same 3D point. Each edge is weighted by its epipolar distance. Ideally, true associations yield a zero distance; however, noisy feature detections can result in non-zero values. To robustly retain edges where the epipolar distance is less than a threshold delta, we employ a Szymkiewicz--Simpson coefficient. This process leads to a delta-neighbor-overlap clustering of 2D nodes. Furthermore, unreliable nodes are pruned from these clusters using an Inter-quartile Range (IQR)-based criterion. Our extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG not only outperforms geometry-based baseline algorithms but also remains remarkably robust under demanding conditions. This includes scenes with high object density, no visual features, and restricted camera overlap, positioning C-DOG as an excellent solution for scalable 3D reconstruction in practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Wind Turbine Feature Detection Using Deep Learning and Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21611v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades, accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting, turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted at ICMV 2025</p></details> | None |

Our IBVS system solves numerical instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1) an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11 with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable for real-time onboard deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LOCOFY Large Design Models -- Design to code conversion solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16208v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in Large Language Models and Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous challenges related to interpretability, scalability, resource requirements and repeatability remain, related to their application in the design-to-code space. To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models (LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless conversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions for code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models illustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior performance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning, responsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and feature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in identifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our proposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs that subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable production-ready code.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring the Frontiers of kNN Noisy Feature Detection and Recovery for Self-Driving Labs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16833v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the features used to model system performance, compromising current and future campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and experimental precision in automated materials discovery.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Extension OL-MDISF: Online Learning from Mix-Typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10594v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware pseudo-labeling. This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF. It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling, drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios. These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for online learning on complex, weakly supervised streaming data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[F-Hash: Feature-Based Hash Design for Time-Varying Volume Visualization via Multi-Resolution Tesseract Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03836v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SPACE-SUIT: An Artificial Intelligence Based Chromospheric Feature Extractor and Classifier for SUIT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08589v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses YOLO, a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Solar Physics</p></details> | None |

Carbon cycle extremes represent large anomalies in the carbon cycle that are associated with gains or losses in carbon uptake. Carbon cycle extremes could be continuous in space and time and cross political boundaries. Here, we present a methodology to identify large spatiotemporal extremes (STEs) in the terrestrial carbon cycle using image processing tools for feature detection. We characterized the STE events based on neighborhood structures that are three-dimensional adjacency matrices for the detection of spatiotemporal manifolds of carbon cycle extremes. We found that the area affected and carbon loss during negative carbon cycle extremes were consistent with continuous neighborhood structures. In the gross primary production data we used, 100 carbon cycle STEs accounted for more than 75\% of all the negative carbon cycle extremes. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the magnitude of carbon cycle STEs and attribution of those STEs to climate drivers as a function of neighborhood structures for two observational datasets and an Earth system model simulation.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to AIMC 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Faster than Fast: Accelerating Oriented FAST Feature Detection on Low-end Embedded GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07164v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality, which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over 7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Although onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in challenging lighting conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Handling petabyte-scale image data requires high-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely used for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization, especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 column IEEE format, 13 Figures</p></details> | None |

However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens. Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature detection.

Due to the high volume of data generated, an automated and reliable biomarker detection pipeline is necessary as a primary screening stage. We outline our new state-of-the-art pipeline for identifying biomarkers from OCT scans. In collaboration with trained ophthalmologists, we identify local and global structures in biomarkers. Through a comprehensive and systematic review of existing vision architectures, we evaluate different convolution and attention mechanisms for biomarker detection. We find that MaxViT, a hybrid vision transformer combining convolution layers with strided attention, is better suited for local feature detection, while EVA-02, a standard vision transformer leveraging pure attention and large-scale knowledge distillation, excels at capturing global features. We ensemble the predictions of both models to achieve first place in the IEEE Video and Image Processing Cup 2023 competition on OCT biomarker detection, achieving a patient-wise F1 score of 0.8527 in the final phase of the competition, scoring 3.8\% higher than the next best solution. Finally, we used knowledge distillation to train a single MaxViT to outperform our ensemble at a fraction of the computation cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks remains a challenge for their reliable deployment in applications, such as navigation of autonomous agents. Even though CNN-based SLAM algorithms are a growing area of research there is a notable absence of a comprehensive presentation and examination of adversarial attacks targeting CNN-based feature detectors, as part of a SLAM system. Our work introduces black-box adversarial perturbations applied to the RGB images fed into the GCN-SLAM algorithm. Our findings on the TUM dataset [30] reveal that even attacks of moderate scale can lead to tracking failure in as many as 76% of the frames. Moreover, our experiments highlight the catastrophic impact of attacking depth instead of RGB input images on the SLAM system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures | None |

Classical vs Learned Image Matching for Mobile Mapping Cameras to Textured Semantic 3D Building Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17973v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion, and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions. Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual localization methods.

While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.</p></details> |  | None |

Their assessment is presently either limited to morphometric properties of their mass skeleton or requires labor-intensive qualitative evaluations of visually perceived qualities. This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative Artificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban scenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates OpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version of the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via customizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated mapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street levels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without task-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting scalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments. Two exploratory case studies in Nice and Vienna illustrate SAGAI's capacity to produce geospatial outputs from vision-language inference. The initial results show strong performance for binary urban-rural scene classification, moderate precision in commercial feature detection, and lower estimates, but still informative, of sidewalk width. Fully deployable by any user, SAGAI can be easily adapted to a wide range of urban research themes, such as walkability, safety, or urban design, through prompt modification alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures in main paper, 6 figures in appendices</p></details> | None |
| **[A New Graph Grammar Formalism for Robust Syntactic Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15975v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I introduce a formalism for representing the syntax of recursively structured graph-like patterns. It does not use production rules, like a conventional graph grammar, but represents the syntactic structure in a more direct and declarative way. The grammar and the pattern are both represented as networks, and parsing is seen as the construction of a homomorphism from the pattern to the grammar. The grammars can represent iterative, hierarchical and nested recursive structure in more than one dimension. This supports a highly parallel style of parsing, in which all aspects of pattern recognition (feature detection, segmentation, parsing, filling in missing symbols, top-down and bottom-up inference) are integrated into a single process, to exploit the synergy between them. The emphasis of this paper is on underlying theoretical issues, but I also give some example runs to illustrate the error-tolerant parsing of complex recursively structured patterns of 50-1000 symbols, involving variability in geometric relationships, blurry and indistinct symbols, overlapping symbols, cluttered images, and erased patches.</p></details> | 64 pages, 23 figures | None |

Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest in robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While traditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down when faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning methods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain constrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational demands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves beyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively. Instead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion signatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal motion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve natural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while remaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also requires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature detection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence enables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Their novelty compared to standard cameras lies in the transition from capturing full picture frames at fixed time intervals to a sparse data format which, with its distinctive qualities, offers potential improvements in various applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of reinventing algorithmic procedures or adapting them to effectively process the new data format. In this survey, we systematically examine neuromorphic vision along three main dimensions. First, we highlight the technological evolution and distinctive hardware features of neuromorphic cameras from their inception to recent models. Second, we review image processing algorithms developed explicitly for event-based data, covering key works on feature detection, tracking, and optical flow -which form the basis for analyzing image elements and transformations -as well as depth and pose estimation or object recognition, which interpret more complex scene structures and components. These techniques, drawn from classical computer vision and modern data-driven approaches, are examined to illustrate the breadth of applications for event-based cameras. Third, we present practical application case studies demonstrating how event cameras have been successfully used across various industries and scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges limiting widespread adoption, identify significant research gaps compared to standard imaging techniques, and outline promising future directions and opportunities that neuromorphic vision offers.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages total, 26 without references, two images and five tables.

Vision transformer models show good accuracy on large scale datasets, with features of multi-modal training. Due to their promising feature detection, we aim to explore vision transformer models for diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma versus classical Hodgkin lymphoma using pathology whole slide images of HE slides. We compared the classification performance of the vision transformer to our previously designed convolutional neural network on the same dataset. The dataset includes whole slide images of HE slides for 20 cases, including 10 cases in each diagnostic category. From each whole slide image, 60 image patches having size of 100 by 100 pixels and at magnification of 20 were obtained to yield 1200 image patches, from which 90 percent were used for training, 9 percent for validation, and 10 percent for testing. The test results from the convolutional neural network model had previously shown an excellent diagnostic accuracy of 100 percent. The test results from the vision transformer model also showed a comparable accuracy at 100 percent. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of predictive performance between a vision transformer model and a convolutional neural network model using the same dataset of lymphoma. Overall, convolutional neural network has a more mature architecture than vision transformer and is usually the best choice when large scale pretraining is not an available option. Nevertheless, our current study shows comparable and excellent accuracy of vision transformer compared to that of convolutional neural network even with a relatively small dataset of anaplastic large cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for high-precision localization using affordable hardware, bridging the gap between consumer-grade sensors and production-level performance requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IV'25</p></details> | None |

As opposed to frame-based cameras, the motion-dependent nature of event cameras presents persistent challenges in achieving robust event feature detection and matching. In recent years, learning-based approaches have demonstrated superior robustness over traditional handcrafted methods in feature detection and matching, particularly under aggressive motion and HDR scenarios. In this paper, we propose SuperEIO, a novel framework that leverages the learning-based event-only detection and IMU measurements to achieve event-inertial odometry. Our event-only feature detection employs a convolutional neural network under continuous event streams. Moreover, our system adopts the graph neural network to achieve event descriptor matching for loop closure. The proposed system utilizes TensorRT to accelerate the inference speed of deep networks, which ensures low-latency processing and robust real-time operation on resource-limited platforms. Besides, we evaluate our method extensively on multiple public datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art event-based methods.

While visual enhancement can improve contrast and clarity, it may introduce visual-tolerant artifacts that obscure the structural integrity of images. Considering the resilience of semantic information against environmental interference, we propose a semantic-driven feature enhancement network for robust homography estimation, dubbed SeFENet. Concretely, we first introduce an innovative hierarchical scale-aware module to expand the receptive field by aggregating multi-scale information, thereby effectively extracting image features under diverse harsh conditions. Subsequently, we propose a semantic-guided constraint module combined with a high-level perceptual framework to achieve degradation-tolerant with semantic feature. A meta-learning-based training strategy is introduced to mitigate the disparity between semantic and structural features. By internal-external alternating optimization, the proposed network achieves implicit semantic-wise feature enhancement, thereby improving the robustness of homography estimation in adverse environments by strengthening the local feature comprehension and context information extraction. Experimental results under both normal and harsh conditions demonstrate that SeFENet significantly outperforms SOTA methods, reducing point match error by at least 41% on the large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the intrinsic complexity of LLMs, effective prompting is more challenging than it may seem. This highlights the need for innovative educational and support strategies that are both widely accessible and seamlessly integrated into task workflows. Yet, LLM prompting is highly task- and domain-dependent, limiting the effectiveness of generic approaches. In this study, we explore whether LLM-based methods can facilitate learning assessments by using ad-hoc guidelines and a minimal number of annotated prompt samples. Our framework transforms these guidelines into features that can be identified within learners' prompts. Using these feature descriptions and annotated examples, we create few-shot learning detectors. We then evaluate different configurations of these detectors, testing three state-of-the-art LLMs and ensembles. We run experiments with cross-validation on a sample of original prompts, as well as tests on prompts collected from task-naive learners. Our results show how LLMs perform on feature detection. Notably, GPT- 4 demonstrates strong performance on most features, while closely related models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo (Instruct), show inconsistent behaviors in feature classification. These differences highlight the need for further research into how design choices impact feature selection and prompt detection. Our findings contribute to the fields of generative AI literacy and computer-supported learning assessment, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for Publication in Educational Technology & Society (ET&S)</p></details> | None |

Our system adopts a hybrid approach that combines deep learning techniques for feature detection and matching with traditional backend optimization methods. Specifically, we propose a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously extracts keypoints and structural lines. These features are then associated, matched, triangulated, and optimized in a coupled manner.

Within this context, the simultaneous detection of significant features and groups aimed at a specific response with false discovery rate (FDR) control stands as a crucial issue, such as the spatial genome-wide association studies. Existing methods typically require maintaining the same detection approach at different resolutions to achieve multilayer FDR control, which may be not efficient. For instance, it is unsuitable to apply knockoff method to detect features with high correlations, therefore, the efficiency of multilayer knockoff filter (MKF) is also not guaranteed. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel method of derandomized flexible e-filter procedure (DFEFP) by developing generalized e-values. This method utilizes a wide variety of base detection procedures that operate effectively across various resolutions to provide stable and consistent results, while controlling the false discovery rate at multiple resolutions simultaneously. Furthermore, we investigate the statistical properties of the DFEFP, encompassing multilayer FDR control, stability guarantee, and solution correctness of algorithm. The DFEFP is initially exemplified to construct an e-value data splitting filter (eDS-filter). Subsequently, the eDS-filter in combination with the group knockoff filter (gKF) is used to develop more flexible methodology which referred to as the eDS+gKF-filter. Simulation studies demonstrate that the eDS+gKF-filter effectively controls FDR at multiple resolutions while either maintaining or enhancing power compared to MKF. The superiority of the eDS+gKF-filter is also demonstrated through the analysis of HIV mutation data.</p></details> |  | None |

Reviewing endoscopy videos often involves frequent adjustments and reorientations to piece together a complete view, which can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. Image stitching techniques address this issue by providing a continuous and complete visualization of the examined area. However, endoscopic images, particularly those of the esophagus, present unique challenges. The smooth surface, lack of distinct feature points, and non-horizontal orientation complicate the stitching process, rendering traditional feature-based methods often ineffective for these types of images. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing pipeline designed to enhance endoscopic image stitching through advanced computational techniques. Our approach converts endoscopic video data into continuous 2D images by following four key steps: (1) keyframe selection, (2) image rotation adjustment to correct distortions, (3) surface unwrapping using polar coordinate transformation to generate a flat image, and (4) feature point matching enhanced by Adaptive Histogram Equalization for improved feature detection. We evaluate stitching quality through the assessment of valid feature point match pairs. Experiments conducted on 20 pediatric endoscopy videos demonstrate that our method significantly improves image alignment and stitching quality compared to traditional techniques, laying a robust foundation for more effective panoramic image creation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their transformative potential, current SDL implementations rely on rigid, predefined protocols that limit their adaptability to dynamic experimental scenarios across different labs. A significant challenge persists in measuring how effectively AI agents can replicate the adaptive decision-making and experimental intuition of expert scientists. Here, we introduce AILA (Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant), a framework that automates atomic force microscopy (AFM) through LLM-driven agents. Using AFM as an experimental testbed, we develop AFMBench-a comprehensive evaluation suite that challenges AI agents based on language models like GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 to perform tasks spanning the scientific workflow: from experimental design to results analysis. Our systematic assessment shows that state-of-the-art language models struggle even with basic tasks such as documentation retrieval, leading to a significant decline in performance in multi-agent coordination scenarios. Further, we observe that LLMs exhibit a tendency to not adhere to instructions or even divagate to additional tasks beyond the original request, raising serious concerns regarding safety alignment aspects of AI agents for SDLs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of AILA on increasingly complex experiments open-ended experiments: automated AFM calibration, high-resolution feature detection, and mechanical property measurement. Our findings emphasize the necessity for stringent benchmarking protocols before deploying AI agents as laboratory assistants across scientific disciplines.</p></details> |  | None |

Using aerial and ground imaging over a time series, we develop a framework for characterizing the ripening process of cranberry crops, a crucial component for precision agriculture tasks such as comparing crop breeds (high-throughput phenotyping) and detecting disease. Using drone imaging, we capture images from 20 waypoints across multiple bogs, and using ground-based imaging (hand-held camera), we image same bog patch using fixed fiducial markers. Both imaging methods are repeated to gather a multi-week time series spanning the entire growing season. Aerial imaging provides multiple samples to compute a distribution of albedo values. Ground imaging enables tracking of individual berries for a detailed view of berry appearance changes. Using vision transformers (ViT) for feature detection after segmentation, we extract a high dimensional feature descriptor of berry appearance. Interpretability of appearance is critical for plant biologists and cranberry growers to support crop breeding decisions (e.g.\ comparison of berry varieties from breeding programs). For interpretability, we create a 2D manifold of cranberry appearance by using a UMAP dimensionality reduction on ViT features. This projection enables quantification of ripening paths and a useful metric of ripening rate. We demonstrate the comparison of four cranberry varieties based on our ripening assessments. This work is the first of its kind and has future impact for cranberries and for other crops including wine grapes, olives, blueberries, and maize.

A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses You Only Look Once(YOLO), a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automatic Image Annotation for Mapped Features Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10438v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting road features is a key enabler for autonomous driving and localization. For instance, a reliable detection of poles which are widespread in road environments can improve localization. Modern deep learning-based perception systems need a significant amount of annotated data. Automatic annotation avoids time-consuming and costly manual annotation. Because automatic methods are prone to errors, managing annotation uncertainty is crucial to ensure a proper learning process. Fusing multiple annotation sources on the same dataset can be an efficient way to reduce the errors. This not only improves the quality of annotations, but also improves the learning of perception models. In this paper, we consider the fusion of three automatic annotation methods in images: feature projection from a high accuracy vector map combined with a lidar, image segmentation and lidar segmentation. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of multi-modal automatic annotation for pole detection through a comparative evaluation on manually annotated images. Finally, the resulting multi-modal fusion is used to fine-tune an object detection model for pole base detection using unlabeled data, showing overall improvements achieved by enhancing network specialization.

We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/weitong8591/vop.git.</p></details> | WACV 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/weitong8591/vop.git) |
| **[Construction of generalized samplets in Banach spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00954v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, samplets have been introduced as localized discrete signed measures which are tailored to an underlying data set. Samplets exhibit vanishing moments, i.e., their measure integrals vanish for all polynomials up to a certain degree, which allows for feature detection and data compression. In the present article, we extend the different construction steps of samplets to functionals in Banach spaces more general than point evaluations. To obtain stable representations, we assume that these functionals form frames with square-summable coefficients or even Riesz bases with square-summable coefficients. In either case, the corresponding analysis operator is injective and we obtain samplet bases with the desired properties by means of constructing an isometry of the analysis operator's image. Making the assumption that the dual of the Banach space under consideration is imbedded into the space of compactly supported distributions, the multilevel hierarchy for the generalized samplet construction is obtained by spectral clustering of a similarity graph for the functionals' supports. Based on this multilevel hierarchy, generalized samplets exhibit vanishing moments with respect to a given set of primitives within the Banach space. We derive an abstract localization result for the generalized samplet coefficients with respect to the samplets' support sizes and the approximability of the Banach space elements by the chosen primitives. Finally, we present three examples showcasing the generalized samplet framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Our system consists of 1) a front-end mapping pipeline using a zero-shot segmentation model to extract object masks from images and track them across frames and 2) a frame alignment pipeline that uses the geometric consistency of object relationships to efficiently localize across a variety of conditions. We evaluate SOS-Match on the Batvik seasonal dataset which includes drone flights collected over a coastal plot of southern Finland during different seasons and lighting conditions. Results show that our approach is more robust to changes in lighting and appearance than classical image feature-based approaches or global descriptor methods, and it provides more viewpoint invariance than learning-based feature detection and description approaches. SOS-Match localizes within a reference map up to 46x faster than other feature-based approaches and has a map size less than 0.5% the size of the most compact other maps. SOS-Match is a promising new approach for landmark detection and correspondence search in unstructured environments that is robust to changes in lighting and appearance and is more computationally efficient than other approaches, suggesting that the geometric arrangement of segments is a valuable localization cue in unstructured environments. We release our datasets at https://acl.mit.edu/SOS-Match/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

Using robust augmentations and 5-fold cross-validation, we trained two vision transformer-based models: MaxViT and EVA-02, and ensembled them at inference time. We find MaxViT's use of convolution layers followed by strided attention to be better suited for local feature detection while EVA-02's use of normal attention mechanism and knowledge distillation is better for detecting global features. Our solution brought us the champion title of the IEEE SPS Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup 2023, achieving a patient-wise F1 score of 0.814 in the first phase and 0.8527 in the second and final phase of the competition, scoring 3.8% higher than the next best solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ablat...</summary><p>Ablation study results leveraging pseudolabels added in section 3.9</p></details> | None |
| **[MapSAM: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Automated Feature Detection in Historical Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06971v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated feature detection in historical maps can significantly accelerate the reconstruction of the geospatial past. However, this process is often constrained by the time-consuming task of manually digitizing sufficient high-quality training data. The emergence of visual foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offers a promising solution due to their remarkable generalization capabilities and rapid adaptation to new data distributions. Despite this, directly applying SAM in a zero-shot manner to historical map segmentation poses significant challenges, including poor recognition of certain geospatial features and a reliance on input prompts, which limits its ability to be fully automated. To address these challenges, we introduce MapSAM, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts SAM into a prompt-free and versatile solution for various downstream historical map segmentation tasks. Specifically, we employ Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the image encoder. Additionally, we develop an automatic prompt generation process, eliminating the need for manual input. We further enhance the positional prompt in SAM, transforming it into a higher-level positional-semantic prompt, and modify the cross-attention mechanism in the mask decoder with masked attention for more effective feature aggregation. The proposed MapSAM framework demonstrates promising performance across two distinct historical map segmentation tasks: one focused on linear features and the other on areal features. Experimental results show that it adapts well to various features, even when fine-tuned with extremely limited data (e.g. 10 shots).</p></details> |  | None |

However, the noise generated by drone propellers has emerged as a significant concern. This may affect the public willingness to implement these vehicles in services that require operation in proximity to residential areas. The standard approaches to address this challenge include sound pressure measurements and noise characteristic analyses. The integration of Artificial Intelligence models in recent years has further streamlined the process by enhancing complex feature detection in drone acoustics data. This study builds upon prior research by examining the efficacy of various Deep Learning models in predicting Psychoacoustic Annoyance, an effective index for measuring perceived annoyance by human ears, based on multiple drone characteristics as input. This is accomplished by constructing a training dataset using precise measurements of various drone models with multiple microphones and analyzing flight data, maneuvers, drone physical characteristics, and perceived annoyance under realistic conditions. The aim of this research is to improve our understanding of drone noise, aid in the development of noise reduction techniques, and encourage the acceptance of drone usage on public spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 10 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> | None |

We evaluate these methods using low (128x128) and high-resolution (1024x1024) lunar image patches, providing insights into their performance across scales in challenging extraterrestrial environments. IntFeat combines high-level features from SIFT and low-level features from ORB into a single vector space for robust lunar image registration. We introduce SyncVision, a Python package that compares lunar images using various registration methods, including SIFT, ORB, and IntFeat. Our analysis includes upscaling low-resolution lunar images using bi-linear and bi-cubic interpolation, offering a unique perspective on registration effectiveness across scales and feature detectors in lunar landscapes.

To validate the convergence of the Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) algorithm, real-world experiments utilizing fiducial markers for feature detection are conducted before designing the CNN-based feature detector. To address the limitations of fiducial markers, the novel feature detector focuses on extracting keypoints that represent the corners of a more realistic object compared to fiducial markers. A dataset is generated from sample data captured by the camera mounted on the robot end-effector while the robot operates randomly in the task space. The samples are automatically labeled, and the dataset size is increased by flipping and rotation. The CNN model is developed by modifying the VGG-19 pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. While the weights in the base model remain fixed, the fully connected layer's weights are updated to minimize the mean absolute error, defined based on the deviation of predictions from the real pixel coordinates of the corners. The model undergoes two modifications: replacing max-pooling with average-pooling in the base model and implementing an adaptive learning rate that decreases during epochs. These changes lead to a 50 percent reduction in validation loss. Finally, the trained model's reliability is assessed through k-fold cross-validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE 2024)</p></details> | None |

Despite advancements in enhancing the robustness of visual features, no existing method measures the utility of visual information before processing by specific feature-type algorithms. To address this gap, we introduce PIXER and the concept of "Featureness," which reflects the inherent interest and reliability of visual information for robust recognition, independent of any specific feature type. Leveraging a generalization on Bayesian learning, our approach quantifies both the probability and uncertainty of a pixel's contribution to robust visual utility in a single-shot process, avoiding costly operations such as Monte Carlo sampling and permitting customizable featureness definitions adaptable to a wide range of applications. We evaluate PIXER on visual odometry with featureness selectivity, achieving an average of 31% improvement in RMSE trajectory with 49% fewer features.</p></details> |  | None |

Many recent architectures, most prominently Large Language Models, have to be trained using supercomputers with thousands of accelerators, such as GPUs or TPUs. Next to the vast number of floating point operations the memory footprint of DNNs is also exploding. In contrast, GPU architectures are notoriously short on memory. Even comparatively small architectures like some EfficientNet variants cannot be trained on a single consumer-grade GPU at reasonable mini-batch sizes. During training, intermediate input activations have to be stored until backpropagation for gradient calculation. These make up the vast majority of the memory footprint. In this work we therefore consider compressing activation maps for the backward pass using pooling, which can reduce both the memory footprint and amount of data movement. The forward computation remains uncompressed. We empirically show convergence and study effects on feature detection at the example of the common vision architecture ResNet. With this approach we are able to reduce the peak memory consumption by 29% at the cost of a longer training schedule, while maintaining prediction accuracy compared to an uncompressed baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ITEM workshop co-located with ECML PKDD 2024, Vilnius LT</p></details> | None |

The key challenges include non-uniform lighting and poor visibility in turbid environments. High-frequency forward-look sonar cameras address these issues, by providing high-resolution imagery at maximum range of tens of meters, despite complexities posed by high degree of speckle noise, and lack of color and texture. In particular, robust feature detection is an essential initial step for automated object recognition, localization, navigation, and 3-D mapping. Various local feature detectors developed for RGB images are not well-suited for sonar data. To assess their performances, we evaluate a number of feature detectors using real sonar images from five different sonar devices. Performance metrics such as detection accuracy, false positives, and robustness to variations in target characteristics and sonar devices are applied to analyze the experimental results. The study would provide a deeper insight into the bottlenecks of feature detection for sonar data, and developing more effective methods</p></details> |  | None |

Typically, reconstruction algorithms first identify common features across images and then minimize reconstruction errors after estimating the shape of the terrain. This bundle adjustment (BA) step optimizes around a single, simplifying scalar value that obfuscates many possible causes of reconstruction errors (e.g., initial estimate of the position and orientation of the camera, lighting conditions, ease of feature detection in the terrain). Reconstruction errors can lead to inaccurate scientific inferences or endanger a spacecraft exploring a remote environment. To address this challenge, we present VECTOR, a visual analysis tool that improves error inspection for stereo reconstruction BA. VECTOR provides analysts with previously unavailable visibility into feature locations, camera pose, and computed 3D points. VECTOR was developed in partnership with the Perseverance Mars Rover and Ingenuity Mars Helicopter terrain reconstruction team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We report on how this tool was used to debug and improve terrain reconstruction for the Mars 2020 mission.</p></details> |  | None |

We addressed these challenges by creating a physics-based synthetic image and data generator, resulting in a machine learning model that achieves comparable precision (0.86), recall (0.63), F1 scores (0.71), and engineering property predictions (R2=0.82) to a model trained on human-labeled data. We enhanced both models by using feature prediction confidence scores to derive an image-wide confidence metric, enabling simple thresholding to eliminate ambiguous and out-of-domain images resulting in performance boosts of 5-30% with a filtering-out rate of 25%. Our study demonstrates that synthetic data can eliminate human reliance in ML and provides a means for domain awareness in cases where many feature detections per image are needed.</p></details> |  | None |

Our model draws on the success of previous learning-based feature detection and description methods. To better leverage unlabeled data and constrain the model to reproduce relevant keypoints, we integrate a keypoint-based segmentation task. It is trained in a self-supervised manner by enforcing segmentation consistency between different augmentations of the same image. By incorporating a keypoint augmented self-supervised layer, we achieve robust feature extraction across modalities.

| **[Segment Anything Model is a Good Teacher for Local Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16992v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local feature detection and description play an important role in many computer vision tasks, which are designed to detect and describe keypoints in "any scene" and "any downstream task". Data-driven local feature learning methods need to rely on pixel-level correspondence for training, which is challenging to acquire at scale, thus hindering further improvements in performance. In this paper, we propose SAMFeat to introduce SAM (segment anything model), a fundamental model trained on 11 million images, as a teacher to guide local feature learning and thus inspire higher performance on limited datasets. To do so, first, we construct an auxiliary task of Attention-weighted Semantic Relation Distillation (ASRD), which distillates feature relations with category-agnostic semantic information learned by the SAM encoder into a local feature learning network, to improve local feature description using semantic discrimination. Second, we develop a technique called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning Based on Semantic Grouping (WSC), which utilizes semantic groupings derived from SAM as weakly supervised signals, to optimize the metric space of local descriptors. Third, we design an Edge Attention Guidance (EAG) to further improve the accuracy of local feature detection and description by prompting the network to pay more attention to the edge region guided by SAM. SAMFeat's performance on various tasks such as image matching on HPatches, and long-term visual localization on Aachen Day-Night showcases its superiority over previous local features.

Nevertheless, the lack of focus on user intention type in queries affected the efficiency of QP in prevailing works. Thus, by using a Contextual Fuzzy Linguistic Inference System (CFLIS), this work analyzed the informational, navigational, and transactional-based intents in queries for enhanced QP. Primarily, the user query is parsed using tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, stemming, and POS tagging and then expanded using the WordNet technique. After expanding the queries, to enhance query understanding and to facilitate more accurate analysis and retrieval in query processing, the named entity is recognized using Bidirectional Encoder UnispecNorm Representations from Transformers (BEUNRT). Next, for efficient QP and retrieval of query information from the semantic cache database, the data is structured using Epanechnikov Kernel-Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (EK-OPTICS). The features are extracted from the structured data. Now, sentence type is identified and intent keywords are extracted from the parsed query. Next, the extracted features, detected intents and structured data are inputted to the Multi-head Gated Recurrent Learnable Attention Unit (MGR-LAU), which processes the query based on a semantic cache database (stores previously interpreted queries to expedite effective future searches). Moreover, the query is processed with a minimum latency of 12856ms. Lastly, the Semantic Similarity (SS) is analyzed between the retrieved query and the inputted user query, which continues until the similarity reaches 0.9 and above. Thus, the proposed work surpassed the previous methodologies.</p></details> | 10 Pages. Preprint | None |

However, processing the event data requires either using expensive feature descriptors to transform spikes into frames, or using spiking neural networks that are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a neural network architecture, Reservoir Nodes-enabled neuromorphic vision sensing Network (RN-Net), based on simple convolution layers integrated with dynamic temporal encoding reservoirs for local and global spatiotemporal feature detection with low hardware and training costs. The RN-Net allows efficient processing of asynchronous temporal features, and achieves the highest accuracy of 99.2% for DVS128 Gesture reported to date, and one of the highest accuracy of 67.5% for DVS Lip dataset at a much smaller network size. By leveraging the internal device and circuit dynamics, asynchronous temporal feature encoding can be implemented at very low hardware cost without preprocessing and dedicated memory and arithmetic units. The use of simple DNN blocks and standard backpropagation-based training rules further reduces implementation costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

This capacity is widely studied in the visual domain using the Raven's Progressive Matrices. Recent advances in deep learning have led to multiple artificial neural network models matching or even surpassing human performance. However, while humans can identify and express the rule underlying these tasks with little to no exposure, contemporary neural networks often rely on massive pattern-based training and cannot express or extrapolate the rule inferred from the task. Furthermore, most Raven's Progressive Matrices or Raven-like tasks used for neural network training used symbolic representations, whereas humans can flexibly switch between symbolic and continuous perceptual representations. In this work, we present an algorithmic approach to rule detection and application using feature detection, affine transformation estimation and search. We applied our model to a simplified Raven's Progressive Matrices task, previously designed for behavioral testing and neuroimaging in humans. The model exhibited one-shot learning and achieved near human-level performance in the symbolic reasoning condition of the simplified task. Furthermore, the model can express the relationships discovered and generate multi-step predictions in accordance with the underlying rule. Finally, the model can reason using continuous patterns. We discuss our results and their relevance to studying abstract reasoning in humans, as well as their implications for improving intelligent machines.</p></details> |  | None |

Since it is not straightforward for applications to extract information on temporal redundancy from the compressed video representations, we propose a novel system which conveys temporal redundancy within a sparse decompressed representation. We leverage a video representation framework called ADDER to transcode framed videos to sparse, asynchronous intensity samples. We introduce mechanisms for content adaptation, lossy compression, and asynchronous forms of classical vision algorithms. We evaluate our system on the VIRAT surveillance video dataset, and we show a median 43.7% speed improvement in FAST feature detection compared to OpenCV. We run the same algorithm as OpenCV, but only process pixels that receive new asynchronous events, rather than process every pixel in an image frame.

In this work, we show that both standard SIR sampling and rejection-based optimal sampling are suitable for efficient (10 to 20 ms) real-time pose tracking without feature detection that is using raw point clouds from a 3D LiDAR. Motivated by the large amount of information captured by these sensors, we perform a systematic statistical analysis of how many points are actually required to reach an optimal ratio between efficiency and positioning accuracy. Furthermore, initialization from adverse conditions, e.g., poor GPS signal in urban canyons, we also identify the optimal particle filter settings required to ensure convergence. Our findings include that a decimation factor between 100 and 200 on incoming point clouds provides a large savings in computational cost with a negligible loss in localization accuracy for a VLP-16 scanner. Furthermore, an initial density of $\sim$2 particles/m$^2$ is required to achieve 100% convergence success for large-scale ($\sim$100,000 m$^2$), outdoor global localization without any additional hint from GPS or magnetic field sensors.

This approximation class replaces the associated density with the composition of: (i) a feature map that identifies the leading principal components or features of the target measure, relative to the reference, and (ii) a low-dimensional profile function. When the reference measure satisfies a subspace $\phi$-Sobolev inequality, we construct a computationally tractable approximation that yields certifiable error guarantees with respect to the Amari $\alpha$-divergences. Our construction proceeds in two stages. First, for any feature map and any $\alpha$-divergence, we obtain an analytical expression for the optimal profile function. Second, for linear feature maps, the principal features are obtained from eigenvectors of a matrix involving gradients of the log-density. Neither step requires explicit access to normalizing constants. Notably, by leveraging the $\phi$-Sobolev inequalities, we demonstrate that these features universally certify approximation errors across the range of $\alpha$-divergences $\alpha \in (0,1]$. We then propose an application to Bayesian inverse problems and provide an analogous construction with approximation guarantees that hold in expectation over the data. We conclude with an extension of the proposed dimension reduction strategy to nonlinear feature maps.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Bernoulli, but this version contains both the main file and the supplementary material</p></details> | None |

For time-series simulations and experiments, their data often need to be decimated over timesteps to accommodate storage and I/O limitations. In this paper, we propose a technique that addresses storage costs while improving post-analysis accuracy through spatiotemporal adaptive, error-controlled lossy compression. We investigate the trade-off between data precision and temporal output rates, revealing that reducing data precision and increasing timestep frequency lead to more accurate analysis outcomes. Additionally, we integrate spatiotemporal feature detection with data compression and demonstrate that performing adaptive error-bounded compression in higher dimensional space enables greater compression ratios, leveraging the error propagation theory of a transformation-based compressor. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments using the well-known E3SM climate simulation code and apply our method to compress variables used for cyclone tracking. Our results show a significant reduction in storage size while enhancing the quality of cyclone tracking analysis, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in comparison to the prevalent timestep decimation approach. Compared to three state-of-the-art lossy compressors lacking feature preservation capabilities, our adaptive compression framework improves perfectly matched cases in TC tracking by 26.4-51.3% at medium compression ratios and by 77.3-571.1% at large compression ratios, with a merely 5-11% computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 figures, 2023 IEEE International Conference on e-Science and Grid Computing</p></details> | None |

In particular, dendritic branches play a key role in temporal signal processing and feature detection, using coincidence detection (CD) mechanisms, made possible by the presence of synaptic delays that align temporally disparate inputs for effective integration. Computational studies on spiking neural networks further highlight the significance of delays for CD operations, enabling spatio-temporal pattern recognition within feed-forward neural networks without the need for recurrent architectures. In this work, we present DenRAM, the first realization of a spiking neural network with analog dendritic circuits, integrated into a 130nm technology node coupled with resistive memory (RRAM) technology. DenRAM's dendritic circuits use the RRAM devices to implement both delays and synaptic weights in the network. By configuring the RRAM devices to reproduce bio-realistic timescales, and through exploiting their heterogeneity, we experimentally demonstrate DenRAM's capability to replicate synaptic delay profiles, and efficiently implement CD for spatio-temporal pattern recognition. To validate the architecture, we conduct comprehensive system-level simulations on two representative temporal benchmarks, highlighting DenRAM's resilience to analog hardware noise, and its superior accuracy compared to recurrent architectures with an equivalent number of parameters. DenRAM not only brings rich temporal processing capabilities to neuromorphic architectures, but also reduces the memory footprint of edge devices, provides high accuracy on temporal benchmarks, and represents a significant step-forward in low-power real-time signal processing technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

The emergence of the 3rd wave information has made a proportion of maps are available to be generated ubiquitously, which would significantly enrich the dimensions and perspectives to understand the characteristics of the real world. However, a majority of map dataset have never been discovered, acquired and effectively used, and the map data used in many applications might not be completely fitted for the authentic demands of these applications. This challenge is emerged due to the lack of numerous well-labelled benchmark datasets for implementing the deep learning approaches into identifying complicated map content. Thus, we develop a large-scale benchmark dataset that includes well-labelled dataset for map text annotation recognition, map scene classification, map super-resolution reconstruction, and map style transferring. Furthermore, these well-labelled datasets would facilitate the state-of-the-art machine intelligence technologies to conduct map feature detection, map pattern recognition and map content retrieval. We hope our efforts would be useful for AI-enhanced cartographical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This is because one should (i) infer the 3D shape from a 2D image, which is a severely underconstrained problem, and (ii) implement the whole solution pipeline in real-time. The pipeline typically requires feature detection and matching, mismatch filtering, 3D shape inference and feature tracking algorithms. We propose ROBUSfT, a conventional pipeline based on a template containing the object's rest shape, texturemap and deformation law. ROBUSfT is ready-to-use, wide-baseline, capable of handling large deformations, fast up to 30 fps, free of training, and robust against partial occlusions and discontinuity in video frames.

Despite significant progress in implicit shape reconstruction, state-of-the-art mesh extraction methods often produce aliased, perceptually distorted surfaces and lack scalability to high-resolution 3D shapes. We present a data-driven approach for automatic feature detection and remeshing that requires only a coarse, aliased mesh as input and scales to arbitrary resolution reconstructions. We define and learn a collection of surface-based fields to (1) capture sharp geometric features in the shape with an implicit vertexwise model and (2) approximate improvements in normals alignment obtained by applying edge-flips with an edgewise model. To support scaling to arbitrary complexity shapes, we learn our fields using local triangulated patches, fusing estimates on complete surface meshes. Our feature remeshing algorithm integrates the learned fields as sharp feature priors and optimizes vertex placement and mesh connectivity for maximum expected surface improvement. On a challenging collection of high-resolution shape reconstructions in the ABC dataset, our algorithm improves over state-of-the-art by 26% normals F-score and 42% perceptual $\text{RMSE}_{\text{v}}$.</p></details> |  | None |

This work discusses methods and challenges in data-driven modeling of automated damage and defect detectors using X-ray single- and multi-projection (CT) images. Three main issues are identified: Data and feature variance, data feature labeling (for supervised machine learning), and the missing ground truth. It will be shown that only simulation of data can deliver a ground truth data set and accurate labeling. Noise has significant impact on the feature detection and will be discussed. Data-driven feature detectors are implemented with semantic pixel- or z-profile Convolutional Neural Networks and LSTM Auto-encoders. Data is measured with three different devices: A low-quality and low-cost (Low-Q), a mid- and a high-quality (micro-CT, Mid-/High-Q) device.

However, we still encounter challenges when applying VIO to a micro air vehicle (MAV) equipped with a downward-looking camera. Specifically, VIO cannot compute the correct initialization results during take-off and the cumulative drift is large when the MAV is flying in the air. To overcome these problems, we propose a homographybased initialization method, which utilizes the fact that the features detected by the downward-looking camera during take-off are approximately on the same plane. Then we introduce the prior normal vector and motion field to make states more accurate. In addition, to deal with the cumulative drift, a strategy for dynamically weighting visual residuals is proposed. Finally, we evaluate our method on the collected real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can be successfully initialized no matter how the MAV takes off and the positioning errors are also greatly improved.</p></details> |  | None |

A novel self-supervised approach is proposed to stratify landscape based on mobility activity time series. First, the time series signal is transformed to the frequency domain and then compressed into task-agnostic temporal embeddings by a contractive autoencoder, which preserves cyclic temporal patterns observed in time series. The pixel-wise embeddings are converted to image-like channels that can be used for task-based, multimodal modeling of downstream geospatial tasks using deep semantic segmentation. Experiments show that temporal embeddings are semantically meaningful representations of time series data and are effective across different tasks such as classifying residential area and commercial areas. Temporal embeddings transform sequential, spatiotemporal motion trajectory data into semantically meaningful image-like tensor representations that can be combined (multimodal fusion) with other data modalities that are or can be transformed into image-like tensor representations (for e.g., RBG imagery, graph embeddings of road networks, passively collected imagery like SAR, etc.) to facilitate multimodal learning in geospatial computer vision. Multimodal computer vision is critical for training machine learning models for geospatial feature detection to keep a geospatial mapping service up-to-date in real-time and can significantly improve user experience and above all, user safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract accepted for presentation at BayLearn 2023. 3 pages, 7 figures.

Classification methods have been developed in previous studies. Among these, Byers and Raftery (1998) models the observed Kth nearest neighbour distances as a mixture distribution and classifies the clutter and feature points consequently. In this paper, we enhance such approach in two manners. First, we propose an automatic procedure for selecting the number of nearest neighbours to consider in the classification method by means of segmented regression models. Secondly, with the aim of applying the procedure multiple times to get a ``better" end result, we propose a stopping criterion that minimizes the overall entropy measure of cluster separation between clutter and feature points. The proposed procedures are suitable for a feature with clutter as two superimposed Poisson processes on any space, including linear networks. We present simulations and two case studies of environmental data to illustrate the method.</p></details> |  | None |

Several of these approaches also combine other sensors (inertial sensing, for example) to perform combined state estimation. Our work rethinks this approach; we present a representation learning mechanism that identifies visual features that best correspond to robot motion as estimated by an external signal. Specifically, we utilize the robot's transformations through an external signal (inertial sensing, for example) and give attention to image space that is most consistent with the external signal. We use a pairwise consistency metric as a representation to keep the visual features consistent through a sequence with the robot's relative pose transformations. This approach enables us to incorporate information from the robot's perspective instead of solely relying on the image attributes. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets such as KITTI & EuRoC and compare the refined features with existing feature descriptors. We also evaluate our method using our real robot experiment. We notice an average of 49% reduction in the image search space without compromising the trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method reduces the execution time of visual odometry by 4.3% and also reduces reprojection errors. We demonstrate the need to select only the most important features and show the competitiveness using various feature detection baselines.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Generalized Differentiable RANSAC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13185v3)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose $\nabla$-RANSAC, a generalized differentiable RANSAC that allows learning the entire randomized robust estimation pipeline. The proposed approach enables the use of relaxation techniques for estimating the gradients in the sampling distribution, which are then propagated through a differentiable solver. The trainable quality function marginalizes over the scores from all the models estimated within $\nabla$-RANSAC to guide the network learning accurate and useful inlier probabilities or to train feature detection and matching networks. Our method directly maximizes the probability of drawing a good hypothesis, allowing us to learn better sampling distributions. We test $\nabla$-RANSAC on various real-world scenarios on fundamental and essential matrix estimation, and 3D point cloud registration, outdoors and indoors, with handcrafted and learning-based features. It is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy while running at a similar speed to its less accurate alternatives.

Not only there is a large choice for different sensors, but also these can be transported by different platforms, which can provide different scan geometries. In this work we test the extraction of four different keypoint detectors and three feature descriptors. We benchmark performance in terms of calculation time and we assess their performance in terms of accuracy in their ability in coarse automatic co-registration of two clouds that are collected with different sensors, platforms and scan geometries. One, which we define as having the higher accuracy, and thus will be used as reference, was surveyed via a UAV flight with a Riegl MiniVUX-3, the other on a bicycle with a Livox Horizon over a walking path with un-even ground.The novelty in this work consists in comparing several strategies for fast alignment of point clouds from very different surveying geometries, as the drone has a bird's eye view and the bicycle a ground-based view. An added challenge is related to the lower cost of the bicycle sensor ensemble that, together with the rough terrain, reasonably results in lower accuracy of the survey. The main idea is to use range images to capture a simplified version of the geometry of the surveyed area and then find the best features to match keypoints. Results show that NARF features detected more keypoints and resulted in a faster co-registration procedure in this scenariowhereas the accuracy of the co-registration is similar to all the combinations of keypoint detectors and features.</p></details> |  | None |

In Poisson surface reconstruction, the implicit function is generated by a set of smooth basis functions centered at the octnodes. When the octree depth is properly selected, the reconstructed surface is a good smooth approximation of the noisy point set. Our method projects the noisy points onto the surface and alternately reconstructs and projects the point set. We use the iterative Poisson surface reconstruction (iPSR) to support unoriented surface reconstruction. Our method iteratively performs iPSR and acts as an outer loop of iPSR. Considering that the octree depth significantly affects the reconstruction results, we propose an adaptive depth selection strategy to ensure an appropriate depth choice. To manage the oversmoothing phenomenon near the sharp features, we propose a $\lambda$-projection method, which means to project the noisy points onto the surface with an individual control coefficient $\lambda_{i}$ for each point. The coefficients are determined through a Voronoi-based feature detection method. Experimental results show that our method achieves high performance in point cloud denoising and unoriented surface reconstruction within different noise scales, and exhibits well-rounded performance in various types of inputs.

| **[MAP: A Model-agnostic Pretraining Framework for Click-through Rate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01737v1)** | 2023-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of personalized online services, click-through rate (CTR) prediction has received more and more attention and research. The most prominent features of CTR prediction are its multi-field categorical data format, and vast and daily-growing data volume. The large capacity of neural models helps digest such massive amounts of data under the supervised learning paradigm, yet they fail to utilize the substantial data to its full potential, since the 1-bit click signal is not sufficient to guide the model to learn capable representations of features and instances. The self-supervised learning paradigm provides a more promising pretrain-finetune solution to better exploit the large amount of user click logs, and learn more generalized and effective representations. However, self-supervised learning for CTR prediction is still an open question, since current works on this line are only preliminary and rudimentary. To this end, we propose a Model-agnostic pretraining (MAP) framework that applies feature corruption and recovery on multi-field categorical data, and more specifically, we derive two practical algorithms: masked feature prediction (MFP) and replaced feature detection (RFD). MFP digs into feature interactions within each instance through masking and predicting a small portion of input features, and introduces noise contrastive estimation (NCE) to handle large feature spaces. RFD further turns MFP into a binary classification mode through replacing and detecting changes in input features, making it even simpler and more effective for CTR pretraining. Our extensive experiments on two real-world large-scale datasets (i.e., Avazu, Criteo) demonstrate the advantages of these two methods on several strong backbones (e.g., DCNv2, DeepFM), and achieve new state-of-the-art performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency for CTR prediction.</p></details> | KDD 2023 | None |

We extend the classification method developed in previous studies to this more complex geometric context, where the classical properties of a point process change and data visualization are not intuitive. We use the K-th nearest neighbour volumes distribution in linear networks for this approach. As a result, our method is suitable for analysing point patterns consisting of features and clutter as two superimposed Poisson processes on the same linear network. To illustrate the method, we present simulations and examples of road traffic accidents that resulted in injuries or deaths in two cities in Colombia.</p></details> |  | None |

The integration of machine learning with quantum computing has the potential to yield tools offering not only better accuracy and computational efficiency, but also superior robustness against adversarial attacks. Indeed, recent work has employed quantum mechanical phenomena to defend against adversarial attacks, spurring the rapid development of the field of quantum adversarial machine learning (QAML) and potentially yielding a new source of quantum advantage. Despite promising early results, there remain challenges towards building robust real-world QAML tools. In this review we discuss recent progress in QAML and identify key challenges. We also suggest future research directions which could determine the route to practicality for QAML approaches as quantum computing hardware scales up and noise levels are reduced.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 4 Figures | None |

Prior methods focus on extracting large amounts of often redundant locally reliable features, resulting in limited efficiency and accuracy, especially in large-scale environments under challenging conditions. Instead, we propose to extract globally reliable features by implicitly embedding high-level semantics into both the detection and description processes. Specifically, our semantic-aware detector is able to detect keypoints from reliable regions (e.g. building, traffic lane) and suppress unreliable areas (e.g. sky, car) implicitly instead of relying on explicit semantic labels. This boosts the accuracy of keypoint matching by reducing the number of features sensitive to appearance changes and avoiding the need of additional segmentation networks at test time. Moreover, our descriptors are augmented with semantics and have stronger discriminative ability, providing more inliers at test time. Particularly, experiments on long-term large-scale visual localization Aachen Day-Night and RobotCar-Seasons datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms previous local features and gives competitive accuracy to advanced matchers but is about 2 and 3 times faster when using 2k and 4k keypoints, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023. code is available at https://github.com/feixue94/sfd2</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/feixue94/sfd2) |

The proposed feature detection algorithm fully considers the boundary characteristics retained by the corners with geometric distortion, thus enabling reliable detection at a low calculation cost. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significant advantages in terms of real-time and robustness. Finally, we have achieved the high-density 3-d contact deformation visualization based on this detection method.

Conventional satellite or aerial-based remote sensing (RS) platforms can provide the necessary data sources for the 3D reconstruction of large-scale landforms and cities. Even with low-altitude UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), 3D reconstruction in complicated situations, such as urban canyons and indoor scenes, is challenging due to frequent tracking failures between camera frames and high data collection costs. Recently, spherical images have been extensively used due to the capability of recording surrounding environments from one camera exposure. In contrast to perspective images with limited FOV (Field of View), spherical images can cover the whole scene with full horizontal and vertical FOV and facilitate camera tracking and data acquisition in these complex scenes. With the rapid evolution and extensive use of professional and consumer-grade spherical cameras, spherical images show great potential for the 3D modeling of urban and indoor scenes. Classical 3D reconstruction pipelines, however, cannot be directly used for spherical images. Besides, there exist few software packages that are designed for the 3D reconstruction of spherical images. As a result, this research provides a thorough survey of the state-of-the-art for 3D reconstruction of spherical images in terms of data acquisition, feature detection and matching, image orientation, and dense matching as well as presenting promising applications and discussing potential prospects. We anticipate that this study offers insightful clues to direct future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Without enough good-quality emotion-tagged datasets, researchers cannot conduct repeatable affective computing research in EARS that generates personalized recommendations based on users' emotional preferences. Similarly, if we fail to fully protect users' emotional data privacy, users could resist engaging with EARS services. This paper introduced a method that detects affective features in subjective passages using the Generative Pre-trained Transformer Technology, forming the basis of the Affective Index and Affective Index Indicator (AII). Eliminate the need for users to build an affective feature detection mechanism. The paper advocates for a separation of responsibility approach where users protect their emotional profile data while EARS service providers refrain from retaining or storing it. Service providers can update users' Affective Indices in memory without saving their privacy data, providing Affective Aware recommendations without compromising user privacy. This paper offers a solution to the subjectivity and variability of emotions, data privacy concerns, and evaluation metrics and benchmarks, paving the way for future EARS research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning-Based Framework for Camera Calibration with Distortion Correction and High Precision Feature Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00158v3)** | 2023-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera calibration is a crucial technique which significantly influences the performance of many robotic systems. Robustness and high precision have always been the pursuit of diverse calibration methods. State-of-the-art calibration techniques based on classical Zhang's method, however, still suffer from environmental noise, radial lens distortion and sub-optimal parameter estimation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid camera calibration framework which combines learning-based approaches with traditional methods to handle these bottlenecks. In particular, this framework leverages learning-based approaches to perform efficient distortion correction and robust chessboard corner coordinate encoding. For sub-pixel accuracy of corner detection, a specially-designed coordinate decoding algorithm with embed outlier rejection mechanism is proposed. To avoid sub-optimal estimation results, we improve the traditional parameter estimation by RANSAC algorithm and achieve stable results. Compared with two widely-used camera calibration toolboxes, experiment results on both real and synthetic datasets manifest the better robustness and higher precision of the proposed framework. The massive synthetic dataset is the basis of our framework's decent performance and will be publicly available along with the code at https://github.com/Easonyesheng/CCS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Easonyesheng/CCS) |

Existing feature tracking methods for event cameras are either handcrafted or derived from first principles but require extensive parameter tuning, are sensitive to noise, and do not generalize to different scenarios due to unmodeled effects. To tackle these deficiencies, we introduce the first data-driven feature tracker for event cameras, which leverages low-latency events to track features detected in a grayscale frame. We achieve robust performance via a novel frame attention module, which shares information across feature tracks. By directly transferring zero-shot from synthetic to real data, our data-driven tracker outperforms existing approaches in relative feature age by up to 120% while also achieving the lowest latency. This performance gap is further increased to 130% by adapting our tracker to real data with a novel self-supervision strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works introduce deep learning-based semantic information to SLAM systems to reduce the influence of dynamic objects. However, it is still challenging to apply a robust localization in dynamic environments for resource-restricted robots. This paper proposes a real-time RGB-D inertial odometry system for resource-restricted robots in dynamic environments named Dynamic-VINS. Three main threads run in parallel: object detection, feature tracking, and state optimization. The proposed Dynamic-VINS combines object detection and depth information for dynamic feature recognition and achieves performance comparable to semantic segmentation. Dynamic-VINS adopts grid-based feature detection and proposes a fast and efficient method to extract high-quality FAST feature points. IMU is applied to predict motion for feature tracking and moving consistency check. The proposed method is evaluated on both public datasets and real-world applications and shows competitive localization accuracy and robustness in dynamic environments. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, it is the best-performance real-time RGB-D inertial odometry for resource-restricted platforms in dynamic environments for now.

Current marker-based VSLAM approaches mainly utilize markers for improving feature detections in low-feature environments and/or for incorporating loop closure constraints, generating only low-level geometric maps of the environment prone to inaccuracies in complex environments. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a VSLAM approach utilizing a monocular camera along with fiducial markers to generate hierarchical representations of the environment while improving the camera pose estimate. The proposed approach detects semantic entities from the surroundings, including walls, corridors, and rooms encoded within markers, and appropriately adds topological constraints among them. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected with a robot demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a traditional marker-based VSLAM baseline in terms of accuracy, given the addition of new constraints while creating enhanced map representations.

SfM consists of three main steps; feature detection and matching, camera motion estimation, and recovery of 3D structure from estimated intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and features. A problem encountered in SfM is that scenes lacking texture or with repetitive features can cause erroneous feature matching between frames. Semantic segmentation offers a route to validate and correct SfM models by labelling pixels in the input images with the use of a deep convolutional neural network. The semantic and geometric properties associated with classes in the scene can be taken advantage of to apply prior constraints to each class of object. The SfM pipeline COLMAP and semantic segmentation pipeline DeepLab were used. This, along with planar reconstruction of the dense model, were used to determine erroneous points that may be occluded from the calculated camera position, given the semantic label, and thus prior constraint of the reconstructed plane. Herein, semantic segmentation is integrated into SfM to apply priors on the 3D point cloud, given the object detection in the 2D input images. Additionally, the semantic labels of matched keypoints are compared and inconsistent semantically labelled points discarded. Furthermore, semantic labels on input images are used for the removal of objects associated with motion in the output SfM models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a data-set of 1102 images of a repetitive architecture scene. This project offers a novel method for improved validation of 3D SfM models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it is challenging to learn the features in the underwater scenario due to the absence of annotated underwater datasets. This paper proposes a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework for training an underwater feature detection and matching network (UFEN). In particular, we use in-air RGBD data to generate synthetic underwater images based on a physical underwater imaging formation model and employ these as the medium to distil knowledge from a teacher model SuperPoint pretrained on in-air images. We embed UFEN into the ORB-SLAM3 framework to replace the ORB feature by introducing an additional binarization layer. To test the effectiveness of our method, we built a new underwater dataset with groundtruth measurements named EASI (https://github.com/Jinghe-mel/UFEN-SLAM), recorded in an indoor water tank for different turbidity levels. The experimental results on the existing dataset and our new dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2023),6 pages</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Jinghe-mel/UFEN-SLAM) |

An empirical study on natural feature detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09660v1)** | 2023-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the interpretability of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) models has become critically important to open the "black box" of complex AI models, such as deep learning. This paper compares popular saliency map generation techniques and their strengths and weaknesses in interpreting GeoAI and deep learning models' reasoning behaviors, particularly when applied to geospatial analysis and image processing tasks. We surveyed two broad classes of model explanation methods: perturbation-based and gradient-based methods. The former identifies important image areas, which help machines make predictions by modifying a localized area of the input image. The latter evaluates the contribution of every single pixel of the input image to the model's prediction results through gradient backpropagation. In this study, three algorithms-the occlusion method, the integrated gradients method, and the class activation map method-are examined for a natural feature detection task using deep learning. The algorithms' strengths and weaknesses are discussed, and the consistency between model-learned and human-understandable concepts for object recognition is also compared. The experiments used two GeoAI-ready datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of the research findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 7 Figures, Accepted to International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Automated Vulnerability Detection in Source Code Using Quantum Natural Language Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07525v1)** | 2023-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most important challenges in the field of software code audit is the presence of vulnerabilities in software source code. These flaws are highly likely ex-ploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of ser-vice. C and C++ open source code are now available in order to create a large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a siz-able dataset of millions of open-source functions that point to poten-tial exploits. We created an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural network model Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model Long Short Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the de-pendency. Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state of the art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance, we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, re-call, accuracy, and total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as semantic and syntactic represen-tation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs faster than its classical counterpart.</p></details> |  | None |

Extended to metrology, goals include estimating SE yield at each pixel and detecting differences in SE yield across pixels; obstacles include shot noise in the particle source as well as lack of knowledge of and variability in the instrument response to single SEs. A recently introduced time-resolved measurement paradigm promises mitigation of source shot noise, but its analysis and development have been largely limited to estimation problems under an idealization in which SE bursts are directly and perfectly counted. Here, analyses are extended to error exponents in feature detection problems and to degraded measurements that are representative of actual instrument behavior for estimation problems. For estimation from idealized SE counts, insights on existing estimators and a superior estimator are also provided. For estimation in a realistic PBM imaging scenario, extensions to the idealized model are introduced, methods for model parameter extraction are discussed, and large improvements from time-resolved data are presented.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[RipViz: Finding Rip Currents by Learning Pathline Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12983v1)** | 2023-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hybrid machine learning and flow analysis feature detection method, RipViz, to extract rip currents from stationary videos. Rip currents are dangerous strong currents that can drag beachgoers out to sea. Most people are either unaware of them or do not know what they look like. In some instances, even trained personnel such as lifeguards have difficulty identifying them. RipViz produces a simple, easy to understand visualization of rip location overlaid on the source video. With RipViz, we first obtain an unsteady 2D vector field from the stationary video using optical flow. Movement at each pixel is analyzed over time. At each seed point, sequences of short pathlines, rather a single long pathline, are traced across the frames of the video to better capture the quasi-periodic flow behavior of wave activity. Because of the motion on the beach, the surf zone, and the surrounding areas, these pathlines may still appear very cluttered and incomprehensible. Furthermore, lay audiences are not familiar with pathlines and may not know how to interpret them. To address this, we treat rip currents as a flow anomaly in an otherwise normal flow. To learn about the normal flow behavior, we train an LSTM autoencoder with pathline sequences from normal ocean, foreground, and background movements. During test time, we use the trained LSTM autoencoder to detect anomalous pathlines (i.e., those in the rip zone). The origination points of such anomalous pathlines, over the course of the video, are then presented as points within the rip zone. RipViz is fully automated and does not require user input. Feedback from domain expert suggests that RipViz has the potential for wider use.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the article published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2023</p></details> | None |

The ability to match MRI images would also enable such applications as indexing and searching MRI images among multiple patients or selecting images from the region of interest. In this work, we have introduced robustness, accuracy and cumulative distance metrics and methodology that allows us to compare different techniques and approaches in matching brain MRI of different patients or matching MRI brain slice to a position in the brain atlas. To that end, we have used feature detection methods AGAST, AKAZE, BRISK, GFTT, HardNet, and ORB, which are established methods in image processing, and compared them on their resistance to image degradation and their ability to match the same brain MRI slice of different patients. We have demonstrated that some of these techniques can correctly match most of the brain MRI slices of different patients. When matching is performed with the atlas of the human brain, their performance is significantly lower. The best performing feature detection method was a combination of SIFT detector and HardNet descriptor that achieved 93% accuracy in matching images with other patients and only 52% accurately matched images when compared to atlas.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[R2FD2: Fast and Robust Matching of Multimodal Remote Sensing Image via Repeatable Feature Detector and Rotation-invariant Feature Descriptor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02277v4)** | 2023-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically identifying feature correspondences between multimodal images is facing enormous challenges because of the significant differences both in radiation and geometry. To address these problems, we propose a novel feature matching method (named R2FD2) that is robust to radiation and rotation differences. Our R2FD2 is conducted in two critical contributions, consisting of a repeatable feature detector and a rotation-invariant feature descriptor. In the first stage, a repeatable feature detector called the Multi-channel Auto-correlation of the Log-Gabor (MALG) is presented for feature detection, which combines the multi-channel auto-correlation strategy with the Log-Gabor wavelets to detect interest points (IPs) with high repeatability and uniform distribution. In the second stage, a rotation-invariant feature descriptor is constructed, named the Rotation-invariant Maximum index map of the Log-Gabor (RMLG), which consists of two components: fast assignment of dominant orientation and construction of feature representation. In the process of fast assignment of dominant orientation, a Rotation-invariant Maximum Index Map (RMIM) is built to address rotation deformations. Then, the proposed RMLG incorporates the rotation-invariant RMIM with the spatial configuration of DAISY to depict a more discriminative feature representation, which improves RMLG's resistance to radiation and rotation variances.Experimental results show that the proposed R2FD2 outperforms five state-of-the-art feature matching methods, and has superior advantages in adaptability and universality. Moreover, our R2FD2 achieves the accuracy of matching within two pixels and has a great advantage in matching efficiency over other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 33 pages, 15 figures | None |

This requires algorithms for real-time, automated spacecraft feature recognition to pinpoint the locations of collision hazards (e.g. solar panels or antennas) and safe docking features (e.g. satellite bodies or thrusters) so safe, effective flightpaths can be planned. Prior work in this area reveals the performance of computer vision models are highly dependent on the training dataset and its coverage of scenarios visually similar to the real scenarios that occur in deployment. Hence, the algorithm may have degraded performance under certain lighting conditions even when the rendezvous maneuver conditions of the chaser to the target spacecraft are the same. This work delves into how humans perform these tasks through a survey of how aerospace engineering students experienced with spacecraft shapes and components recognize features of the three spacecraft: Landsat, Envisat, Anik, and the orbiter Mir. The survey reveals that the most common patterns in the human detection process were to consider the shape and texture of the features: antennas, solar panels, thrusters, and satellite bodies. This work introduces a novel algorithm SpaceYOLO, which fuses a state-of-the-art object detector YOLOv5 with a separate neural network based on these human-inspired decision processes exploiting shape and texture. Performance in autonomous spacecraft detection of SpaceYOLO is compared to ordinary YOLOv5 in hardware-in-the-loop experiments under different lighting and chaser maneuver conditions at the ORION Laboratory at Florida Tech.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Aerospace Conference 2023, 11 pages, 21 figures</p></details> | None |

Prior art has tackled each of these components individually, purportedly aiming to alleviate difficulties in effectively train a holistic network. We design a self-supervised image warping correspondence loss for both feature detection and matching, a weakly-supervised epipolar constraints loss on relative camera pose learning, and a directional matching scheme that detects key-point features in a source image and performs coarse-to-fine correspondence search on the target image. We leverage this framework to enforce cycle consistency in our matching module. In addition, we propose a new loss to robustly handle both definite inlier/outlier matches and less-certain matches. The integration of these learning mechanisms enables end-to-end training of a single network performing all three localization components. Bench-marking our approach on public data-sets, exemplifies how such an end-to-end framework is able to yield more accurate localization that out-performs both traditional methods as well as state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Our main application is in the identification of atomic columns and other features in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cubical persistent homology is used to identify local minima and their size in subregions in the frames of nanoparticle videos, which are hypothesized to correspond to relevant atomic features. We compare the performance of our algorithm to other employed methods for the detection of columns and their intensity. Additionally, Monte Carlo goodness-of-fit testing using real valued summaries of persistence diagrams derived from smoothed images (generated from pixels residing in the vacuum region of an image) is developed and employed to identify whether or not the proposed atomic features generated by our algorithm are due to noise. Using these summaries derived from the generated persistence diagrams, one can produce univariate time series for the nanoparticle videos, thus providing a means for assessing fluxional behavior. A guarantee on the false discovery rate for multiple Monte Carlo testing of identical hypotheses is also established.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 21 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Fixed and adaptive landmark sets for finite pseudometric spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09826v2)** | 2023-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological data analysis (TDA) is an expanding field that leverages principles and tools from algebraic topology to quantify structural features of data sets or transform them into more manageable forms. As its theoretical foundations have been developed, TDA has shown promise in extracting useful information from high-dimensional, noisy, and complex data such as those used in biomedicine. To improve efficiency, these techniques may employ landmark samplers. The heuristic maxmin procedure obtains a roughly even distribution of sample points by implicitly constructing a cover comprising sets of uniform radius. However, issues arise with data that vary in density or include points with multiplicities, as are common in biomedicine. We propose an analogous procedure, "lastfirst" based on ranked distances, which implies a cover comprising sets of uniform cardinality. We first rigorously define the procedure and prove that it obtains landmarks with desired properties. We then perform benchmark tests and compare its performance to that of maxmin, on feature detection and class prediction tasks involving simulated and real-world biomedical data. Lastfirst is more general than maxmin in that it can be applied to any data on which arbitrary (and not necessarily symmetric) pairwise distances can be computed. Lastfirst is more computationally costly, but our implementation scales at the same rate as maxmin. We find that lastfirst achieves comparable performance on prediction tasks and outperforms maxmin on homology detection tasks. Where the numerical values of similarity measures are not meaningful, as in many biomedical contexts, lastfirst sampling may also improve interpretability.</p></details> | 30 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[Large-scale Global Low-rank Optimization for Computational Compressed Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03047v1)** | 2023-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision and computational photography. Most of the conventional optimization and deep learning techniques explore local information for reconstruction. Recently, nonlocal low-rank (NLR) reconstruction has achieved remarkable success in improving accuracy and generalization. However, the computational cost has inhibited NLR from seeking global structural similarity, which consequentially keeps it trapped in the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency and prevents it from high-dimensional large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we report here the global low-rank (GLR) optimization technique, realizing highly-efficient large-scale reconstruction with global self-similarity. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism in deep learning, GLR extracts exemplar image patches by feature detection instead of conventional uniform selection. This directly produces key patches using structural features to avoid burdensome computational redundancy. Further, it performs patch matching across the entire image via neural-based convolution, which produces the global similarity heat map in parallel, rather than conventional sequential block-wise matching. As such, GLR improves patch grouping efficiency by more than one order of magnitude. We experimentally demonstrate GLR's effectiveness on temporal, frequency, and spectral dimensions, including different computational imaging modalities of compressive temporal imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and multispectral filter array demosaicing. This work presents the superiority of inherent fusion of deep learning strategies and iterative optimization, and breaks the persistent dilemma of the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency for various large-scale reconstruction tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Joint Embedding of 2D and 3D Networks for Medical Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10939v2)** | 2022-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining ground truth data in medical imaging has difficulties due to the fact that it requires a lot of annotating time from the experts in the field. Also, when trained with supervised learning, it detects only the cases included in the labels. In real practice, we want to also open to other possibilities than the named cases while examining the medical images. As a solution, the need for anomaly detection that can detect and localize abnormalities by learning the normal characteristics using only normal images is emerging. With medical image data, we can design either 2D or 3D networks of self-supervised learning for anomaly detection task. Although 3D networks, which learns 3D structures of the human body, show good performance in 3D medical image anomaly detection, they cannot be stacked in deeper layers due to memory problems. While 2D networks have advantage in feature detection, they lack 3D context information. In this paper, we develop a method for combining the strength of the 3D network and the strength of the 2D network through joint embedding. We also propose the pretask of self-supervised learning to make it possible for the networks to learn efficiently. Through the experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance in both classification and segmentation tasks compared to the SoTA method.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures | None |

At present, it still has some deficiencies needing further improvement, mainly including the discrimination power of extracted local descriptors, the localization accuracy of detected keypoints, and the efficiency of local feature learning. This paper focuses on promoting the currently popular sparse local feature learning with camera pose supervision. Therefore, it pertinently proposes a Shared Coupling-bridge scheme with four light-weight yet effective improvements for weakly-supervised local feature (SCFeat) learning. It mainly contains: i) the \emph{Feature-Fusion-ResUNet Backbone} (F2R-Backbone) for local descriptors learning, ii) a shared coupling-bridge normalization to improve the decoupling training of description network and detection network, iii) an improved detection network with peakiness measurement to detect keypoints and iv) the fundamental matrix error as a reward factor to further optimize feature detection training. Extensive experiments prove that our SCFeat improvement is effective. It could often obtain a state-of-the-art performance on classic image matching and visual localization. In terms of 3D reconstruction, it could still achieve competitive results.

This paper focuses on the grid model analysis, where voltage deviations between the grid model (digital twin) and real-world measurements at a low-voltage pilot site have been evaluated. Energy measurements from smart meters represent hourly mean power, while voltage measurements are instantaneous with uneven time intervals. Thus, measurements are not synchronous, which poses a major challenge for grid analysis. The proposed method focuses on daily mean, minimum, and maximum voltage and results show that deviations in daily minimum voltage are the most useful ones.

Most existing algorithms focus on feature detection from a sharp image. They would thus have degraded performance once the image is blurred, which could happen easily under low-lighting conditions. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet both efficient and effective keypoint detection method that is able to accurately localize the salient keypoints in a blurred image. Our method takes advantages of a novel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based architecture that significantly improve the detection repeatability for a blurred image. The network is also light-weight and able to run in real-time, which enables its deployment for time-constrained applications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our detector is able to improve the detection repeatability with blurred images, while keeping comparable performance as existing state-of-the-art detectors for sharp images.</p></details> |  | None |

An accurate calibration of the intrinsics and extrinsics is a critical pre-requisite for using the edge of a wide-angle lens for depth perception and odometry. Calibrating wide-angle lenses with current state-of-the-art techniques yields poor results due to extreme distortion at the edge, as most algorithms assume a lens with low to medium distortion closer to a pinhole projection. In this work we present our methodology for accurate wide-angle calibration. Our pipeline generates an intermediate model, and leverages it to iteratively improve feature detection and eventually the camera parameters. We test three key methods to utilize intermediate camera models: (1) undistorting the image into virtual pinhole cameras, (2) reprojecting the target into the image frame, and (3) adaptive subpixel refinement. Combining adaptive subpixel refinement and feature reprojection significantly improves reprojection errors by up to 26.59 %, helps us detect up to 42.01 % more features, and improves performance in the downstream task of dense depth mapping. Finally, TartanCalib is open-source and implemented into an easy-to-use calibration toolbox. We also provide a translation layer with other state-of-the-art works, which allows for regressing generic models with thousands of parameters or using a more robust solver. To this end, TartanCalib is the tool of choice for wide-angle calibration. Project website and code: http://tartancalib.com.</p></details> |  | None |

Consequently, many point cloud feature detection methods have been proposed in the literature to automate some workflows, such as their classification or part segmentation. Nevertheless, the performance of point cloud automated systems significantly lags behind their image counterparts. While part of this failure stems from the irregularity, unstructuredness, and disorder of point clouds, which makes the task of point cloud feature detection significantly more challenging than the image one, we argue that a lack of inspiration from the image domain might be the primary cause of such a gap. Indeed, given the overwhelming success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image feature detection, it seems reasonable to design their point cloud counterparts, but none of the proposed approaches closely resembles them. Specifically, even though many approaches generalise the convolution operation in point clouds, they fail to emulate the CNNs multiple-feature detection and pooling operations. For this reason, we propose a graph convolution-based unit, dubbed Shrinking unit, that can be stacked vertically and horizontally for the design of CNN-like 3D point cloud feature extractors. Given that self, local and global correlations between points in a point cloud convey crucial spatial geometric information, we also leverage them during the feature extraction process. We evaluate our proposal by designing a feature extractor model for the ModelNet-10 benchmark dataset and achieve 90.64% classification accuracy, demonstrating that our innovative idea is effective.

A common method is to identify instances of a certain linguistic feature - say, the zero copula construction - in a corpus, and analyze the feature's distribution across speakers, topics, and other variables, to either gain a qualitative understanding of the feature's function or systematically measure variation. In this paper, we explore the challenging task of automatic morphosyntactic feature detection in low-resource English varieties. We present a human-in-the-loop approach to generate and filter effective contrast sets via corpus-guided edits. We show that our approach improves feature detection for both Indian English and African American English, demonstrate how it can assist linguistic research, and release our fine-tuned models for use by other researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Field...</summary><p>Field Matters Workshop at COLING 2022</p></details> | None |

Recent deep learning models intend to address the homography estimation problem using a single convolutional network. While these models are trained in an end-to-end fashion to simplify the homography estimation problem, they lack the feature matching step and/or the outlier removal step, which are important steps in the traditional homography estimation pipeline. In this paper, we attempt to build a deep learning model that mimics all four steps in the traditional homography estimation pipeline. In particular, the feature matching step is implemented using the cost volume technique. To remove outliers in the cost volume, we treat this outlier removal problem as a denoising problem and propose a novel self-supervised loss to solve the problem.

While deep learning has led to great advancements in feature detection and description, training and validating data-driven models for space applications is challenging due to the limited availability of large-scale, annotated datasets. This paper introduces AstroVision, a large-scale dataset comprised of 115,970 densely annotated, real images of 16 different small bodies captured during past and ongoing missions. We leverage AstroVision to develop a set of standardized benchmarks and conduct an exhaustive evaluation of both handcrafted and data-driven feature detection and description methods. Next, we employ AstroVision for end-to-end training of a state-of-the-art, deep feature detection and description network and demonstrate improved performance on multiple benchmarks. The full benchmarking pipeline and the dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate the advancement of computer vision algorithms for space applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite event camera's unique data output, many event feature detection and tracking algorithms have shown significant progress by making detours to frame-based data representations. This paper questions the need to do so and proposes a novel event data-friendly method that achieve simultaneous feature detection and tracking, called event Clustering-based Detection and Tracking (eCDT). Our method employs a novel clustering method, named as k-NN Classifier-based Spatial Clustering and Applications with Noise (KCSCAN), to cluster adjacent polarity events to retrieve event trajectories.With the aid of a Head and Tail Descriptor Matching process, event clusters that reappear in a different polarity are continually tracked, elongating the feature tracks. Thanks to our clustering approach in spatio-temporal space, our method automatically solves feature detection and feature tracking simultaneously. Also, eCDT can extract feature tracks at any frequency with an adjustable time window, which does not corrupt the high temporal resolution of the original event data. Our method achieves 30% better feature tracking ages compared with the state-of-the-art approach while also having a low error approximately equal to it.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS2...</summary><p>IROS2022 accepted paper</p></details> | None |

Recent studies on self-supervised learning of visual representations have driven the increasing performance of learnable models based on deep networks. By leveraging traditional data augmentations and homography transformations, these networks learn to detect corners under adverse conditions such as extreme illumination changes. However, their generalization capabilities are limited to corner-like features detected a priori by classical methods or synthetically generated data. In this paper, we propose the Correspondence Network (CorrNet) that learns to detect repeatable keypoints and to extract discriminative descriptions via unsupervised contrastive learning under spatial constraints. Our experiments show that CorrNet is not only able to detect low-level features such as corners, but also high-level features that represent similar objects present in a pair of input images through our proposed joint guided backpropagation of their latent space. Our approach obtains competitive results under viewpoint changes and achieves state-of-the-art performance under illumination changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE WCCI 2022</p></details> | None |

In this letter, we explore a data-driven approach to account for environmental lighting changes, improving the quality of images for use in visual odometry (VO) or visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We train a deep convolutional neural network model to predictively adjust camera gain and exposure time parameters such that consecutive images contain a maximal number of matchable features. The training process is fully self-supervised: our training signal is derived from an underlying VO or SLAM pipeline and, as a result, the model is optimized to perform well with that specific pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive real-world experiments that our network can anticipate and compensate for dramatic lighting changes (e.g., transitions into and out of road tunnels), maintaining a substantially higher number of inlier feature matches than competing camera parameter control algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>In IE...</summary><p>In IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'21), Xi'an, China, May 30-Jun. 5, 2021</p></details> | None |

A visual odometry algorithm computes the incremental motion of the vehicle between the successive camera frames, then integrates these increments to determine the pose of the vehicle. The proposed neural network reduces the errors in the pose estimation of the vehicle which results from the inaccuracies in features detection and matching, camera intrinsic parameters, and so on. These inaccuracies are propagated to the motion estimation of the vehicle causing larger amounts of estimation errors. The drift reducing neural network identifies such errors based on the motion of features in the successive camera frames leading to more accurate incremental motion estimates. The proposed drift reducing neural network is trained and validated using the KITTI dataset and the results show the efficacy of the proposed approach in reducing the errors in the incremental orientation estimation, thus reducing the overall error in the pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper contains 6 pages and 10 figures.

Of particular interest is the ability of VCSELs to exhibit neural-like spiking responses, much like biological neurons, but at ultrafast sub-nanosecond rates; thus offering great prospects for high-speed light-enabled neuromorphic (spike-based) processors. Recent works have shown the use the spiking dynamics in VCSELs for pattern recognition and image processing problems such as image data encoding and edge-feature detection. Additionally, VCSELs have also been used recently as nonlinear elements in photonic reservoir computing (RC) implementations, yielding excellent state of the art operation. This work introduces and experimentally demonstrates for the first time the new concept of a Ghz-rate photonic spiking neural network (SNN) built with a single VCSEL neuron. The reported system effectively implements a photonic VCSEL-based spiking reservoir computer, and demonstrates its successful application to a complex nonlinear classification task. Importantly, the proposed system benefits from a highly hardware-friendly, inexpensive realization (built with a single VCSEL and off-the-shelf fibre-optic components), for high-speed (GHz-rate inputs) and low-power (sub-mW optical input power) photonic operation. These results open new pathways towards future neuromorphic photonic spike-based information processing systems based upon VCSELs (or other laser types) for novel ultrafast machine learning and AI hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures.

However, current deep learning faces major challenges for such applications because of the huge computational cost and the inefficient learning. Hence, we develop a novel brain-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based system titled Spiking Gating Flow (SGF) for online action learning. The developed system consists of multiple SGF units which assembled in a hierarchical manner. A single SGF unit involves three layers: a feature extraction layer, an event-driven layer and a histogram-based training layer. To demonstrate the developed system capabilities, we employ a standard Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) gesture classification as a benchmark. The results indicate that we can achieve 87.5% accuracy which is comparable with Deep Learning (DL), but at smaller training/inference data number ratio 1.5:1. And only a single training epoch is required during the learning process. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest accuracy among the non-backpropagation algorithm based SNNs. At last, we conclude the few-shot learning paradigm of the developed network: 1) a hierarchical structure-based network design involves human prior knowledge; 2) SNNs for content based global dynamic feature detection.</p></details> |  | None |

In comparison to convolutional neural networks, vision transformers have a weaker inductive bias and therefore allow a more flexible feature detection. Due to their promising feature detection, this work explores vision transformers for tumor detection in digital pathology whole slide images in four tissue types, and for tissue type identification. We compared the patch-wise classification performance of the vision transformer DeiT-Tiny to the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network ResNet18. Due to the sparse availability of annotated whole slide images, we further compared both models pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled whole-slide images using state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. The results show that the vision transformer performed slightly better than the ResNet18 for three of four tissue types for tumor detection while the ResNet18 performed slightly better for the remaining tasks. The aggregated predictions of both models on slide level were correlated, indicating that the models captured similar imaging features. All together, the vision transformer models performed on par with the ResNet18 while requiring more effort to train. In order to surpass the performance of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers might require more challenging tasks to benefit from their weak inductive bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, accepted for workshop T4Vision (CVPR 2022)</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-modal curb detection and filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07096v1)** | 2022-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable knowledge of road boundaries is critical for autonomous vehicle navigation. We propose a robust curb detection and filtering technique based on the fusion of camera semantics and dense lidar point clouds. The lidar point clouds are collected by fusing multiple lidars for robust feature detection. The camera semantics are based on a modified EfficientNet architecture which is trained with labeled data collected from onboard fisheye cameras. The point clouds are associated with the closest curb segment with $L_2$-norm analysis after projecting into the image space with the fisheye model projection. Next, the selected points are clustered using unsupervised density-based spatial clustering to detect different curb regions. As new curb points are detected in consecutive frames they are associated with the existing curb clusters using temporal reachability constraints. If no reachability constraints are found a new curb cluster is formed from these new points. This ensures we can detect multiple curbs present in road segments consisting of multiple lanes if they are in the sensors' field of view. Finally, Delaunay filtering is applied for outlier removal and its performance is compared to traditional RANSAC-based filtering. An objective evaluation of the proposed solution is done using a high-definition map containing ground truth curb points obtained from a commercial map supplier. The proposed system has proven capable of detecting curbs of any orientation in complex urban road scenarios comprising straight roads, curved roads, and intersections with traffic isles.</p></details> |  | None |

For the former type, mean square error (MSE) is usually used which cannot provide strong constraint for training and can make the model easy to be stuck into the collapsed solution. For the later one, due to the down sampling operation and the expansion of receptive fields, the details can be lost for local descriptors can be lost, making the constraint not fine enough. Considering the issues above, we propose to combine both ideas, which including three aspects. 1) We propose to achieve fine constraint based on the requirement of repeatability while coarse constraint with guidance of deep convolution features. 2) To address the issue that optimization with MSE is limited, entropy-based cost function is utilized, both soft cross-entropy and self-information. 3) With the guidance of convolution features, we define the cost function from both positive and negative sides. Finally, we study the effect of each modification proposed and experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Much effort has been devoted to demystify deep neural networks for better interpretability. Some feature attribution methods have shown promising results in computer vision, especially the gradient-based methods where effectively smoothing the gradients with reference data is key to a robust and faithful result. However, direct application of these gradient-based methods to NLP tasks is not trivial due to the fact that the input consists of discrete tokens and the "reference" tokens are not explicitly defined. In this work, we propose Locally Aggregated Feature Attribution (LAFA), a novel gradient-based feature attribution method for NLP models. Instead of relying on obscure reference tokens, it smooths gradients by aggregating similar reference texts derived from language model embeddings. For evaluation purpose, we also design experiments on different NLP tasks including Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis on public datasets as well as key feature detection on a constructed Amazon catalogue dataset. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments.</p></details> | NAACL 2022 | None |

In this work, we focus on making local descriptors "look wider to describe better" by learning local Descriptors with More Than just Local information (MTLDesc). Specifically, we resort to context augmentation and spatial attention mechanisms to make our MTLDesc obtain non-local awareness. First, Adaptive Global Context Augmented Module and Diverse Local Context Augmented Module are proposed to construct robust local descriptors with context information from global to local. Second, Consistent Attention Weighted Triplet Loss is designed to integrate spatial attention awareness into both optimization and matching stages of local descriptors learning. Third, Local Features Detection with Feature Pyramid is given to obtain more stable and accurate keypoints localization. With the above innovations, the performance of our MTLDesc significantly surpasses the prior state-of-the-art local descriptors on HPatches, Aachen Day-Night localization and InLoc indoor localization benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional methods detect and match tentative local features across the whole images, with heuristic consistency checks to guarantee reliable matches. In this paper, we introduce a novel Overlap Estimation method conditioned on image pairs with TRansformer, named OETR, to constrain local feature matching in the commonly visible region. OETR performs overlap estimation in a two-step process of feature correlation and then overlap regression. As a preprocessing module, OETR can be plugged into any existing local feature detection and matching pipeline, to mitigate potential view angle or scale variance. Intensive experiments show that OETR can boost state-of-the-art local feature matching performance substantially, especially for image pairs with small shared regions.

Regardless of the application, the basic concept is the same: data collected in early stages of an experiment, data from past similar experiments, and/or data simulated for the upcoming experiment are used to train machine learning models that, in effect, learn specific characteristics of those data; these models are then used to process subsequent data more efficiently than would general-purpose models that lack knowledge of the specific dataset or data class. Thus, a key challenge is to be able to train models with sufficient rapidity that they can be deployed and used within useful timescales. We describe here how specialized data center AI (DCAI) systems can be used for this purpose through a geographically distributed workflow. Experiments show that although there are data movement cost and service overhead to use remote DCAI systems for DNN training, the turnaround time is still less than 1/30 of using a locally deploy-able GPU.</p></details> |  | None |

We extend monocular Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) to a stereo system by optimizing the scale of the 3D points to minimize photometric error for the stereo configuration, which yields a computationally efficient and robust method compared to conventional stereo matching. We further extend it to a full SLAM system with loop closure to reduce accumulated errors. With the assumption of forward camera motion, we imitate a LiDAR scan using the 3D points obtained from the visual odometry and adapt a LiDAR descriptor for place recognition to facilitate more efficient detection of loop closures. Afterward, we estimate the relative pose using direct alignment by minimizing the photometric error for potential loop closures. Optionally, further improvement over direct alignment is achieved by using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Lastly, we optimize a pose graph to improve SLAM accuracy globally. By avoiding feature detection or matching in our SLAM system, we ensure high computational efficiency and robustness.

However, either of these approaches requires tedious configurations in boxes. In this paper, we provide a new perspective where detecting objects is motivated as a high-level semantic feature detection task. Like edges, corners, blobs and other feature detectors, the proposed detector scans for feature points all over the image, for which the convolution is naturally suited. However, unlike these traditional low-level features, the proposed detector goes for a higher-level abstraction, that is, we are looking for central points where there are objects, and modern deep models are already capable of such a high-level semantic abstraction. Besides, like blob detection, we also predict the scales of the central points, which is also a straightforward convolution. Therefore, in this paper, pedestrian and face detection is simplified as a straightforward center and scale prediction task through convolutions. This way, the proposed method enjoys a box-free setting. Though structurally simple, it presents competitive accuracy on several challenging benchmarks, including pedestrian detection and face detection. Furthermore, a cross-dataset evaluation is performed, demonstrating a superior generalization ability of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose FilTag, an approach to effectively explain CNNs even to non-experts. The idea is that when images of a class frequently activate a convolutional filter, then that filter is tagged with that class. These tags provide an explanation to a reference of a class-specific feature detected by the filter. Based on the tagging, individual image classifications can then be intuitively explained in terms of the tags of the filters that the input image activates. Finally, we show that the tags are helpful in analyzing classification errors caused by noisy input images and that the tags can be further processed by machines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mask-Guided Feature Extraction and Augmentation for Ultra-Fine-Grained Visual Categorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07755v1)** | 2021-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) problems have been greatly developed in the past years, the Ultra-fine-grained visual categorization (Ultra-FGVC) problems have been understudied. FGVC aims at classifying objects from the same species (very similar categories), while the Ultra-FGVC targets at more challenging problems of classifying images at an ultra-fine granularity where even human experts may fail to identify the visual difference. The challenges for Ultra-FGVC mainly comes from two aspects: one is that the Ultra-FGVC often arises overfitting problems due to the lack of training samples; and another lies in that the inter-class variance among images is much smaller than normal FGVC tasks, which makes it difficult to learn discriminative features for each class. To solve these challenges, a mask-guided feature extraction and feature augmentation method is proposed in this paper to extract discriminative and informative regions of images which are then used to augment the original feature map. The advantage of the proposed method is that the feature detection and extraction model only requires a small amount of target region samples with bounding boxes for training, then it can automatically locate the target area for a large number of images in the dataset at a high detection accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets and ten state-of-the-art benchmark methods consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both visually and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted by DICTA2021</p></details> | None |
| **[Combining GEDI and Sentinel-2 for wall-to-wall mapping of tall and short crops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06972v1)** | 2021-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High resolution crop type maps are an important tool for improving food security, and remote sensing is increasingly used to create such maps in regions that possess ground truth labels for model training. However, these labels are absent in many regions, and models trained in other regions on typical satellite features, such as those from optical sensors, often exhibit low performance when transferred. Here we explore the use of NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar instrument, combined with Sentinel-2 optical data, for crop type mapping. Using data from three major cropped regions (in China, France, and the United States) we first demonstrate that GEDI energy profiles are capable of reliably distinguishing maize, a crop typically above 2m in height, from crops like rice and soybean that are shorter. We further show that these GEDI profiles provide much more invariant features across geographies compared to spectral and phenological features detected by passive optical sensors. GEDI is able to distinguish maize from other crops within each region with accuracies higher than 84%, and able to transfer across regions with accuracies higher than 82% compared to 64% for transfer of optical features. Finally, we show that GEDI profiles can be used to generate training labels for models based on optical imagery from Sentinel-2, thereby enabling the creation of 10m wall-to-wall maps of tall versus short crops in label-scarce regions. As maize is the second most widely grown crop in the world and often the only tall crop grown within a landscape, we conclude that GEDI offers great promise for improving global crop type maps.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Feature-based Event Stereo Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04921v1)** | 2021-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based cameras are biologically inspired sensors that output events, i.e., asynchronous pixel-wise brightness changes in the scene. Their high dynamic range and temporal resolution of a microsecond makes them more reliable than standard cameras in environments of challenging illumination and in high-speed scenarios, thus developing odometry algorithms based solely on event cameras offers exciting new possibilities for autonomous systems and robots. In this paper, we propose a novel stereo visual odometry method for event cameras based on feature detection and matching with careful feature management, while pose estimation is done by reprojection error minimization. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two publicly available datasets: MVSEC sequences captured by an indoor flying drone and DSEC outdoor driving sequences. MVSEC offers accurate ground truth from motion capture, while for DSEC, which does not offer ground truth, in order to obtain a reference trajectory on the standard camera frames we used our SOFT visual odometry, one of the highest ranking algorithms on the KITTI scoreboards. We compared our method to the ESVO method, which is the first and still the only stereo event odometry method, showing on par performance on the MVSEC sequences, while on the DSEC dataset ESVO, unlike our method, was unable to handle outdoor driving scenario with default parameters. Furthermore, two important advantages of our method over ESVO are that it adapts tracking frequency to the asynchronous event rate and does not require initialization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Accepted to European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR) 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Camera Pose Estimation from Points and Lines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03890v1)** | 2021-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perspective-n-Point-and-Line (P$n$PL) algorithms aim at fast, accurate, and robust camera localization with respect to a 3D model from 2D-3D feature correspondences, being a major part of modern robotic and AR/VR systems. Current point-based pose estimation methods use only 2D feature detection uncertainties, and the line-based methods do not take uncertainties into account. In our setup, both 3D coordinates and 2D projections of the features are considered uncertain. We propose PnP(L) solvers based on EPnP and DLS for the uncertainty-aware pose estimation. We also modify motion-only bundle adjustment to take 3D uncertainties into account. We perform exhaustive synthetic and real experiments on two different visual odometry datasets. The new PnP(L) methods outperform the state-of-the-art on real data in isolation, showing an increase in mean translation accuracy by 18% on a representative subset of KITTI, while the new uncertain refinement improves pose accuracy for most of the solvers, e.g. decreasing mean translation error for the EPnP by 16% compared to the standard refinement on the same dataset.

| **[Bayesian Eye Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13387v1)** | 2021-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based eye tracking has been a dominant approach for eye gaze tracking because of its ability to generalize to different subjects, without the need of any training data and eye gaze annotations. Model-based eye tracking, however, is susceptible to eye feature detection errors, in particular for eye tracking in the wild. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian framework for model-based eye tracking. The proposed system consists of a cascade-Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (c-BCNN) to capture the probabilistic relationships between eye appearance and its landmarks, and a geometric eye model to estimate eye gaze from the eye landmarks. Given a testing eye image, the Bayesian framework can generate, through Bayesian inference, the eye gaze distribution without explicit landmark detection and model training, based on which it not only estimates the most likely eye gaze but also its uncertainty. Furthermore, with Bayesian inference instead of point-based inference, our model can not only generalize better to different sub-jects, head poses, and environments but also is robust to image noise and landmark detection errors. Finally, with the estimated gaze uncertainty, we can construct a cascade architecture that allows us to progressively improve gaze estimation accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods, the proposed Bayesian framework demonstrates significant improvement in generalization capability across several benchmark datasets and in accuracy and robustness under challenging real-world conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Deep Image Stitching: Reconstructing Stitched Features to Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12859v1)** | 2021-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional feature-based image stitching technologies rely heavily on feature detection quality, often failing to stitch images with few features or low resolution. The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied due to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To address the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching framework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and unsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an ablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is more suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is introduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the second stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level can be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an unsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from features to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented by a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch, learning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution simultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image stitching is presented and released. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art solutions. Even compared with the supervised solutions, our image stitching quality is still preferred by users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> | None |

The decomposition of the filter-ngram interactions of a convolutional neural network and a linear layer over a pre-trained deep network yields a strong binary sequence labeler, with flexibility in producing predictions at -- and defining loss functions for -- varying label granularities, from the fully-supervised sequence labeling setting to the challenging zero-shot sequence labeling setting, in which we seek token-level predictions but only have document-level labels for training. From this sequence-labeling layer we derive dense representations of the input that can then be matched to instances from training, or a support set with known labels. Such introspection with inference-time decision rules provides a means, in some settings, of making local updates to the model by altering the labels or instances in the support set without re-training the full model. Finally, we construct a particular K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) model from matched exemplar representations that approximates the original model's predictions and is at least as effective a predictor with respect to the ground-truth labels. This additionally yields interpretable heuristics at the token level for determining when predictions are less likely to be reliable, and for screening input dissimilar to the support set. In effect, we show that we can transform the deep network into a simple weighting over exemplars and associated labels, yielding an introspectable -- and modestly updatable -- version of the original model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Conde...</summary><p>Condensed version; 33 pages + appendix</p></details> | None |
| **[Synaptic Integration of Spatiotemporal Features with a Dynamic Neuromorphic Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04924v2)** | 2021-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neurons can perform spatiotemporal feature detection by nonlinear synaptic and dendritic integration of presynaptic spike patterns. Multicompartment models of non-linear dendrites and related neuromorphic circuit designs enable faithful imitation of such dynamic integration processes, but these approaches are also associated with a relatively high computing cost or circuit size. Here, we investigate synaptic integration of spatiotemporal spike patterns with multiple dynamic synapses on point-neurons in the DYNAP-SE neuromorphic processor, which offers a complementary resource-efficient, albeit less flexible, approach to feature detection. We investigate how previously proposed excitatory--inhibitory pairs of dynamic synapses can be combined to integrate multiple inputs, and we generalize that concept to a case in which one inhibitory synapse is combined with multiple excitatory synapses. We characterize the resulting delayed excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) by measuring and analyzing the membrane potentials of the neuromorphic neuronal circuits. We find that biologically relevant EPSP delays, with variability of order 10 milliseconds per neuron, can be realized in the proposed manner by selecting different synapse combinations, thanks to device mismatch. Based on these results, we demonstrate that a single point-neuron with dynamic synapses in the DYNAP-SE can respond selectively to presynaptic spikes with a particular spatiotemporal structure, which enables, for instance, visual feature tuning of single neurons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2020 IEEE.

The precise and in-depth understanding of the videos is a difficult but valuable problem for both platforms and researchers. The existing video understand models do well in object recognition tasks but currently still cannot understand the abstract and contextual features like highlight humor frames in comedy videos. The current industrial works are also mainly focused on the basic category classification task based on the appearances of objects. The feature detection methods for the abstract category remains blank. A data structure that includes the information of video frames, audio spectrum and texts provide a new direction to explore. The multimodal models are proposed to make this in-depth video understanding mission possible. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties in abstract understanding of videos and propose a multimodal structure to obtain state-of-the-art performance in this field. Then we select several benchmarks for multimodal video understanding and apply the most suitable model to find the best performance. At last, we evaluate the overall spotlights and drawbacks of the models and methods in this paper and point out the possible directions for further improvements.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Drifting Features: Detection and evaluation in the context of automatic RRLs identification in VVV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01714v3)** | 2021-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As most of the modern astronomical sky surveys produce data faster than humans can analyze it, Machine Learning (ML) has become a central tool in Astronomy. Modern ML methods can be characterized as highly resistant to some experimental errors. However, small changes on the data over long distances or long periods of time, which cannot be easily detected by statistical methods, can be harmful to these methods. We develop a new strategy to cope with this problem, also using ML methods in an innovative way, to identify these potentially harmful features. We introduce and discuss the notion of Drifting Features, related with small changes in the properties as measured in the data features. We use the identification of RRLs in VVV based on an earlier work and introduce a method for detecting Drifting Features. Our method forces a classifier to learn the tile of origin of diverse sources (mostly stellar 'point sources'), and select the features more relevant to the task of finding candidates to Drifting Features. We show that this method can efficiently identify a reduced set of features that contains useful information about the tile of origin of the sources. For our particular example of detecting RRLs in VVV, we find that Drifting Features are mostly related to color indices. On the other hand, we show that, even if we have a clear set of Drifting Features in our problem, they are mostly insensitive to the identification of RRLs. Drifting Features can be efficiently identified using ML methods. However, in our example, removing Drifting Features does not improve the identification of RRLs.</p></details> |  | None |

Many previous researches focus on GPR image-based feature detection only, and none can process sparse GPR measurements to successfully reconstruct a very fine and detailed 3D model of underground objects for better visualization. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel robotic system to collect GPR data, localize the underground utilities, and reconstruct the underground objects' dense point cloud model. This system is composed of three modules: 1) visual-inertial-based GPR data collection module, which tags the GPR measurements with positioning information provided by an omnidirectional robot; 2) a deep neural network (DNN) migration module to interpret the raw GPR B-scan image into a cross-section of object model; 3) a DNN-based 3D reconstruction module, i.e., GPRNet, to generate underground utility model with the fine 3D point cloud. In this paper, both the quantitative and qualitative experiment results verify our method that can generate a dense and complete point cloud model of pipe-shaped utilities based on a sparse input, i.e., GPR raw data incompleteness and various noise. The experiment results on synthetic data and field test data further support the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning to Recognize Dialect Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12707v3)** | 2021-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building NLP systems that serve everyone requires accounting for dialect differences. But dialects are not monolithic entities: rather, distinctions between and within dialects are captured by the presence, absence, and frequency of dozens of dialect features in speech and text, such as the deletion of the copula in "He {} running". In this paper, we introduce the task of dialect feature detection, and present two multitask learning approaches, both based on pretrained transformers. For most dialects, large-scale annotated corpora for these features are unavailable, making it difficult to train recognizers. We train our models on a small number of minimal pairs, building on how linguists typically define dialect features. Evaluation on a test set of 22 dialect features of Indian English demonstrates that these models learn to recognize many features with high accuracy, and that a few minimal pairs can be as effective for training as thousands of labeled examples. We also demonstrate the downstream applicability of dialect feature detection both as a measure of dialect density and as a dialect classifier.</p></details> | NAACL camera-ready | None |

While different aspects of the process have been extensively studied, as the lens adaptation or the feature detection, some other,as the feature fusion, have been mostly left aside. In this work we elaborate on the fusion of early vision primitives using generalizations of the Choquet integral, and novel aggregation operators that have been extensively studied in recent years. We propose to use generalizations of the Choquet integral to sensibly fuse elementary edge cues, in an attempt to model the behaviour of neurons in the early visual cortex. Our proposal leads to a full-framed edge detection algorithm, whose performance is put to the test in state-of-the-art boundary detection datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Online Feature Screening for Data Streams with Concept Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02883v1)** | 2021-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Screening feature selection methods are often used as a preprocessing step for reducing the number of variables before training step. Traditional screening methods only focus on dealing with complete high dimensional datasets. Modern datasets not only have higher dimension and larger sample size, but also have properties such as streaming input, sparsity and concept drift. Therefore a considerable number of online feature selection methods were introduced to handle these kind of problems in recent years. Online screening methods are one of the categories of online feature selection methods. The methods that we proposed in this research are capable of handling all three situations mentioned above. Our research study focuses on classification datasets. Our experiments show proposed methods can generate the same feature importance as their offline version with faster speed and less storage consumption. Furthermore, the results show that online screening methods with integrated model adaptation have a higher true feature detection rate than without model adaptation on data streams with the concept drift property. Among the two large real datasets that potentially have the concept drift property, online screening methods with model adaptation show advantages in either saving computing time and space, reducing model complexity, or improving prediction accuracy.</p></details> | 8 figures, 30 pages | None |

Instead of performing image feature detection, description, and matching sequentially, we propose to first establish pixel-wise dense matches at a coarse level and later refine the good matches at a fine level. In contrast to dense methods that use a cost volume to search correspondences, we use self and cross attention layers in Transformer to obtain feature descriptors that are conditioned on both images. The global receptive field provided by Transformer enables our method to produce dense matches in low-texture areas, where feature detectors usually struggle to produce repeatable interest points. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that LoFTR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. LoFTR also ranks first on two public benchmarks of visual localization among the published methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2021.

Prior works have used the Manhattan World (MW) assumption to estimate low-drift camera pose, in turn limiting the applications of such systems. This paper, in contrast, proposes a novel approach delivering robust tracking in MW and non-MW environments. We check orthogonal relations between planes to directly detect Manhattan Frames, modeling the scene as a Mixture of Manhattan Frames. For MW scenes, we decouple pose estimation and provide a novel drift-free rotation estimation based on Manhattan Frame observations. For translation estimation in MW scenes and full camera pose estimation in non-MW scenes, we make use of point, line and plane features for robust tracking in challenging scenes. %mapping Additionally, by exploiting plane features detected in each frame, we also propose an efficient surfel-based dense mapping strategy, which divides each image into planar and non-planar regions. Planar surfels are initialized directly from sparse planes in our map while non-planar surfels are built by extracting superpixels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarks for pose estimation, drift and reconstruction accuracy, achieving superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We will open-source our code in the future.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently emerged correspondence networks propose to perform those steps inside a single network but suffer from low matching resolution due to the memory bottleneck. In this work, we propose a new perspective to estimate correspondences in a detect-to-refine manner, where we first predict patch-level match proposals and then refine them. We present Patch2Pix, a novel refinement network that refines match proposals by regressing pixel-level matches from the local regions defined by those proposals and jointly rejecting outlier matches with confidence scores. Patch2Pix is weakly supervised to learn correspondences that are consistent with the epipolar geometry of an input image pair. We show that our refinement network significantly improves the performance of correspondence networks on image matching, homography estimation, and localization tasks. In addition, we show that our learned refinement generalizes to fully-supervised methods without re-training, which leads us to state-of-the-art localization performance.

To make a lightweight the algorithm, most SLAM systems rely on feature detection from images for vision SLAM or point cloud for laser-based methods. Feature detection through a 3D point cloud becomes a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a feature detection method by projecting a 3D point cloud to form an image and apply the vision-based feature detection technique. The proposed method gives repeatable and stable features in a variety of environments. Based on such features, we build a 6-DOF SLAM system consisting of tracking, mapping, and loop closure threads. For loop detection, we employ a 2-step approach i.e. nearest key-frames detection and loop candidate verification by matching features extracted from rasterized LIDAR images. Furthermore, we utilize a key-frame structure to achieve a lightweight SLAM system. The proposed system is evaluated with implementation on the KITTI dataset and the University of Michigan Ford Campus dataset. Through experimental results, we show that the algorithm presented in this paper can substantially reduce the computational cost of feature detection from the point cloud and the whole SLAM system while giving accurate results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, applications of deep learning in experimental domains are often limited by the out-of-distribution drift between the experiments, where the network trained for one set of imaging conditions becomes sub-optimal for different ones. This limitation is particularly stringent in the quest to have an automated experiment setting, where retraining or transfer learning becomes impractical due to the need for human intervention and associated latencies. Here we explore the reproducibility of deep learning for feature extraction in atom-resolved electron microscopy and introduce workflows based on ensemble learning and iterative training to greatly improve feature detection. This approach both allows incorporating uncertainty quantification into the deep learning analysis and also enables rapid automated experimental workflows where retraining of the network to compensate for out-of-distribution drift due to subtle change in imaging conditions is substituted for a human operator or programmatic selection of networks from the ensemble. This methodology can be further applied to machine learning workflows in other imaging areas including optical and chemical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add s...</summary><p>Add supplemental material</p></details> | None |
| **[Group Linear non-Gaussian Component Analysis with Applications to Neuroimaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04809v1)** | 2021-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Independent component analysis (ICA) is an unsupervised learning method popular in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Group ICA has been used to search for biomarkers in neurological disorders including autism spectrum disorder and dementia. However, current methods use a principal component analysis (PCA) step that may remove low-variance features. Linear non-Gaussian component analysis (LNGCA) enables simultaneous dimension reduction and feature estimation including low-variance features in single-subject fMRI. We present a group LNGCA model to extract group components shared by more than one subject and subject-specific components. To determine the total number of components in each subject, we propose a parametric resampling test that samples spatially correlated Gaussian noise to match the spatial dependence observed in data. In simulations, our estimated group components achieve higher accuracy compared to group ICA. We apply our method to a resting-state fMRI study on autism spectrum disorder in 342 children (252 typically developing, 90 with autism), where the group signals include resting-state networks. We find examples of group components that appear to exhibit different levels of temporal engagement in autism versus typically developing children, as revealed using group LNGCA. This novel approach to matrix decomposition is a promising direction for feature detection in neuroimaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Computer Stereo Vision for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03194v2)** | 2020-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important component of autonomous systems, autonomous car perception has had a big leap with recent advances in parallel computing architectures. With the use of tiny but full-feature embedded supercomputers, computer stereo vision has been prevalently applied in autonomous cars for depth perception. The two key aspects of computer stereo vision are speed and accuracy. They are both desirable but conflicting properties, as the algorithms with better disparity accuracy usually have higher computational complexity. Therefore, the main aim of developing a computer stereo vision algorithm for resource-limited hardware is to improve the trade-off between speed and accuracy. In this chapter, we introduce both the hardware and software aspects of computer stereo vision for autonomous car systems. Then, we discuss four autonomous car perception tasks, including 1) visual feature detection, description and matching, 2) 3D information acquisition, 3) object detection/recognition and 4) semantic image segmentation. The principles of computer stereo vision and parallel computing on multi-threading CPU and GPU architectures are then detailed.</p></details> | Book chapter | None |
| **[Learning Edge-Preserved Image Stitching from Large-Baseline Deep Homography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06194v1)** | 2020-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image stitching is a classical and crucial technique in computer vision, which aims to generate the image with a wide field of view. The traditional methods heavily depend on the feature detection and require that scene features be dense and evenly distributed in the image, leading to varying ghosting effects and poor robustness. Learning methods usually suffer from fixed view and input size limitations, showing a lack of generalization ability on other real datasets. In this paper, we propose an image stitching learning framework, which consists of a large-baseline deep homography module and an edge-preserved deformation module. First, we propose a large-baseline deep homography module to estimate the accurate projective transformation between the reference image and the target image in different scales of features. After that, an edge-preserved deformation module is designed to learn the deformation rules of image stitching from edge to content, eliminating the ghosting effects as much as possible. In particular, the proposed learning framework can stitch images of arbitrary views and input sizes, thus contribute to a supervised deep image stitching method with excellent generalization capability in other real images. Experimental results demonstrate that our homography module significantly outperforms the existing deep homography methods in the large baseline scenes. In image stitching, our method is superior to the existing learning method and shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art traditional methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures | None |

However, most thermal odometry methods are purely based on classical feature extractors, which is difficult to establish robust correspondences in successive frames due to sudden photometric changes and large thermal noise. To solve this problem, we propose ThermalPoint, a lightweight feature detection network specifically tailored for producing keypoints on thermal images, providing notable anti-noise improvements compared with other state-of-the-art methods. After that, we combine ThermalPoint with a novel radiometric feature tracking method, which directly makes use of full radiometric data and establishes reliable correspondences between sequential frames. Finally, taking advantage of an optimization-based visual-inertial framework, a deep feature-based thermal-inertial odometry (TP-TIO) framework is proposed and evaluated thoroughly in various visually degraded environments. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art visual and laser odometry methods in smoke-filled environments and achieves competitive accuracy in normal environments.</p></details> |  | None |

This technique can be applied to various videos, live streaming apps, augmented and virtual reality settings to provide an interactive and immersive user experience. To support such a perspective-accurate representation, we implemented computer vision algorithms for feature detection and correspondence matching. To constrain the solutions, we incorporated an automatically tuning scaling factor upon the homography transform matrix such that each image frame follows a smooth transition with the user in sight. The system is a real-time rendering framework where users can engage their real-life presence with the virtual space.</p></details> | IJCAI 2020 | None |
| **[On the Realization and Analysis of Circular Harmonic Transforms for Feature Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12165v5)** | 2020-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circular-harmonic spectra are a compact representation of local image features in two dimensions. It is well known that the computational complexity of such transforms is greatly reduced when polar separability is exploited in steerable filter-banks. Further simplifications are possible when Cartesian separability is incorporated using the radial apodization (i.e. weight, window, or taper) described here, as a consequence of the Laguerre/Hermite correspondence over polar/Cartesian coordinates. The chosen form also mitigates undesirable discretization artefacts due to angular aliasing. The possible utility of circular-harmonic spectra for the description of simple features is illustrated using real data from an airborne electro-optic sensor. The spectrum is deployed in a test-statistic to detect and characterize corners of arbitrary angle and orientation (i.e. wedges). The test-statistic considers uncertainty due to finite sampling and clutter/noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>A new...</summary><p>A new section on parallel software implementation (MATLAB, C++ and CUDA) was added to this draft version.

The key step involves peptide feature detection in LC-MS map, along with its charge and intensity. Existing heuristic algorithms suffer from inaccurate parameters since different settings of the parameters result in significantly different outcomes. Therefore, we propose PointIso, to serve the necessity of an automated system for peptide feature detection that is able to find out the proper parameters itself, and is easily adaptable to different types of datasets. It consists of an attention based scanning step for segmenting the multi-isotopic pattern of peptide features along with charge and a sequence classification step for grouping those isotopes into potential peptide features. PointIso is the first point cloud based, arbitrary-precision deep learning network to address the problem and achieves 98% detection of high quality MS/MS identifications in a benchmark dataset, which is higher than several other widely used algorithms. Besides contributing to the proteomics study, we believe our novel segmentation technique should serve the general image processing domain as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (main text) with 10 figures, then supplementary material of about 5 pages. preprint of journal submission</p></details> | None |

It is not only robust to calculate the partitioning point to separate the curve logically, but also robust to calculate the clustering center of each part of the separated curve. SDD has been proposed for image segmentation and it outperforms all existing image segmentation methods. For verification purpose, we have made the Matlab codes of comparing SDD method with existing image segmentation methods freely available at Matlab Central. The contour of the object is similar to the histogram of the image. Thus, feature detection by SDD from the contour of the object is also feasible. In this letter, SDD features are defined and they form the sparse representation of the object contour. The reference model of each object is built based on the SDD features and then model matching is used for on line object recognition. The experimental results are very encouraging. For the gesture recognition, SDD achieved 100% accuracy for two public datasets: the NUS dataset and the near-infrared dataset. For the object recognition, SDD achieved 100% accuracy for the Kimia 99 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Retaining Image Feature Matching Performance Under Low Light Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00842v1)** | 2020-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Poor image quality in low light images may result in a reduced number of feature matching between images. In this paper, we investigate the performance of feature extraction algorithms in low light environments. To find an optimal setting to retain feature matching performance in low light images, we look into the effect of changing feature acceptance threshold for feature detector and adding pre-processing in the form of Low Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) prior to feature detection. We observe that even in low light images, feature matching using traditional hand-crafted feature detectors still performs reasonably well by lowering the threshold parameter. We also show that applying Low Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) algorithms can improve feature matching even more when paired with the right feature extraction algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCAS 2020 - 20th International Conference on Control, Robotics, and Systems</p></details> | None |

Through this work, the authors extract information on such features from a popular open-source music corpus and explored new recognition techniques, by applying unsupervised Hebbian learning techniques on their single-layer neural network using the same dataset. The authors show the detailed empirical findings to simulate how such an algorithm can help a single layer feedforward network in training for music feature learning as patterns. The unsupervised training algorithm enhances their proposed neural network to achieve an accuracy of 90.36% for successful music feature detection. For comparative analysis against similar tasks, authors put their results with the likes of several previous benchmark works. They further discuss the limitations and thorough error analysis of their work. The authors hope to discover and gather new information about this particular classification technique and its performance, and further understand future potential directions and prospects that could improve the art of computational music feature recognition.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Implications on Feature Detection when using the Benefit-Cost Ratio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05163v2)** | 2020-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many practical machine learning applications, there are two objectives: one is to maximize predictive accuracy and the other is to minimize costs of the resulting model. These costs of individual features may be financial costs, but can also refer to other aspects, like for example evaluation time. Feature selection addresses both objectives, as it reduces the number of features and can improve the generalization ability of the model. If costs differ between features, the feature selection needs to trade-off the individual benefit and cost of each feature. A popular trade-off choice is the ratio of both, the BCR (benefit-cost ratio). In this paper we analyze implications of using this measure with special focus to the ability to distinguish relevant features from noise. We perform a simulation study for different cost and data settings and obtain detection rates of relevant features and empirical distributions of the trade-off ratio. Our simulation study exposed a clear impact of the cost setting on the detection rate. In situations with large cost differences and small effect sizes, the BCR missed relevant features and preferred cheap noise features. We conclude that a trade-off between predictive performance and costs without a controlling hyperparameter can easily overemphasize very cheap noise features. While the simple benefit-cost ratio offers an easy solution to incorporate costs, it is important to be aware of its risks. Avoiding costs close to 0, rescaling large cost differences, or using a hyperparameter trade-off are ways to counteract the adverse effects exposed in this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: A...</summary><p>v2: Added ancillary files and corrected floating of figures. 10 pages, 2 figures, submitted to SN Computer Science</p></details> | None |
| **[Event-based Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08405v3)** | 2020-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that differ from conventional frame cameras: Instead of capturing images at a fixed rate, they asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes, and output a stream of events that encode the time, location and sign of the brightness changes. Event cameras offer attractive properties compared to traditional cameras: high temporal resolution (in the order of microseconds), very high dynamic range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth (on the order of kHz) resulting in reduced motion blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision in challenging scenarios for traditional cameras, such as low-latency, high speed, and high dynamic range. However, novel methods are required to process the unconventional output of these sensors in order to unlock their potential. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of event-based vision, with a focus on the applications and the algorithms developed to unlock the outstanding properties of event cameras. We present event cameras from their working principle, the actual sensors that are available and the tasks that they have been used for, from low-level vision (feature detection and tracking, optic flow, etc.) to high-level vision (reconstruction, segmentation, recognition). We also discuss the techniques developed to process events, including learning-based techniques, as well as specialized processors for these novel sensors, such as spiking neural networks. Additionally, we highlight the challenges that remain to be tackled and the opportunities that lie ahead in the search for a more efficient, bio-inspired way for machines to perceive and interact with the world.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Faster than FAST: GPU-Accelerated Frontend for High-Speed VIO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13493v3)** | 2020-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent introduction of powerful embedded graphics processing units (GPUs) has allowed for unforeseen improvements in real-time computer vision applications. It has enabled algorithms to run onboard, well above the standard video rates, yielding not only higher information processing capability, but also reduced latency. This work focuses on the applicability of efficient low-level, GPU hardware-specific instructions to improve on existing computer vision algorithms in the field of visual-inertial odometry (VIO). While most steps of a VIO pipeline work on visual features, they rely on image data for detection and tracking, of which both steps are well suited for parallelization. Especially non-maxima suppression and the subsequent feature selection are prominent contributors to the overall image processing latency. Our work first revisits the problem of non-maxima suppression for feature detection specifically on GPUs, and proposes a solution that selects local response maxima, imposes spatial feature distribution, and extracts features simultaneously. Our second contribution introduces an enhanced FAST feature detector that applies the aforementioned non-maxima suppression method. Finally, we compare our method to other state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations, where we always outperform all of them in feature tracking and detection, resulting in over 1000fps throughput on an embedded Jetson TX2 platform. Additionally, we demonstrate our work integrated in a VIO pipeline achieving a metric state estimation at ~200fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2020.

| **[Multi-View Optimization of Local Feature Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08348v2)** | 2020-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the problem of refining the geometry of local image features from multiple views without known scene or camera geometry. Current approaches to local feature detection are inherently limited in their keypoint localization accuracy because they only operate on a single view. This limitation has a negative impact on downstream tasks such as Structure-from-Motion, where inaccurate keypoints lead to large errors in triangulation and camera localization. Our proposed method naturally complements the traditional feature extraction and matching paradigm. We first estimate local geometric transformations between tentative matches and then optimize the keypoint locations over multiple views jointly according to a non-linear least squares formulation. Throughout a variety of experiments, we show that our method consistently improves the triangulation and camera localization performance for both hand-crafted and learned local features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2020. 28 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

To this end, we design a Siamese network that jointly learns 3D local feature detection and description directly from raw 3D points. It integrates FlexConv and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) to assure that the learned local descriptor captures multi-level geometric information and channel-wise relations. For detecting 3D keypoints we predict the discriminativeness of the local descriptors in an unsupervised manner. We generate the global descriptor by directly aggregating the learned local descriptors with an effective attention mechanism. In this way, local and global 3D descriptors are inferred in one single forward pass. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results for both global point cloud retrieval and local point cloud registration in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. To validate the generalizability and robustness of our 3D keypoints, we demonstrate that our method also performs favorably without fine-tuning on the registration of point clouds that were generated by a visual SLAM system.

While modern day transformers are beneficial in composing features, they lack the fundamental problems of selecting and understanding of the contents. As the feature length increases, it becomes increasingly important to include provisions for improved capturing of the pertinent contents. In this work, we have introduced a new concept of Self-Aware Composition Transformer (SACT) that is capable of generating Multinomial Attention (MultAtt) which is a way of generating distributions of various combinations of frames. Also, multi-head attention transformer works on the principle of combining all possible contents for attention, which is good for natural language classification, but has limitations for video captioning. Video contents have repetitions and require parsing of important contents for better content composition. In this work, we have introduced SACT for more selective attention and combined them for different attention heads for better capturing of the usable contents for any applications. To address the problem of diversification and encourage selective utilization, we propose the Self-Aware Composition Transformer model for dense video captioning and apply the technique on two benchmark datasets like ActivityNet and YouCookII.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by techniques in cartography and computer graphics, we render a spherical image to a set of distortion-mitigated, locally-planar image grids tangent to a subdivided icosahedron. By varying the resolution of these grids independently of the subdivision level, we can effectively represent high resolution spherical images while still benefiting from the low-distortion icosahedral spherical approximation. We show that training standard convolutional neural networks on tangent images compares favorably to the many specialized spherical convolutional kernels that have been developed, while also scaling efficiently to handle significantly higher spherical resolutions. Furthermore, because our approach does not require specialized kernels, we show that we can transfer networks trained on perspective images to spherical data without fine-tuning and with limited performance drop-off. Finally, we demonstrate that tangent images can be used to improve the quality of sparse feature detection on spherical images, illustrating its usefulness for traditional computer vision tasks like structure-from-motion and SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version of CVPR 2020 publication (9 pages, 13 pages supplementary).

| **[Navigation in the Presence of Obstacles for an Agile Autonomous Underwater Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11750v2)** | 2020-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation underwater traditionally is done by keeping a safe distance from obstacles, resulting in "fly-overs" of the area of interest. Movement of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through a cluttered space, such as a shipwreck or a decorated cave, is an extremely challenging problem that has not been addressed in the past. This paper proposes a novel navigation framework utilizing an enhanced version of Trajopt for fast 3D path-optimization planning for AUVs. A sampling-based correction procedure ensures that the planning is not constrained by local minima, enabling navigation through narrow spaces. Two different modalities are proposed: planning with a known map results in efficient trajectories through cluttered spaces; operating in an unknown environment utilizes the point cloud from the visual features detected to navigate efficiently while avoiding the detected obstacles. The proposed approach is rigorously tested, both on simulation and in-pool experiments, proven to be fast enough to enable safe real-time 3D autonomous navigation for an AUV.</p></details> | ICRA 2020 | None |

With a more brain-like processing paradigm, spiking neurons are more promising for improvements on efficiency and computational capability. They extend the computation of traditional neurons with an additional dimension of time carried by all-or-nothing spikes. Could one benefit from both the accuracy of analog values and the time-processing capability of spikes? In this paper, we introduce a concept of augmented spikes to carry complementary information with spike coefficients in addition to spike latencies. New augmented spiking neuron model and synaptic learning rules are proposed to process and learn patterns of augmented spikes. We provide systematic insight into the properties and characteristics of our methods, including classification of augmented spike patterns, learning capacity, construction of causality, feature detection, robustness and applicability to practical tasks such as acoustic and visual pattern recognition. The remarkable results highlight the effectiveness and potential merits of our methods. Importantly, our augmented approaches are versatile and can be easily generalized to other spike-based systems, contributing to a potential development for them including neuromorphic computing.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |
