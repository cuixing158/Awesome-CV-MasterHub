| **[Learning to Borrow Features for Improved Detection of Small Objects in Single-Shot Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00044v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting small objects remains a significant challenge in single-shot object detectors due to the inherent trade-off between spatial resolution and semantic richness in convolutional feature maps. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that enables small object representations to "borrow" discriminative features from larger, semantically richer instances within the same class. Our architecture introduces three key components: the Feature Matching Block (FMB) to identify semantically similar descriptors across layers, the Feature Representing Block (FRB) to generate enhanced shallow features through weighted aggregation, and the Feature Fusion Block (FFB) to refine feature maps by integrating original, borrowed, and context information. Built upon the SSD framework, our method improves the descriptive capacity of shallow layers while maintaining real-time detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts small object detection accuracy over baseline methods, offering a promising direction for robust object detection in complex visual environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Marine Snow Removal Using Internally Generated Pseudo Ground Truth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19289v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater videos often suffer from degraded quality due to light absorption, scattering, and various noise sources. Among these, marine snow, which is suspended organic particles appearing as bright spots or noise, significantly impacts machine vision tasks, particularly those involving feature matching. Existing methods for removing marine snow are ineffective due to the lack of paired training data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel enhancement framework that introduces a new approach for generating paired datasets from raw underwater videos. The resulting dataset consists of paired images of generated snowy and snow, free underwater videos, enabling supervised training for video enhancement. We describe the dataset creation process, highlight its key characteristics, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing underwater image restoration in the absence of ground truth.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PRaDA: Projective Radial Distortion Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16499v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the problem of automatic calibration of radially distorted cameras in challenging conditions. Accurately determining distortion parameters typically requires either 1) solving the full Structure from Motion (SfM) problem involving camera poses, 3D points, and the distortion parameters, which is only possible if many images with sufficient overlap are provided, or 2) relying heavily on learning-based methods that are comparatively less accurate. In this work, we demonstrate that distortion calibration can be decoupled from 3D reconstruction, maintaining the accuracy of SfM-based methods while avoiding many of the associated complexities. This is achieved by working in Projective Space, where the geometry is unique up to a homography, which encapsulates all camera parameters except for distortion. Our proposed method, Projective Radial Distortion Averaging, averages multiple distortion estimates in a fully projective framework without creating 3d points and full bundle adjustment. By relying on pairwise projective relations, our methods support any feature-matching approaches without constructing point tracks across multiple images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025. 8 pages + references</p></details> | None |
| **[FreeGraftor: Training-Free Cross-Image Feature Grafting for Subject-Driven Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15958v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel scenes that faithfully preserve subject identity from reference images while adhering to textual guidance, yet existing methods struggle with a critical trade-off between fidelity and efficiency. Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor employs semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated image. Additionally, our framework incorporates a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve geometry priors of reference subjects for robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment.

| **[Flow Intelligence: Robust Feature Matching via Temporal Signature Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11949v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching across video streams remains a cornerstone challenge in computer vision. Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest in robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While traditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down when faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning methods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain constrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational demands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves beyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively. Instead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion signatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal motion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve natural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while remaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also requires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature detection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence enables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Search is All You Need for Few-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11895v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) has emerged as a crucial yet challenging task in industrial inspection, where normal distribution modeling must be accomplished with only a few normal images. While existing approaches typically employ multi-modal foundation models combining language and vision modalities for prompt-guided anomaly detection, these methods often demand sophisticated prompt engineering and extensive manual tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate that a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD scenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential components: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and discriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support augmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to address the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature integration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency local details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual memory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection. Extensive evaluations across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD benchmarks demonstrate VisionAD's exceptional performance. Using only 1 normal images as support, our method achieves remarkable image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8% respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins (+1.6%, +3.2%, and +1.4%). The training-free nature and superior few-shot capabilities of VisionAD make it particularly appealing for real-world applications where samples are scarce or expensive to obtain.

| **[R-SCoRe: Revisiting Scene Coordinate Regression for Robust Large-Scale Visual Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01421v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based visual localization methods that use scene coordinate regression (SCR) offer the advantage of smaller map sizes. However, on datasets with complex illumination changes or image-level ambiguities, it remains a less robust alternative to feature matching methods. This work aims to close the gap. We introduce a covisibility graph-based global encoding learning and data augmentation strategy, along with a depth-adjusted reprojection loss to facilitate implicit triangulation. Additionally, we revisit the network architecture and local feature extraction module. Our method achieves state-of-the-art on challenging large-scale datasets without relying on network ensembles or 3D supervision. On Aachen Day-Night, we are 10$\times$ more accurate than previous SCR methods with similar map sizes and require at least 5$\times$ smaller map sizes than any other SCR method while still delivering superior accuracy.

| **[SELC: Self-Supervised Efficient Local Correspondence Learning for Low Quality Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04497v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and stable feature matching is critical for computer vision tasks, particularly in applications such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). While recent learning-based feature matching methods have demonstrated promising performance in challenging spatiotemporal scenarios, they still face inherent trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency in specific settings. In this paper, we propose a lightweight feature matching network designed to establish sparse, stable, and consistent correspondence between multiple frames. The proposed method eliminates the dependency on manual annotations during training and mitigates feature drift through a hybrid self-supervised paradigm. Extensive experiments validate three key advantages: (1) Our method operates without dependency on external prior knowledge and seamlessly incorporates its hybrid training mechanism into original datasets. (2) Benchmarked against state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, our approach maintains equivalent computational efficiency at low-resolution scales while achieving a 2-10x improvement in computational efficiency for high-resolution inputs. (3) Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed hybrid self-supervised scheme effectively mitigates feature drift in long-term tracking while maintaining consistent representation across image sequences.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17648v4)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.

| **[CoMatcher: Multi-View Collaborative Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01872v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a multi-view collaborative matching strategy for reliable track construction in complex scenarios. We observe that the pairwise matching paradigms applied to image set matching often result in ambiguous estimation when the selected independent pairs exhibit significant occlusions or extreme viewpoint changes. This challenge primarily stems from the inherent uncertainty in interpreting intricate 3D structures based on limited two-view observations, as the 3D-to-2D projection leads to significant information loss. To address this, we introduce CoMatcher, a deep multi-view matcher to (i) leverage complementary context cues from different views to form a holistic 3D scene understanding and (ii) utilize cross-view projection consistency to infer a reliable global solution. Building on CoMatcher, we develop a groupwise framework that fully exploits cross-view relationships for large-scale matching tasks. Extensive experiments on various complex scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over the mainstream two-view matching paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, to be published in CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[v-CLR: View-Consistent Learning for Open-World Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01383v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the challenging problem of open-world instance segmentation. Existing works have shown that vanilla visual networks are biased toward learning appearance information, \eg texture, to recognize objects. This implicit bias causes the model to fail in detecting novel objects with unseen textures in the open-world setting. To address this challenge, we propose a learning framework, called view-Consistent LeaRning (v-CLR), which aims to enforce the model to learn appearance-invariant representations for robust instance segmentation. In v-CLR, we first introduce additional views for each image, where the texture undergoes significant alterations while preserving the image's underlying structure. We then encourage the model to learn the appearance-invariant representation by enforcing the consistency between object features across different views, for which we obtain class-agnostic object proposals using off-the-shelf unsupervised models that possess strong object-awareness. These proposals enable cross-view object feature matching, greatly reducing the appearance dependency while enhancing the object-awareness. We thoroughly evaluate our method on public benchmarks under both cross-class and cross-dataset settings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

| **[ForestVO: Enhancing Visual Odometry in Forest Environments through ForestGlue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01261v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in visual odometry systems have improved autonomous navigation; however, challenges persist in complex environments like forests, where dense foliage, variable lighting, and repetitive textures compromise feature correspondence accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four configurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for various sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or SuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |
| **[ADGaussian: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving with Multi-modal Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00437v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach, termed ADGaussian, for generalizable street scene reconstruction. The proposed method enables high-quality rendering from single-view input. Unlike prior Gaussian Splatting methods that primarily focus on geometry refinement, we emphasize the importance of joint optimization of image and depth features for accurate Gaussian prediction. To this end, we first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality, formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature matching strategy coupled with a multi-scale Gaussian decoding model to enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning. Extensive experiments on two large-scale autonomous driving datasets, Waymo and KITTI, demonstrate that our ADGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization capabilities in novel-view shifting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page can be found at https://maggiesong7.github.io/research/ADGaussian/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://maggiesong7.github.io/research) |
| **[SuperEvent: Cross-Modal Learning of Event-based Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00139v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based keypoint detection and matching holds significant potential, enabling the integration of event sensors into highly optimized Visual SLAM systems developed for frame cameras over decades of research. Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

| **[ABC-GS: Alignment-Based Controllable Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22218v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene stylization approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve promising results by optimizing with Nearest Neighbor Feature Matching (NNFM) loss. However, NNFM loss does not consider global style information. In addition, the implicit representation of NeRF limits their fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms. Extensive experiments show that our ABC-GS provides controllability of style transfer and achieves stylization results that are more faithfully aligned with the global style of the chosen artistic reference.

| **[Solving Instance Detection from an Open-World Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00359v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance detection (InsDet) aims to localize specific object instances within a novel scene imagery based on given visual references. Technically, it requires proposal detection to identify all possible object instances, followed by instance-level matching to pinpoint the ones of interest. Its open-world nature supports its broad applications from robotics to AR/VR but also presents significant challenges: methods must generalize to unknown testing data distributions because (1) the testing scene imagery is unseen during training, and (2) there are domain gaps between visual references and detected proposals. Existing methods tackle these challenges by synthesizing diverse training examples or utilizing off-the-shelf foundation models (FMs). However, they only partially capitalize the available open-world information. In contrast, we approach InsDet from an Open-World perspective, introducing our method IDOW. We find that, while pretrained FMs yield high recall in instance detection, they are not specifically optimized for instance-level feature matching. Therefore, we adapt pretrained FMs for improved instance-level matching using open-world data. Our approach incorporates metric learning along with novel data augmentations, which sample distractors as negative examples and synthesize novel-view instances to enrich the visual references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior works, achieving >10 AP over previous results on two recently released challenging benchmark datasets in both conventional and novel instance detection settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[AgRowStitch: A High-fidelity Image Stitching Pipeline for Ground-based Agricultural Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21990v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural imaging often requires individual images to be stitched together into a final mosaic for analysis. However, agricultural images can be particularly challenging to stitch because feature matching across images is difficult due to repeated textures, plants are non-planar, and mosaics built from many images can accumulate errors that cause drift. Although these issues can be mitigated by using georeferenced images or taking images at high altitude, there is no general solution for images taken close to the crop. To address this, we created a user-friendly and open source pipeline for stitching ground-based images of a linear row of crops that does not rely on additional data. First, we use SuperPoint and LightGlue to extract and match features within small batches of images. Then we stitch the images in each batch in series while imposing constraints on the camera movement. After straightening and rescaling each batch mosaic, all batch mosaics are stitched together in series and then straightened into a final mosaic. We tested the pipeline on images collected along 72 m long rows of crops using two different agricultural robots and a camera manually carried over the row. In all three cases, the pipeline produced high-quality mosaics that could be used to georeference real world positions with a mean absolute error of 20 cm. This approach provides accessible leaf-scale stitching to users who need to coarsely georeference positions within a row, but do not have access to accurate positional data or sophisticated imaging systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MESA: Effective Matching Redundancy Reduction by Semantic Area Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00279v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MESA and DMESA as novel feature matching methods, which utilize Segment Anything Model (SAM) to effectively mitigate matching redundancy. The key insight of our methods is to establish implicit-semantic area matching prior to point matching, based on advanced image understanding of SAM. Then, informative area matches with consistent internal semantic are able to undergo dense feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching. Specifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework and first obtains candidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). Then, area matching among the candidates is formulated as graph energy minimization and solved by graphical models derived from AG. To address the efficiency issue of MESA, we further propose DMESA as its dense counterpart, applying a dense matching framework. After candidate areas are identified by AG, DMESA establishes area matches through generating dense matching distributions. The distributions are produced from off-the-shelf patch matching utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model and refined via the Expectation Maximization. With less repetitive computation, DMESA showcases a speed improvement of nearly five times compared to MESA, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our methods are extensively evaluated on five datasets encompassing indoor and outdoor scenes. The results illustrate consistent performance improvements from our methods for five distinct point matching baselines across all datasets. Furthermore, our methods exhibit promise generalization and improved robustness against image resolution variations.

This paper focuses on rotation symmetry, where objects remain unchanged when rotated around a central axis, requiring detection of rotation centers and supporting vertices. Traditional methods relied on hand-crafted feature matching, while recent segmentation models based on convolutional neural networks detect rotation centers but struggle with 3D geometric consistency due to viewpoint distortions. To overcome this, we propose a model that directly predicts rotation centers and vertices in 3D space and projects the results back to 2D while preserving structural integrity. By incorporating a vertex reconstruction stage enforcing 3D geometric priors -- such as equal side lengths and interior angles -- our model enhances robustness and accuracy. Experiments on the DENDI dataset show superior performance in rotation axis detection and validate the impact of 3D priors through ablation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

While image diffusion models have shown remarkable restoration capabilities, their direct application to video leads to temporal inconsistencies, and existing video restoration methods require extensive retraining for different degradation types. Our approach addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a hierarchical latent warping strategy that maintains consistency across both keyframes and local frames, and a hybrid token merging mechanism that adaptively combines optical flow and feature matching. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains the high-quality restoration of base diffusion models but also achieves superior temporal consistency across diverse datasets and degradation conditions, including challenging scenarios like 8$\times$ super-resolution and severe noise. Importantly, our framework works with any image restoration diffusion model, providing a versatile solution for video enhancement without task-specific training or modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jimmycv07.github.io/DiffIR2VR_web/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jimmycv07.github.io/DiffIR2VR_web) |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

STDLoc is a full relocalization pipeline that can achieve accurate relocalization without relying on any pose prior. Unlike previous coarse-to-fine localization methods that require image retrieval first and then feature matching, we propose a novel sparse-to-dense localization paradigm. Based on this scene representation, we introduce a novel matching-oriented Gaussian sampling strategy and a scene-specific detector to achieve efficient and robust initial pose estimation. Furthermore, based on the initial localization results, we align the query feature map to the Gaussian feature field by dense feature matching to enable accurate localization. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that STDLoc outperforms current state-of-the-art localization methods in terms of localization accuracy and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LRSCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Aligning Remote Sensing Image with Longer Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19311v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the technical bottlenecks in handling long text and the "hallucination" issue caused by insufficient short text information in remote sensing vision-language foundation models (VLFM). We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning.

The pose is estimated by aligning a point plane generated from the ground image with a point plane sampled from the aerial image. To generate the ground points, we first map ground image features to a 3D point cloud. Our method then learns to select features along the height dimension to pool the 3D points to a Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) plane. This selection enables us to trace which feature in the ground image contributes to the BEV representation. Next, we sample a set of sparse matches from computed point correspondences between the two point planes and compute their relative pose using Procrustes alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, our method reduces the mean localization error by 28% on the VIGOR cross-area test set. Qualitative results show that our method learns semantically consistent matches across ground and aerial views through weakly supervised learning from the camera pose.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning for Relative Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18671v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relative pose estimation provides a promising way for achieving object-agnostic pose estimation. Despite the success of existing 3D correspondence-based methods, the reliance on explicit feature matching suffers from small overlaps in visible regions and unreliable feature estimation for invisible regions. Inspired by humans' ability to assemble two object parts that have small or no overlapping regions by considering object structure, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning method for Relative Pose Estimation, which consists of two key modules. First, a structure-aware keypoint extraction module is designed to locate a set of kepoints that can represent the structure of objects with different shapes and appearance, under the guidance of a keypoint based image reconstruction loss. Second, a structure-aware correspondence estimation module is designed to model the intra-image and inter-image relationships between keypoints to extract structure-aware features for correspondence estimation. By jointly leveraging these two modules, the proposed method can naturally estimate 3D-3D correspondences for unseen objects without explicit feature matching for precise relative pose estimation. Experimental results on the CO3D, Objaverse and LineMOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods, i.e., with 5.7{\deg}reduction in mean angular error on the CO3D dataset.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization. These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multi-view stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised optimization method with zero-knowledge priors, using direction-based enhancement to ensure multi-view consistency. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both low-light enhancement and 3D Gaussian Splatting.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce an innovative multimodal odometry approach using inputs from GPR, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a wheel encoder. To efficiently address GPR signal noise, we introduce an advanced feature representation called the subsurface feature matrix (SFM). The SFM leverages frequency domain data and identifies peaks within radar scans. Additionally, we propose a novel feature matching method that estimates GPR displacement by aligning SFMs. The integrations from these three input sources are consolidated using a factor graph approach to achieve multimodal robot odometry. Our method has been developed and evaluated with the CMU-GPR public dataset, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and robustness with real-time performance in robotic odometry tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ATOM: Attention Mixer for Efficient Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01373v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in dataset distillation seek to minimize training expenses by generating a condensed synthetic dataset that encapsulates the information present in a larger real dataset. These approaches ultimately aim to attain test accuracy levels akin to those achieved by models trained on the entirety of the original dataset. Previous studies in feature and distribution matching have achieved significant results without incurring the costs of bi-level optimization in the distillation process. Despite their convincing efficiency, many of these methods suffer from marginal downstream performance improvements, limited distillation of contextual information, and subpar cross-architecture generalization. To address these challenges in dataset distillation, we propose the ATtentiOn Mixer (ATOM) module to efficiently distill large datasets using a mixture of channel and spatial-wise attention in the feature matching process. Spatial-wise attention helps guide the learning process based on consistent localization of classes in their respective images, allowing for distillation from a broader receptive field. Meanwhile, channel-wise attention captures the contextual information associated with the class itself, thus making the synthetic image more informative for training. By integrating both types of attention, our ATOM module demonstrates superior performance across various computer vision datasets, including CIFAR10/100 and TinyImagenet. Notably, our method significantly improves performance in scenarios with a low number of images per class, thereby enhancing its potential. Furthermore, we maintain the improvement in cross-architectures and applications such as neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for an oral presentation in CVPR-DD 2024</p></details> | None |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets.

While state-of-the art methods that relies on feature matching have proven to be accurate for visual localization, its requirements for storage and compute are burdens. Scene coordinate regression (SCR) is an alternative approach that remove the barrier for storage by learning to map 2D pixels to 3D scene coordinates. Most popular SCR use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract 2D descriptor, which we would argue that it miss the spatial relationship between pixels. Inspired by the success of vision transformer architecture, we present a new SCR architecture, called A-ScoRe, an Attention-based model which leverage attention on descriptor map level to produce meaningful and high-semantic 2D descriptors. Since the operation is performed on descriptor map, our model can work with multiple data modality whether it is a dense or sparse from depth-map, SLAM to Structure-from-Motion (SfM). This versatility allows A-SCoRe to operate in different kind of environments, conditions and achieve the level of flexibility that is important for mobile robots. Results show our methods achieve comparable performance with State-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark while being light-weighted and much more flexible.

In this paper, we introduce InstantSplat, a novel approach for addressing sparse-view 3D scene reconstruction at lightning-fast speed. InstantSplat employs a self-supervised framework that optimizes 3D scene representation and camera poses by unprojecting 2D pixels into 3D space and aligning them using differentiable neural rendering. The optimization process is initialized with a large-scale trained geometric foundation model, which provides dense priors that yield initial points through model inference, after which we further optimize all scene parameters using photometric errors. To mitigate redundancy introduced by the prior model, we propose a co-visibility-based geometry initialization, and a Gaussian-based bundle adjustment is employed to rapidly adapt both the scene representation and camera parameters without relying on a complex adaptive density control process. Overall, InstantSplat is compatible with multiple point-based representations for view synthesis and surface reconstruction. It achieves an acceleration of over 30x in reconstruction and improves visual quality (SSIM) from 0.3755 to 0.7624 compared to traditional SfM with 3D-GS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://instantsplat.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Compared to classical feature matching, point tracking methods have the key advantage of robustly tracking points under complex camera motion trajectories and over extended periods. However, despite certain improvements in methodologies, current point tracking methods still struggle to track any position in video frames, especially in areas that are texture-less or weakly textured. In this work, we first introduce metrics for evaluating the texture intensity of a 3D object. Using these metrics, we classify the 3D models in ShapeNet into three levels of texture intensity and create GIFT, a challenging synthetic benchmark comprising 1800 indoor video sequences with rich annotations. Unlike existing datasets that assign ground truth points arbitrarily, GIFT precisely anchors ground truth on classified target objects, ensuring that each video corresponds to a specific texture intensity level. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate current methods on GIFT to assess their performance across different texture intensity levels and analyze the impact of texture on point tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning.

However, when handling complex kitting tasks that involve fine-grained orientation alignment, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Histogram Transporter, a novel kitting framework that learns high-precision pick-and-place actions from scratch using only a few demonstrations. First, our method extracts rotation-equivariant orientation histograms (EOHs) from visual observations using an efficient Fourier-based discretization strategy. These EOHs serve a dual purpose: improving picking efficiency by directly modeling action success probabilities over high-resolution orientations and enhancing placing accuracy by serving as local, discriminative feature descriptors for object-to-placement matching. Second, we introduce a subgroup alignment strategy in the place model that compresses the full spectrum of EOHs into a compact orientation representation, enabling efficient feature matching while preserving accuracy. Finally, we examine the proposed framework on the simulated Hand-Tool Kitting Dataset (HTKD), where it outperforms competitive baselines in both success rates and computational efficiency. Further experiments on five Raven-10 tasks exhibits the remarkable adaptability of our approach, with real-robot trials confirming its applicability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review</p></details> | None |
| **[Aligning First, Then Fusing: A Novel Weakly Supervised Multimodal Violence Detection Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07496v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised violence detection refers to the technique of training models to identify violent segments in videos using only video-level labels. Among these approaches, multimodal violence detection, which integrates modalities such as audio and optical flow, holds great potential. Existing methods in this domain primarily focus on designing multimodal fusion models to address modality discrepancies. In contrast, we take a different approach; leveraging the inherent discrepancies across modalities in violence event representation to propose a novel multimodal semantic feature alignment method. This method sparsely maps the semantic features of local, transient, and less informative modalities ( such as audio and optical flow ) into the more informative RGB semantic feature space. Through an iterative process, the method identifies the suitable no-zero feature matching subspace and aligns the modality-specific event representations based on this subspace, enabling the full exploitation of information from all modalities during the subsequent modality fusion stage. Building on this, we design a new weakly supervised violence detection framework that consists of unimodal multiple-instance learning for extracting unimodal semantic features, multimodal alignment, multimodal fusion, and final detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an average precision (AP) of 86.07% on the XD-Violence dataset.

Existing learning-based RANSAC methods utilize deep learning to enhance the robustness of RANSAC against outliers. However, these approaches are trained and tested on the data generated by the same algorithms, leading to limited generalization to out-of-distribution data during inference. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based paradigm that progressively injects noise into ground-truth data, simulating the noisy conditions for training learning-based RANSAC. To enhance data diversity, we incorporate Monte Carlo sampling into the diffusion paradigm, approximating diverse data distributions by introducing different types of randomness at multiple stages. We evaluate our approach in the context of feature matching through comprehensive experiments on the ScanNet and MegaDepth datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our Monte Carlo diffusion mechanism significantly improves the generalization ability of learning-based RANSAC. We also develop extensive ablation studies that highlight the effectiveness of key components in our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Visual feature matching is crucial to vision-based pipelines but remains particularly challenging in natural outdoor settings due to perceptual aliasing. We address this issue in vineyards, where repetitive vine trunks and other natural elements generate ambiguous descriptors that hinder reliable feature matching. We hypothesise that semantic information tied to keypoint positions can alleviate perceptual aliasing by enhancing keypoint descriptor distinctiveness. To this end, we introduce a keypoint semantic integration technique that improves the descriptors in semantically meaningful regions within the image, enabling more accurate differentiation even among visually similar local features. We validate this approach in two vineyard perception tasks: (i) relative pose estimation and (ii) visual localisation. Across all tested keypoint types and descriptors, our method improves matching accuracy by 12.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness over multiple months in challenging vineyard conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/LCAS/GAIA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/LCAS/GAIA) |

While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature Alignment with Equivariant Convolutions for Burst Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08300v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Burst image processing (BIP), which captures and integrates multiple frames into a single high-quality image, is widely used in consumer cameras. As a typical BIP task, Burst Image Super-Resolution (BISR) has achieved notable progress through deep learning in recent years. Existing BISR methods typically involve three key stages: alignment, upsampling, and fusion, often in varying orders and implementations. Among these stages, alignment is particularly critical for ensuring accurate feature matching and further reconstruction. However, existing methods often rely on techniques such as deformable convolutions and optical flow to realize alignment, which either focus only on local transformations or lack theoretical grounding, thereby limiting their performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework for BISR, featuring an equivariant convolution-based alignment, ensuring consistent transformations between the image and feature domains. This enables the alignment transformation to be learned via explicit supervision in the image domain and easily applied in the feature domain in a theoretically sound way, effectively improving alignment accuracy. Additionally, we design an effective reconstruction module with advanced deep architectures for upsampling and fusion to obtain the final BISR result. Extensive experiments on BISR benchmarks show the superior performance of our approach in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose an effective and efficient Spatial-Aware Topological Loss Function that further leverages the information in the original spatial domain of the image to assist the matching of persistent features. Extensive experiments on images of various types of tubular structures show that the proposed method has superior performance in improving the topological accuracy of the segmentation compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing NeRF-based approaches either lack geometric constraints or require extensive storage for feature matching, limiting their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and novel visual localization approach based on the neural implicit map with complementary features. Specifically, to enforce geometric constraints and reduce storage requirements, we implicitly learn a 3D keypoint descriptor field, avoiding the need to explicitly store point-wise features. To further address the semantic ambiguity of descriptors, we introduce additional semantic contextual feature fields, which enhance the quality and reliability of 2D-3D correspondences. Besides, we propose descriptor similarity distribution alignment to minimize the domain gap between 2D and 3D feature spaces during matching. Finally, we construct the matching graph using both complementary descriptors and contextual features to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondences for 6-DoF pose estimation. Compared with the recent NeRF-based approaches, our method achieves a 3$\times$ faster training speed and a 45$\times$ reduction in model storage. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art NeRF-based visual localization methods.

In the refinement stage, a novel lightweight bidirectional axis-based regression head is designed to directly predict subpixel-level correspondences from latent features, avoiding the significant computational cost of explicitly locating keypoints on high-resolution local feature heatmaps.

Precise pose estimation is an important task for mobile robots exploring planetary surfaces, as they operate in GPS-denied environments. Although visual odometry provides accurate localization, it is computationally expensive and can fail in dim or high-contrast lighting. Wheel encoders can also provide odometry estimation, but are prone to slipping on the sandy terrain encountered on Mars. Although traditionally a scientific surveying sensor, GPR has been used on Earth for terrain classification and localization through subsurface feature matching. The Perseverance rover and the upcoming ExoMars rover have GPR sensors already equipped to aid in the search of water and mineral resources. We propose to leverage GPR to aid in Mars rover localization. Specifically, we develop a novel GPR-based deep learning model that predicts 1D relative pose translation. We fuse our GPR pose prediction method with inertial and wheel encoder data in a filtering framework to output rover localization. We perform experiments in a Mars analog environment and demonstrate that our GPR-based displacement predictions both outperform wheel encoders and improve multi-modal filtering estimates in high-slip environments. Lastly, we present the first dataset aimed at GPR-based localization in Mars analog environments, which will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |

However, automating underwater ecosystem management with robotic platforms remains challenging due to the complexities of underwater imagery, which pose significant difficulties for traditional visual localization methods. We propose an integrated pipeline that combines Visual Place Recognition (VPR), feature matching, and image segmentation on video-derived images. This method enables robust identification of revisited areas, estimation of rigid transformations, and downstream analysis of ecosystem changes. Furthermore, we introduce the SQUIDLE+ VPR Benchmark-the first large-scale underwater VPR benchmark designed to leverage an extensive collection of unstructured data from multiple robotic platforms, spanning time intervals from days to years. The dataset encompasses diverse trajectories, arbitrary overlap and diverse seafloor types captured under varying environmental conditions, including differences in depth, lighting, and turbidity.

We propose an innovative approach, Feature Matching Intervention (FMI), which uses a matching procedure to mimic perfect interventions. We define causal latent graphs, extending structural causal models to latent feature space, providing a framework that connects FMI with causal graph learning. Our feature matching procedure emulates perfect interventions within these causal latent graphs. Theoretical results demonstrate that FMI exhibits strong out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability. Experiments further highlight FMI's superior performance in effectively identifying causal features solely from observational data.</p></details> |  | None |

Striking a better balance between performance and efficiency remains a challenge in feature matching. Inspired by the linear complexity O(N) of Mamba, we propose an ultra-lightweight Mamba-based matcher, named JamMa, which converges on a single GPU and achieves an impressive performance-efficiency balance in inference. To unlock the potential of Mamba for feature matching, we propose Joint Mamba with a scan-merge strategy named JEGO, which enables: (1) Joint scan of two images to achieve high-frequency mutual interaction, (2) Efficient scan with skip steps to reduce sequence length, (3) Global receptive field, and (4) Omnidirectional feature representation. With the above properties, the JEGO strategy significantly outperforms the scan-merge strategies proposed in VMamba and EVMamba in the feature matching task. Compared to attention-based sparse and semi-dense matchers, JamMa demonstrates a superior balance between performance and efficiency, delivering better performance with less than 50% of the parameters and FLOPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page: https://leoluxxx.github.io/JamMa-page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://leoluxxx.github.io/JamMa-page) |

A multi-sensor UAV system, integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera, can provide an effective solution to this problem. In this paper, we utilize multi-sensor data to overcome the limitations of conventional orthoimage generation methods in terms of temporal performance, system robustness, and geographic reference accuracy. A prior-pose-optimized feature matching method is introduced to enhance matching speed and accuracy, reducing the number of required features and providing precise references for the Structure from Motion (SfM) process. The proposed method exhibits robustness in low-texture scenes like farmlands, where feature matching is difficult. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate feature matching orthoimage generation in a short time. The proposed drone system effectively aids in farmland detection and management.</p></details> |  | None |

While increasing $k$ improves localisation robustness, it also linearly increases computational cost and runtime, creating a significant bottleneck. This paper investigates the relationship between global and local descriptors, showing that greater similarity between the global descriptors of query and database images increases the proportion of feature matches. Low similarity queries significantly benefit from increasing $k$, while high similarity queries rapidly experience diminishing returns. Building on these observations, we propose an adaptive strategy that adjusts $k$ based on the similarity between the query's global descriptor and those in the database, effectively mitigating the feature-matching bottleneck. Our approach optimizes processing time without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on three indoor and outdoor datasets show that AIR-HLoc reduces feature matching time by up to 30\%, while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy. The results demonstrate that AIR-HLoc facilitates a latency-sensitive localisation system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches typically model unordered matches as a consistency graph and sample consistent matches to generate hypotheses. However, explicit graph construction introduces noise, posing great challenges for handcrafted geometric constraints to render consistency among matches. To overcome this, we propose HyperGCT, a flexible dynamic Hyper-GNN-learned geometric constraint that leverages high-order consistency among 3D correspondences. To our knowledge, HyperGCT is the first method that mines robust geometric constraints from dynamic hypergraphs for 3D registration. By dynamically optimizing the hypergraph through vertex and edge feature aggregation, HyperGCT effectively captures the correlations among correspondences, leading to accurate hypothesis generation. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, KITTI-LC, and ETH show that HyperGCT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our method is robust to graph noise, demonstrating a significant advantage in terms of generalization. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

This can result in an infinite number of variations in palm vein images for a given individual. This paper introduces a novel filtering technique for SIFT-based feature matching, known as the Mean and Median Distance (MMD) Filter. This method evaluates the differences in keypoint coordinates and computes the mean and median in each direction to eliminate incorrect matches. Experiments conducted on the 850nm subset of the CASIA dataset indicate that the proposed MMD filter effectively preserves correct points while reducing false positives detected by other filtering methods. A comparison with existing SIFT-based palm vein recognition systems demonstrates that the proposed MMD filter delivers outstanding performance, achieving lower Equal Error Rate (EER) values.

| **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been used to extract interpretable features from individual layers, aligning these features across layers has remained an open problem. In this paper, we introduce SAE Match, a novel, data-free method for aligning SAE features across different layers of a neural network. Our approach involves matching features by minimizing the mean squared error between the folded parameters of SAEs, a technique that incorporates activation thresholds into the encoder and decoder weights to account for differences in feature scales. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma 2 language model, we demonstrate that our method effectively captures feature evolution across layers, improving feature matching quality. We also show that features persist over several layers and that our approach can approximate hidden states across layers. Our work advances the understanding of feature dynamics in neural networks and provides a new tool for mechanistic interpretability studies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, keypoint detection or matching tends to fail in challenging scenarios with inconsistent illuminations or textureless objects, resulting significant performance degradation. Previous approaches, including our proposed Correspondence encoded Neural image Servo policy (CNS), attempted to alleviate these issues by integrating neural control strategies. While CNS shows certain improvement against error correspondence over conventional image-based controllers, it could not fully resolve the limitations arising from poor keypoint detection and matching. In this paper, we continue to address this problem and propose a new solution: Probabilistic Correspondence Encoded Neural Image Servo (CNSv2). CNSv2 leverages probabilistic feature matching to improve robustness in challenging scenarios. By redesigning the architecture to condition on multimodal feature matching, CNSv2 achieves high precision, improved robustness across diverse scenes and runs in real-time. We validate CNSv2 with simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of detector-based methods in visual servo tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods typically rely on feature matching (FM) with stored descriptors or use a single network to encode both points and lines. While FM-based methods perform well in large-scale environments, they become computationally expensive with a growing number of mapping points and lines. Conversely, approaches that learn to encode mapping features within a single network reduce memory footprint but are prone to overfitting, as they may capture unnecessary correlations between points and lines. We propose that these features should be learned independently, each with a distinct focus, to achieve optimal accuracy. To this end, we introduce a new architecture that learns to prioritize each feature independently before combining them for localization. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the 3D map point and line regression performance for camera re-localization.

Equirectangular projection (ERP) images, with their large fields of view, are particularly suited for dense matching techniques that aim to establish comprehensive correspondences across images. However, ERP images are subject to significant distortions, which we address by leveraging the spherical camera model and geodesic flow refinement in the dense matching method. To further mitigate these distortions, we propose spherical positional embeddings based on 3D Cartesian coordinates of the feature grid. Additionally, our method incorporates bidirectional transformations between spherical and Cartesian coordinate systems during refinement, utilizing a unit sphere to improve matching performance. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves notable performance enhancements, with improvements of +26.72 and +42.62 in AUC@5{\deg} on the Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

CFTrack dynamically assesses target similarity during prediction through a novel contrastive feature matching module optimized with an adaptive contrastive loss, thereby improving tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on LaSOT, OTB100, and UAV123 show that CFTrack surpasses many state-of-the-art lightweight trackers, operating at 136 frames per second on the NVIDIA Jetson NX platform.

However, the input text description alone provides limited control over the precise objects movements and camera framing. In this work, we tackle the motion customization problem, where a reference video is provided as motion guidance. While most existing methods choose to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct the frame differences of the reference video, we observe that such strategy suffer from content leakage from the reference video, and they cannot capture complex motion accurately. To address this issue, we propose MotionMatcher, a motion customization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained T2V diffusion model at the feature level. Instead of using pixel-level objectives, MotionMatcher compares high-level, spatio-temporal motion features to fine-tune diffusion models, ensuring precise motion learning. For the sake of memory efficiency and accessibility, we utilize a pre-trained T2V diffusion model, which contains considerable prior knowledge about video motion, to compute these motion features. In our experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art motion customization performances, validating the design of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b09902097/motionmatcher/</p></details> | None |

Our approach begins by constructing a universal image feature dictionary using a multi-stage approach involving modified spatial pyramid pooling, dimension reduction, and multi-scale feature clustering. For each input image, we learn to synthesize a conditioning latent by selecting and synthesizing relevant features from the dictionary, which significantly enhances the model's capability in capturing and exploring image source correlation. This conditional latent synthesis involves a correlation-based feature matching and alignment strategy, comprising a Conditional Latent Matching (CLM) module and a Conditional Latent Synthesis (CLS) module. The synthesized latent is then used to guide the encoding process, allowing for more efficient compression by exploiting the correlation between the input image and the reference dictionary. According to our theoretical analysis, the proposed conditional latent coding (CLC) method is robust to perturbations in the external dictionary samples and the selected conditioning latent, with an error bound that scales logarithmically with the dictionary size, ensuring stability even with large and diverse dictionaries. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our new method improves the coding performance by a large margin (up to 1.2 dB) with a very small overhead of approximately 0.5\% bits per pixel.

The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances.

Despite recent progress in data-driven models, feature correspondence learning is still limited by the lack of accurate per-pixel correspondence labels. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new self-supervised scheme, imperative learning (IL), for training feature correspondence. It enables correspondence learning on arbitrary uninterrupted videos without any camera pose or depth labels, heralding a new era for self-supervised correspondence learning. Specifically, we formulated the problem of correspondence learning as a bilevel optimization, which takes the reprojection error from bundle adjustment as a supervisory signal for the model. To avoid large memory and computation overhead, we leverage the stationary point to effectively back-propagate the implicit gradients through bundle adjustment. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance on tasks including feature matching and pose estimation, in which we obtained an average of 30% accuracy gain over the state-of-the-art matching models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint corresponds to the Accepted Manuscript in European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024</p></details> | None |

However, their development is hindered by a lack of suitable datasets with 3D ground truth. This work explores an approach to generating realistic and accurate ex vivo datasets tailored for 3D reconstruction and feature matching in open orthopedic surgery. A set of posed images and an accurately registered ground truth surface mesh of the scene are required to develop vision-based 3D reconstruction and matching methods suitable for surgery. We propose a framework consisting of three core steps and compare different methods for each step: 3D scanning, calibration of viewpoints for a set of high-resolution RGB images, and an optical-based method for scene registration. We evaluate each step of this framework on an ex vivo scoliosis surgery using a pig spine, conducted under real operating room conditions. A mean 3D Euclidean error of 0.35 mm is achieved with respect to the 3D ground truth. The proposed method results in submillimeter accurate 3D ground truths and surgical images with a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm.

| **[Rethinking and Accelerating Graph Condensation: A Training-Free Approach with Class Partition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13707v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs poses a significant challenge for graph neural network training, attributed to their substantial computational requirements. In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a promising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a small yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization processes, necessitating excessive computing resources and training time. In this paper, we revisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two pervasive issues therein: (1) various GC optimization strategies converge to coarse-grained class-level node feature matching between the original and condensed graphs; (2) existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph network architecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with iterative gradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a training-free GC framework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC), which refines the node distribution matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a novel class-to-node paradigm, transforming the GC optimization into a class partition problem which can be efficiently solved by any clustering methods. Moreover, CGC incorporates a pre-defined graph structure to enable a closed-form solution for condensed node features, eliminating the need for back-and-forth gradient descent in existing GC approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC achieves an exceedingly efficient condensation process with advanced accuracy. Compared with the state-of-the-art GC methods, CGC condenses the Ogbn-products graph within 30 seconds, achieving a speedup ranging from $10^2$X to $10^4$X and increasing accuracy by up to 4.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25)</p></details> | None |
| **[Out of Length Text Recognition with Sub-String Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12317v3)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene Text Recognition (STR) methods have demonstrated robust performance in word-level text recognition. However, in real applications the text image is sometimes long due to detected with multiple horizontal words. It triggers the requirement to build long text recognition models from readily available short (i.e., word-level) text datasets, which has been less studied previously. In this paper, we term this task Out of Length (OOL) text recognition. We establish the first Long Text Benchmark (LTB) to facilitate the assessment of different methods in long text recognition. Meanwhile, we propose a novel method called OOL Text Recognition with sub-String Matching (SMTR). SMTR comprises two cross-attention-based modules: one encodes a sub-string containing multiple characters into next and previous queries, and the other employs the queries to attend to the image features, matching the sub-string and simultaneously recognizing its next and previous character. SMTR can recognize text of arbitrary length by iterating the process above. To avoid being trapped in recognizing highly similar sub-strings, we introduce a regularization training to compel SMTR to effectively discover subtle differences between similar sub-strings for precise matching. In addition, we propose an inference augmentation strategy to alleviate confusion caused by identical sub-strings in the same text and improve the overall recognition efficiency. Extensive experimental results reveal that SMTR, even when trained exclusively on short text, outperforms existing methods in public short text benchmarks and exhibits a clear advantage on LTB.

| **[Vector-Symbolic Architecture for Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08300v3)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From a perspective of feature matching, optical flow estimation for event cameras involves identifying event correspondences by comparing feature similarity across accompanying event frames. In this work, we introduces an effective and robust high-dimensional (HD) feature descriptor for event frames, utilizing Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). The topological similarity among neighboring variables within VSA contributes to the enhanced representation similarity of feature descriptors for flow-matching points, while its structured symbolic representation capacity facilitates feature fusion from both event polarities and multiple spatial scales. Based on this HD feature descriptor, we propose a novel feature matching framework for event-based optical flow, encompassing both model-based (VSA-Flow) and self-supervised learning (VSA-SM) methods. In VSA-Flow, accurate optical flow estimation validates the effectiveness of HD feature descriptors. In VSA-SM, a novel similarity maximization method based on the HD feature descriptor is proposed to learn optical flow in a self-supervised way from events alone, eliminating the need for auxiliary grayscale images. Evaluation results demonstrate that our VSA-based method achieves superior accuracy in comparison to both model-based and self-supervised learning methods on the DSEC benchmark, while remains competitive among both methods on the MVSEC benchmark. This contribution marks a significant advancement in event-based optical flow within the feature matching methodology.</p></details> |  | None |

Among these, sparse feature matching stands out as an efficient, versatile, and generally lightweight approach with numerous applications. However, feature-based methods often struggle with significant viewpoint and appearance changes, leading to matching failures and inaccurate pose estimates. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages a globally sparse yet locally dense 3D representation of 2D features. By tracking and triangulating landmarks over a sequence of frames, we construct a sparse voxel map optimized to render image patch descriptors observed during tracking. Given an initial pose estimate, we first synthesize descriptors from the voxels using volumetric rendering and then perform feature matching to estimate the camera pose. This methodology enables the generation of descriptors for unseen views, enhancing robustness to view changes. We extensively evaluate our method on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art feature representation techniques in indoor environments, achieving up to a 39% improvement in median translation error. Additionally, our approach yields comparable results to other methods for outdoor scenarios while maintaining lower memory and computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Tucson, Arizona, US, Feb 28-Mar 4, 2025</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements have given rise to purely CNN-based and transformer-based approaches, each augmented with deep learning techniques. While CNN-based methods often excel in matching speed, transformer-based methods tend to provide more accurate matches. We propose an efficient transformer-based network architecture for local feature matching. This technique is built on constructing multiple homography hypotheses to approximate the continuous correspondence in the real world and uni-directional cross-attention to accelerate the refinement. On the YFCC100M dataset, our matching accuracy is competitive with LoFTR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture, while the inference speed is boosted to 4 times, even outperforming the CNN-based methods. Comprehensive evaluations on other open datasets such as Megadepth, ScanNet, and HPatches demonstrate our method's efficacy, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance a wide array of downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

We tackle this by adopting Mahalanobis k-NN's inherent property to capture the distribution of the local neighborhood and surficial geometry. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any local-graph-based point cloud analysis method. In this paper, we focus on two distinct methodologies: Deep Closest Point (DCP) and Deep Universal Manifold Embedding (DeepUME). Our extensive benchmarking on the ModelNet40 and FAUST datasets highlights the efficacy of the proposed method in point cloud registration tasks. Moreover, we establish for the first time that the features acquired through point cloud registration inherently can possess discriminative capabilities. This is evident by a substantial improvement of about 20% in the average accuracy observed in the point cloud few-shot classification task, benchmarked on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generic Objects as Pose Probes for Few-shot View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16690v3)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance fields including NeRFs and 3D Gaussians demonstrate great potential in high-fidelity rendering and scene reconstruction, while they require a substantial number of posed images as inputs. COLMAP is frequently employed for preprocessing to estimate poses, while it necessitates a large number of feature matches to operate effectively, and it struggles with scenes characterized by sparse features, large baselines between images, or a limited number of input images. We aim to tackle few-view NeRF reconstruction using only 3 to 6 unposed scene images. Traditional methods often use calibration boards but they are not common in images. We propose a novel idea of utilizing everyday objects, commonly found in both images and real life, as "pose probes". The probe object is automatically segmented by SAM, whose shape is initialized from a cube. We apply a dual-branch volume rendering optimization (object NeRF and scene NeRF) to constrain the pose optimization and jointly refine the geometry. Specifically, object poses of two views are first estimated by PnP matching in an SDF representation, which serves as initial poses. PnP matching, requiring only a few features, is suitable for feature-sparse scenes. Additional views are incrementally incorporated to refine poses from preceding views. In experiments, PoseProbe achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis across multiple datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in few-view and large-baseline scenes where COLMAP struggles. In ablations, using different objects in a scene yields comparable performance.

Generative Replay (GR)-based CL systems utilize a generative model to produce synthetic versions of past data, which are then combined with new data to retrain the primary model. Traditional machine learning techniques in this domain often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, where a model's performance on old data degrades over time. In this paper, we introduce a GR-based CL system that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with feature matching loss to generate high-quality malware samples. Additionally, we implement innovative selection schemes for replay samples based on the model's hidden representations. Our comprehensive evaluation across Windows and Android malware datasets in a class-incremental learning scenario -- where new classes are introduced continuously over multiple tasks -- demonstrates substantial performance improvements over previous methods. For example, our system achieves an average accuracy of 55% on Windows malware samples, significantly outperforming other GR-based models by 28%. This study provides practical insights for advancing GR-based malware classification systems.

A unified perspective for this task is to treat it as a searching problem, aiming at an efficient search strategy to narrow the search space to point matches between images. One of the key aspects of search strategy is the search space, which in current approaches is not carefully defined, resulting in limited matching accuracy. This paper, thus, pays attention to the search space and proposes to set the initial search space for point matching as the matched image areas containing prominent semantic, named semantic area matches. This search space favors point matching by salient features and alleviates the accuracy limitation in recent Transformer-based matching methods. To achieve this search space, we introduce a hierarchical feature matching framework: Area to Point Matching (A2PM), to first find semantic area matches between images and later perform point matching on area matches. We further propose Semantic and Geometry Area Matching (SGAM) method to realize this framework, which utilizes semantic prior and geometry consistency to establish accurate area matches between images. By integrating SGAM with off-the-shelf state-of-the-art matchers, our method, adopting the A2PM framework, achieves encouraging precision improvements in massive point matching and pose estimation experiments.</p></details> | v3 | None |

Different from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method introduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the intermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the student model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context modeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task loss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention alignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level information transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were comprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language processing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close to the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline models such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance improvements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that the feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression method that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage requirements while maintaining model capabilities. Future research can be further expanded in the directions of self-supervised learning, cross-modal feature alignment, and multi-task transfer learning to provide more flexible and efficient solutions for the deployment and optimization of deep learning models.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |

We propose a density-robust feature extraction and matching scheme to achieve robust and accurate cross-source registration. To address the density inconsistency between cross-source data, we introduce a density-robust encoder for extracting density-robust features. To tackle the issue of challenging feature matching and few correct correspondences, we adopt a loose-to-strict matching pipeline with a ``loose generation, strict selection'' idea. Under it, we employ a one-to-many strategy to loosely generate initial correspondences. Subsequently, high-quality correspondences are strictly selected to achieve robust registration through sparse matching and dense matching. On the challenging Kinect-LiDAR scene in the cross-source 3DCSR dataset, our method improves feature matching recall by 63.5 percentage points (pp) and registration recall by 57.6 pp. It also achieves the best performance on 3DMatch, while maintaining robustness under diverse downsampling densities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Our method addresses the challenges of visually similar birds and their rapid movements by leveraging environmental landmarks for enhanced feature matching and 3D reconstruction. In our approach, outliers are rejected based on their nearest landmark. This enables precise 3D-modeling and simultaneous tracking of multiple birds. By utilizing environmental context, our approach significantly improves the differentiation between visually similar birds, a key obstacle in existing tracking systems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing a $20\%$ elimination of outliers in the 3D reconstruction process, with a $97\%$ accuracy in matching. This remarkable accuracy in 3D modeling translates to robust and reliable tracking of multiple birds, even in challenging outdoor conditions. Our work not only advances the field of computer vision but also provides a valuable tool for studying bird behavior and movement patterns in natural settings. We also provide a large annotated dataset of 80 birds residing in four enclosures for 20 hours of footage which provides a rich testbed for researchers in computer vision, ornithologists, and ecologists.

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BSAFusion: A Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment Network for Unaligned Medical Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08050v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If unaligned multimodal medical images can be simultaneously aligned and fused using a single-stage approach within a unified processing framework, it will not only achieve mutual promotion of dual tasks but also help reduce the complexity of the model. However, the design of this model faces the challenge of incompatible requirements for feature fusion and alignment; specifically, feature alignment requires consistency among corresponding features, whereas feature fusion requires the features to be complementary to each other. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an unaligned medical image fusion method called Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment and Fusion (BSFA-F) strategy. To reduce the negative impact of modality differences on cross-modal feature matching, we incorporate the Modal Discrepancy-Free Feature Representation (MDF-FR) method into BSFA-F. MDF-FR utilizes a Modality Feature Representation Head (MFRH) to integrate the global information of the input image. By injecting the information contained in MFRH of the current image into other modality images, it effectively reduces the impact of modality differences on feature alignment while preserving the complementary information carried by different images. In terms of feature alignment, BSFA-F employs a bidirectional stepwise alignment deformation field prediction strategy based on the path independence of vector displacement between two points. This strategy solves the problem of large spans and inaccurate deformation field prediction in single-step alignment. Finally, Multi-Modal Feature Fusion block achieves the fusion of aligned features. The experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing SOP methods typically aggregate contextual features to assist the occupancy representation learning, alleviating issues like occlusion or ambiguity. However, these solutions often face misalignment issues wherein the corresponding features at the same position across different frames may have different semantic meanings during the aggregation process, which leads to unreliable contextual fusion results and an unstable representation learning process. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hierarchical context alignment paradigm for a more accurate SOP (Hi-SOP). Hi-SOP first disentangles the geometric and temporal context for separate alignment, which two branches are then composed to enhance the reliability of SOP. This parsing of the visual input into a local-global alignment hierarchy includes: (I) disentangled geometric and temporal separate alignment, within each leverages depth confidence and camera pose as prior for relevant feature matching respectively; (II) global alignment and composition of the transformed geometric and temporal volumes based on semantics consistency. Our method outperforms SOTAs for semantic scene completion on the SemanticKITTI & NuScenes-Occupancy datasets and LiDAR semantic segmentation on the NuScenes dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent continual learning approaches often leverage the vision-language model CLIP for its high-dimensional feature space and cross-modality feature matching. Traditional CLIP-based classification methods identify the most similar text label for a test image by comparing their embeddings. However, these methods are sensitive to the quality of text phrases and less effective for classes lacking meaningful text labels. In this work, we rethink CLIP-based continual learning and introduce the concept of Label Vector Pool (LVP). LVP replaces text labels with training images as similarity references, eliminating the need for ideal text descriptions. We present three variations of LVP and evaluate their performance on class and domain incremental learning tasks. Leveraging CLIP's high dimensional feature space, LVP learning algorithms are task-order invariant. The new knowledge does not modify the old knowledge, hence, there is minimum forgetting. Different tasks can be learned independently and in parallel with low computational and memory demands. Experimental results show that proposed LVP-based methods outperform the current state-of-the-art baseline by a significant margin of 40.7%.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to CVPR2025</p></details> | None |

This leads to many-to-one matches and numerous potential inliers without any corresponding point. Recently, some approaches have framed the feature matching task as an assignment problem to achieve optimal one-to-one matches. We argue that the transition to the Assignment problem is not reliable for general correspondence-based PCR. In this paper, we propose a heuristics stable matching policy called GS-matching, inspired by the Gale-Shapley algorithm. Compared to the other matching policies, our method can perform efficiently and find more non-repetitive inliers under low overlapping conditions. Furthermore, we employ the probability theory to analyze the feature matching task, providing new insights into this research problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our matching policy, achieving better registration recall on multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, aligning these policies with end-user preferences remains a challenge, particularly when the preferences are hard to specify. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant mechanism for alignment in non-embodied domains like large language models, it has not seen the same success in aligning visuomotor policies due to the prohibitive amount of human feedback required to learn visual reward functions. To address this limitation, we propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), an observation-only method for learning visual rewards from significantly less human preference feedback. Unlike traditional RLHF, RAPL focuses human feedback on fine-tuning pre-trained vision encoders to align with the end-user's visual representation and then constructs a dense visual reward via feature matching in this aligned representation space. We first validate RAPL through simulation experiments in the X-Magical benchmark and Franka Panda robotic manipulation, demonstrating that it can learn rewards aligned with human preferences, more efficiently uses preference data, and generalizes across robot embodiments. Finally, our hardware experiments align pre-trained Diffusion Policies for three object manipulation tasks. We find that RAPL can fine-tune these policies with 5x less real human preference data, taking the first step towards minimizing human feedback while maximizing visuomotor robot policy alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJRR, this paper is an extended journal version of the conference paper arXiv:2310.07932 with new results and discussion. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.07932</p></details> | None |

Existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods often fall short in sparse view settings and during large camera movements due to their reliance on gradient descent-based optimization, which is both slow and inaccurate. FlashSLAM addresses these limitations by combining 3DGS with a fast vision-based camera tracking technique, utilizing a pretrained feature matching model and point cloud registration for precise pose estimation in under 80 ms - a 90% reduction in tracking time compared to SplaTAM - without costly iterative rendering. In sparse settings, our method achieves up to a 92% improvement in average tracking accuracy over previous methods. Additionally, it accounts for noise in depth sensors, enhancing robustness when using unspecialized devices such as smartphones. Extensive experiments show that FlashSLAM performs reliably across both sparse and dense settings, in synthetic and real-world environments. Evaluations on benchmark datasets highlight its superior accuracy and efficiency, establishing FlashSLAM as a versatile and high-performance solution for SLAM, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D reconstruction across diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

Traditional screening methods for the scoliosis usually use radiographic examination, which requires certified experts with medical instruments and brings the radiation risk. Considering such requirement and inconvenience, we propose to use natural images of the human back for wide-range scoliosis screening, which is a challenging problem. In this paper, we notice that the human back has a certain degree of symmetry, and asymmetrical human backs are usually caused by spinal lesions. Besides, scoliosis severity levels have ordinal relationships. Taking inspiration from this, we propose a dual-path scoliosis detection network with two main modules: symmetric feature matching module (SFMM) and ordinal regression head (ORH). Specifically, we first adopt a backbone to extract features from both the input image and its horizontally flipped image. Then, we feed the two extracted features into the SFMM to capture symmetric relationships. Finally, we use the ORH to transform the ordinal regression problem into a series of binary classification sub-problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods as well as human performance, which provides a promising and economic solution to wide-range scoliosis screening. In particular, our method achieves accuracies of 95.11% and 81.46% in estimation of general severity level and fine-grained severity level of the scoliosis, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Applied Intelligence</p></details> | None |

Our model maintains a global point cloud representation of the scene, continuously updating the features and 3D locations of points as new images are observed. It expands the point cloud with newly detected points while carefully removing redundancies. The point cloud updates and the depth predictions for new points are achieved through a novel ray-based 2D-3D feature matching technique, which is robust against errors in previous point position predictions. In contrast to offline methods, our approach processes infinite-length sequences and provides real-time updates. Additionally, the point cloud imposes no pre-defined resolution or scene size constraints, and its unified global representation ensures view consistency across perspectives.

| **[When to Extract ReID Features: A Selective Approach for Improved Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06617v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting and matching Re-Identification (ReID) features is used by many state-of-the-art (SOTA) Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) methods, particularly effective against frequent and long-term occlusions. While end-to-end object detection and tracking have been the main focus of recent research, they have yet to outperform traditional methods in benchmarks like MOT17 and MOT20. Thus, from an application standpoint, methods with separate detection and embedding remain the best option for accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation, though they are impractical for edge devices due to the overhead involved. In this paper, we investigate a selective approach to minimize the overhead of feature extraction while preserving accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation. This approach can be integrated into various SOTA methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to StrongSORT and Deep OC-SORT. Experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets show that our mechanism retains the advantages of feature extraction during occlusions while significantly reducing runtime. Additionally, it improves accuracy by preventing confusion in the feature-matching stage, particularly in cases of deformation and appearance similarity, which are common in DanceTrack. https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-StrongSORT, https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-Deep-OC-SORT</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DIS-Mine: Instance Segmentation for Disaster-Awareness in Poor-Light Condition in Underground Mines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13544v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting disasters in underground mining, such as explosions and structural damage, has been a persistent challenge over the years. This problem is compounded for first responders, who often have no clear information about the extent or nature of the damage within the mine. The poor-light or even total darkness inside the mines makes rescue efforts incredibly difficult, leading to a tragic loss of life. In this paper, we propose a novel instance segmentation method called DIS-Mine, specifically designed to identify disaster-affected areas within underground mines under low-light or poor visibility conditions, aiding first responders in rescue efforts. DIS-Mine is capable of detecting objects in images, even in complete darkness, by addressing challenges such as high noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast. The key innovations of DIS-Mine are built upon four core components: i) Image brightness improvement, ii) Instance segmentation with SAM integration, iii) Mask R-CNN-based segmentation, and iv) Mask alignment with feature matching. On top of that, we have collected real-world images from an experimental underground mine, introducing a new dataset named ImageMine, specifically gathered in low-visibility conditions. This dataset serves to validate the performance of DIS-Mine in realistic, challenging environments. Our comprehensive experiments on the ImageMine dataset, as well as on various other datasets demonstrate that DIS-Mine achieves a superior F1 score of 86.0% and mIoU of 72.0%, outperforming state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, with at least 15x improvement and up to 80% higher precision in object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Counterfactual Learning-Driven Representation Disentanglement for Search-Enhanced Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18631v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For recommender systems in internet platforms, search activities provide additional insights into user interest through query-click interactions with items, and are thus widely used for enhancing personalized recommendation. However, these interacted items not only have transferable features matching users' interest helpful for the recommendation domain, but also have features related to users' unique intents in the search domain. Such domain gap of item features is neglected by most current search-enhanced recommendation methods. They directly incorporate these search behaviors into recommendation, and thus introduce partial negative transfer. To address this, we propose a Counterfactual learning-driven representation disentanglement framework for search-enhanced recommendation, based on the common belief that a user would click an item under a query not solely because of the item-query match but also due to the item's query-independent general features (e.g., color or style) that interest the user. These general features exclude the reflection of search-specific intents contained in queries, ensuring a pure match to users' underlying interest to complement recommendation. According to counterfactual thinking, how would user preferences and query match change for items if we removed their query-related features in search, we leverage search queries to construct counterfactual signals to disentangle item representations, isolating only query-independent general features. These representations subsequently enable feature augmentation and data augmentation for the recommendation scenario. Comprehensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate ClardRec is effective in both collaborative filtering and sequential recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the divergence in modalities and views, image-to-OSM (I2O) matching and localization remain challenging for robots, preventing the full utilization of VGI data in the unmanned ground vehicles and logistic industry. Inspired by the fact that the human brain relies on geometric and semantic understanding of sensory information for spatial localization tasks, we propose the OSMLoc in this paper. OSMLoc is a brain-inspired single-image visual localization method with semantic and geometric guidance to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational model to extract powerful image features. Second, a geometry-guided depth distribution adapter is proposed to bridge the monocular depth estimation and camera-to-BEV transform. Thirdly, the semantic embeddings from the OSM data are utilized as auxiliary guidance for image-to-OSM feature matching. To validate the proposed OSMLoc, we collect a worldwide cross-area and cross-condition (CC) benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments on the MGL dataset, CC validation benchmark, and KITTI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

There has been growing interest in object and scene-based localisation using NeRFs, with a number of recent works relying on sampling-based or Monte-Carlo localisation schemes. Unfortunately, these can be extremely computationally expensive, requiring multiple network forward passes to infer camera or object pose. To alleviate this, a variety of sampling strategies have been applied, many relying on keypoint recognition techniques from classical computer vision. This work conducts a systematic empirical comparison of these approaches and shows that in contrast to conventional feature matching approaches for geometry-based localisation, sampling-based localisation using NeRFs benefits significantly from stable features. Results show that rendering stable features provides significantly better estimation with a tenfold reduction in the number of forward passes required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[XPoint: A Self-Supervised Visual-State-Space based Architecture for Multispectral Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07430v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multispectral image matching presents significant challenges due to non-linear intensity variations across spectral modalities, extreme viewpoint changes, and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Current state-of-the-art methods are typically specialized for a single spectral difference, such as visibleinfrared, and struggle to adapt to other modalities due to their reliance on expensive supervision, such as depth maps or camera poses. To address the need for rapid adaptation across modalities, we introduce XPoint, a self-supervised, modular image-matching framework designed for adaptive training and fine-tuning on aligned multispectral datasets, allowing users to customize key components based on their specific tasks. XPoint employs modularity and self-supervision to allow for the adjustment of elements such as the base detector, which generates pseudoground truth keypoints invariant to viewpoint and spectrum variations. The framework integrates a VMamba encoder, pretrained on segmentation tasks, for robust feature extraction, and includes three joint decoder heads: two are dedicated to interest point and descriptor extraction; and a task-specific homography regression head imposes geometric constraints for superior performance in tasks like image registration. This flexible architecture enables quick adaptation to a wide range of modalities, demonstrated by training on Optical-Thermal data and fine-tuning on settings such as visual-near infrared, visual-infrared, visual-longwave infrared, and visual-synthetic aperture radar. Experimental results show that XPoint consistently outperforms or matches state-ofthe-art methods in feature matching and image registration tasks across five distinct multispectral datasets.

| **[Non-Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Successor Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07007v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), an agent seeks to replicate expert demonstrations through interactions with the environment. Traditionally, IRL is treated as an adversarial game, where an adversary searches over reward models, and a learner optimizes the reward through repeated RL procedures. This game-solving approach is both computationally expensive and difficult to stabilize. In this work, we propose a novel approach to IRL by direct policy optimization: exploiting a linear factorization of the return as the inner product of successor features and a reward vector, we design an IRL algorithm by policy gradient descent on the gap between the learner and expert features. Our non-adversarial method does not require learning a reward function and can be solved seamlessly with existing actor-critic RL algorithms. Remarkably, our approach works in state-only settings without expert action labels, a setting which behavior cloning (BC) cannot solve. Empirical results demonstrate that our method learns from as few as a single expert demonstration and achieves improved performance on various control tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HomoMatcher: Dense Feature Matching Results with Semi-Dense Efficiency by Homography Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06700v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching between image pairs is a fundamental problem in computer vision that drives many applications, such as SLAM. Recently, semi-dense matching approaches have achieved substantial performance enhancements and established a widely-accepted coarse-to-fine paradigm. However, the majority of existing methods focus on improving coarse feature representation rather than the fine-matching module. Prior fine-matching techniques, which rely on point-to-patch matching probability expectation or direct regression, often lack precision and do not guarantee the continuity of feature points across sequential images. To address this limitation, this paper concentrates on enhancing the fine-matching module in the semi-dense matching framework. We employ a lightweight and efficient homography estimation network to generate the perspective mapping between patches obtained from coarse matching. This patch-to-patch approach achieves the overall alignment of two patches, resulting in a higher sub-pixel accuracy by incorporating additional constraints. By leveraging the homography estimation between patches, we can achieve a dense matching result with low computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy compared to previous semi-dense matchers. Meanwhile, our dense matching results exhibit similar end-point-error accuracy compared to previous dense matchers while maintaining semi-dense efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, conference under review</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Sparse Allocation with Mutual Choice & Feature Choice Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02124v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach to extracting features from neural networks, enabling model interpretability as well as causal interventions on model internals. SAEs generate sparse feature representations using a sparsifying activation function that implicitly defines a set of token-feature matches. We frame the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem constrained by a total sparsity upper bound. For example, TopK SAEs solve this allocation problem with the additional constraint that each token matches with at most $k$ features. In TopK SAEs, the $k$ active features per token constraint is the same across tokens, despite some tokens being more difficult to reconstruct than others. To address this limitation, we propose two novel SAE variants, Feature Choice SAEs and Mutual Choice SAEs, which each allow for a variable number of active features per token. Feature Choice SAEs solve the sparsity allocation problem under the additional constraint that each feature matches with at most $m$ tokens. Mutual Choice SAEs solve the unrestricted allocation problem where the total sparsity budget can be allocated freely between tokens and features. Additionally, we introduce a new auxiliary loss function, $\mathtt{aux\_zipf\_loss}$, which generalises the $\mathtt{aux\_k\_loss}$ to mitigate dead and underutilised features. Our methods result in SAEs with fewer dead features and improved reconstruction loss at equivalent sparsity levels as a result of the inherent adaptive computation. More accurate and scalable feature extraction methods provide a path towards better understanding and more precise control of foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (18 w/ appendices), 7 figures.

This article introduces decisive disparity diffusion (D3Stereo), marking the first exploration of dense deep feature matching that adapts pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to previously unseen road scenarios. A pyramid of cost volumes is initially created using various levels of learned representations. Subsequently, a novel recursive bilateral filtering algorithm is employed to aggregate these costs. A key innovation of D3Stereo lies in its alternating decisive disparity diffusion strategy, wherein intra-scale diffusion is employed to complete sparse disparity images, while inter-scale inheritance provides valuable prior information for higher resolutions. Extensive experiments conducted on our created UDTIRI-Stereo and Stereo-Road datasets underscore the effectiveness of D3Stereo strategy in adapting pre-trained DCNNs and its superior performance compared to all other explicit programming-based algorithms designed specifically for road surface 3D reconstruction. Additional experiments conducted on the Middlebury dataset with backbone DCNNs pre-trained on the ImageNet database further validate the versatility of D3Stereo strategy in tackling general stereo matching problems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Adaptive Stereo Depth Estimation with Multi-Spectral Images Across All Lighting Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03638v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation under adverse conditions remains a significant challenge. Recently, multi-spectral depth estimation, which integrates both visible light and thermal images, has shown promise in addressing this issue. However, existing algorithms struggle with precise pixel-level feature matching, limiting their ability to fully exploit geometric constraints across different spectra. To address this, we propose a novel framework incorporating stereo depth estimation to enforce accurate geometric constraints. In particular, we treat the visible light and thermal images as a stereo pair and utilize a Cross-modal Feature Matching (CFM) Module to construct a cost volume for pixel-level matching. To mitigate the effects of poor lighting on stereo matching, we introduce Degradation Masking, which leverages robust monocular thermal depth estimation in degraded regions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS2) dataset, with qualitative evaluations demonstrating high-quality depth maps under varying lighting conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic-Aligned Adversarial Evolution Triangle for High-Transferability Vision-Language Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02669v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models excel at interpreting both images and text but remain vulnerable to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs). Advancing the generation of transferable AEs, which succeed across unseen models, is key to developing more robust and practical VLP models. Previous approaches augment image-text pairs to enhance diversity within the adversarial example generation process, aiming to improve transferability by expanding the contrast space of image-text features. However, these methods focus solely on diversity around the current AEs, yielding limited gains in transferability. To address this issue, we propose to increase the diversity of AEs by leveraging the intersection regions along the adversarial trajectory during optimization. Specifically, we propose sampling from adversarial evolution triangles composed of clean, historical, and current adversarial examples to enhance adversarial diversity. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial evolution triangle. Moreover, we find that redundant inactive dimensions can dominate similarity calculations, distorting feature matching and making AEs model-dependent with reduced transferability. Hence, we propose to generate AEs in the semantic image-text feature contrast space, which can project the original feature space into a semantic corpus subspace. The proposed semantic-aligned subspace can reduce the image feature redundancy, thereby improving adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments across different datasets and models demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve adversarial transferability and outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods.

| **[Semantic Masking and Visual Feature Matching for Robust Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01804v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are interested in long-term deployments of autonomous robots to aid astronauts with maintenance and monitoring operations in settings such as the International Space Station. Unfortunately, such environments tend to be highly dynamic and unstructured, and their frequent reconfiguration poses a challenge for robust long-term localization of robots. Many state-of-the-art visual feature-based localization algorithms are not robust towards spatial scene changes, and SLAM algorithms, while promising, cannot run within the low-compute budget available to space robots. To address this gap, we present a computationally efficient semantic masking approach for visual feature matching that improves the accuracy and robustness of visual localization systems during long-term deployment in changing environments. Our method introduces a lightweight check that enforces matches to be within long-term static objects and have consistent semantic classes. We evaluate this approach using both map-based relocalization and relative pose estimation and show that it improves Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) and correct match ratios on the publicly available Astrobee dataset. While this approach was originally developed for microgravity robotic freeflyers, it can be applied to any visual feature matching pipeline to improve robustness.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods rely heavily on epipolar priors, which can be unreliable in complex realworld scenes, particularly in non-overlapping and occluded regions. In this paper, we propose eFreeSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3DGS-based model for generalizable novel view synthesis that operates independently of epipolar line constraints. To enhance multiview feature extraction with 3D perception, we employ a selfsupervised Vision Transformer (ViT) with cross-view completion pre-training on large-scale datasets. Additionally, we introduce an Iterative Cross-view Gaussians Alignment method to ensure consistent depth scales across different views. Our eFreeSplat represents an innovative approach for generalizable novel view synthesis. Different from the existing pure geometry-free methods, eFreeSplat focuses more on achieving epipolar-free feature matching and encoding by providing 3D priors through cross-view pretraining. We evaluate eFreeSplat on wide-baseline novel view synthesis tasks using the RealEstate10K and ACID datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that eFreeSplat surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that rely on epipolar priors, achieving superior geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis quality.

| **[On Unsupervised Partial Shape Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14692v3)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While dealing with matching shapes to their parts, we often apply a tool known as functional maps. The idea is to translate the shape matching problem into "convenient" spaces by which matching is performed algebraically by solving a least squares problem. Here, we argue that such formulations, though popular in this field, introduce errors in the estimated match when partiality is invoked. Such errors are unavoidable even for advanced feature extraction networks, and they can be shown to escalate with increasing degrees of shape partiality, adversely affecting the learning capability of such systems. To circumvent these limitations, we propose a novel approach for partial shape matching. Our study of functional maps led us to a novel method that establishes direct correspondence between partial and full shapes through feature matching bypassing the need for functional map intermediate spaces. The Gromov Distance between metric spaces leads to the construction of the first part of our loss functions. For regularization we use two options: a term based on the area preserving property of the mapping, and a relaxed version that avoids the need to resort to functional maps. The proposed approach shows superior performance on the SHREC'16 dataset, outperforming existing unsupervised methods for partial shape matching.Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the SHREC'16 HOLES benchmark, superior also compared to supervised methods. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed unsupervised method when applied to a new dataset PFAUST for part-to-full shape correspondence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version, accepted for publication at the Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2024</p></details> | None |

However, existing Transformer-based detector-free local feature matching methods encounter challenges due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms, especially at high resolutions. However, while existing Transformer-based detector-free local feature matching methods have reduced computational costs using linear attention mechanisms, they still struggle to capture detailed local interactions, which affects the accuracy and robustness of precise local correspondences. In order to enhance representations of attention mechanisms while preserving low computational complexity, we propose the LoFLAT, a novel Local Feature matching using Focused Linear Attention Transformer in this paper. Our LoFLAT consists of three main modules: the Feature Extraction Module, the Feature Transformer Module, and the Matching Module. Specifically, the Feature Extraction Module firstly uses ResNet and a Feature Pyramid Network to extract hierarchical features. The Feature Transformer Module further employs the Focused Linear Attention to refine attention distribution with a focused mapping function and to enhance feature diversity with a depth-wise convolution. Finally, the Matching Module predicts accurate and robust matches through a coarse-to-fine strategy. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed LoFLAT outperforms the LoFTR method in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose EI-Nexus, an unmediated and flexible framework that integrates two modality-specific keypoint extractors and a feature matcher. To achieve keypoint extraction across viewpoint and modality changes, we bring Local Feature Distillation (LFD), which transfers the viewpoint consistency from a well-learned image extractor to the event extractor, ensuring robust feature correspondence. Furthermore, with the help of Context Aggregation (CA), a remarkable enhancement is observed in feature matching. We further establish the first two inter-modality feature matching benchmarks, MVSEC-RPE and EC-RPE, to assess relative pose estimation on event-image data. Our approach outperforms traditional methods that rely on explicit modal transformation, offering more unmediated and adaptable feature extraction and matching, achieving better keypoint similarity and state-of-the-art results on the MVSEC-RPE and EC-RPE benchmarks.

In medical imaging, the aim is often to place a 2D image in a 3D volumetric observation to w. Current approaches for rigid single slice in volume registration are limited by requirements such as pose initialization, stacks of adjacent slices, or reliable anatomical landmarks. Here, we propose a self-supervised 2D/3D registration approach to match a single 2D slice to the corresponding 3D volume. The method works in data without anatomical priors such as images of tumors. It addresses the dimensionality disparity and establishes correspondences between 2D in-plane and 3D out-of-plane rotation-equivariant features by using group equivariant CNNs. These rotation-equivariant features are extracted from the 2D query slice and aligned with their 3D counterparts. Results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed slice-in-volume registration on the NSCLC-Radiomics CT and KIRBY21 MRI datasets, attaining an absolute median angle error of less than 2 degrees and a mean-matching feature accuracy of 89% at a tolerance of 3 pixels.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach addresses two key challenges: the requirement for an initial object mask in the first frame in FoundationPose and issues with tracking loss and automatic rotation for symmetric objects. The algorithm requires only a CAD model of the target object, with the user clicking on its location in the live feed during the initial setup. Once set, the algorithm automatically saves a reference image of the object and, in subsequent runs, employs LightGlue for feature matching between the object and the real-time scene, providing an initial prompt for detection. Tested on the YCB dataset and industrial components such as bleach cleanser and gears, the algorithm demonstrated reliable 6D detection and tracking. By integrating SAM2 and FoundationPose, we effectively mitigated common limitations such as the problem of tracking loss, ensuring continuous and accurate tracking under challenging conditions like occlusion or rapid movement.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a 3D motion perception method called ScaleFlow++ that is easy to generalize. With just a pair of RGB images, ScaleFlow++ can robustly estimate optical flow and motion-in-depth (MID). Most existing methods directly regress MID from two RGB frames or optical flow, resulting in inaccurate and unstable results. Our key insight is cross-scale matching, which extracts deep motion clues by matching objects in pairs of images at different scales. Unlike previous methods, ScaleFlow++ integrates optical flow and MID estimation into a unified architecture, estimating optical flow and MID end-to-end based on feature matching. Moreover, we also proposed modules such as global initialization network, global iterative optimizer, and hybrid training pipeline to integrate global motion information, reduce the number of iterations, and prevent overfitting during training. On KITTI, ScaleFlow++ achieved the best monocular scene flow estimation performance, reducing SF-all from 6.21 to 5.79. The evaluation of MID even surpasses RGBD-based methods. In addition, ScaleFlow++ has achieved stunning zero-shot generalization performance in both rigid and nonrigid scenes.

| **[Progressive Retinal Image Registration via Global and Local Deformable Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01068v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal image registration plays an important role in the ophthalmological diagnosis process. Since there exist variances in viewing angles and anatomical structures across different retinal images, keypoint-based approaches become the mainstream methods for retinal image registration thanks to their robustness and low latency. These methods typically assume the retinal surfaces are planar, and adopt feature matching to obtain the homography matrix that represents the global transformation between images. Yet, such a planar hypothesis inevitably introduces registration errors since retinal surface is approximately curved. This limitation is more prominent when registering image pairs with significant differences in viewing angles. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid registration framework called HybridRetina, which progressively registers retinal images with global and local deformable transformations. For that, we use a keypoint detector and a deformation network called GAMorph to estimate the global transformation and local deformable transformation, respectively. Specifically, we integrate multi-level pixel relation knowledge to guide the training of GAMorph. Additionally, we utilize an edge attention module that includes the geometric priors of the images, ensuring the deformation field focuses more on the vascular regions of clinical interest. Experiments on two widely-used datasets, FIRE and FLoRI21, show that our proposed HybridRetina significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

This paper presents LoGS, a vision-based localization pipeline utilizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) technique as scene representation. This novel representation allows high-quality novel view synthesis. During the mapping phase, structure-from-motion (SfM) is applied first, followed by the generation of a GS map. During localization, the initial position is obtained through image retrieval, local feature matching coupled with a PnP solver, and then a high-precision pose is achieved through the analysis-by-synthesis manner on the GS map. Experimental results on four large-scale datasets demonstrate the proposed approach's SoTA accuracy in estimating camera poses and robustness under challenging few-shot conditions.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Although coarse-to-fine matching approaches are prevalent, the coarse matching of existing methods is typically sparse and loose without consideration of geometric consistency, which makes the subsequent fine matching rely on ineffective optimal transport and hypothesis-and-selection methods for consistency. Therefore, these methods are neither efficient nor scalable for real-time applications such as odometry in robotics. To address these issues, we design a consistency-aware spot-guided Transformer (CAST), which incorporates a spot-guided cross-attention module to avoid interfering with irrelevant areas, and a consistency-aware self-attention module to enhance matching capabilities with geometrically consistent correspondences. Furthermore, a lightweight fine matching module for both sparse keypoints and dense features can estimate the transformation accurately. Extensive experiments on both outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets and indoor RGBD point cloud datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 as poster</p></details> | None |

The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks.

| **[Semantic-aware Representation Learning for Homography Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13284v4)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homography estimation is the task of determining the transformation from an image pair. Our approach focuses on employing detector-free feature matching methods to address this issue. Previous work has underscored the importance of incorporating semantic information, however there still lacks an efficient way to utilize semantic information. Previous methods suffer from treating the semantics as a pre-processing, causing the utilization of semantics overly coarse-grained and lack adaptability when dealing with different tasks. In our work, we seek another way to use the semantic information, that is semantic-aware feature representation learning framework.Based on this, we propose SRMatcher, a new detector-free feature matching method, which encourages the network to learn integrated semantic feature representation.Specifically, to capture precise and rich semantics, we leverage the capabilities of recently popularized vision foundation models (VFMs) trained on extensive datasets. Then, a cross-images Semantic-aware Fusion Block (SFB) is proposed to integrate its fine-grained semantic features into the feature representation space. In this way, by reducing errors stemming from semantic inconsistencies in matching pairs, our proposed SRMatcher is able to deliver more accurate and realistic outcomes. Extensive experiments show that SRMatcher surpasses solid baselines and attains SOTA results on multiple real-world datasets. Compared to the previous SOTA approach GeoFormer, SRMatcher increases the area under the cumulative curve (AUC) by about 11% on HPatches. Additionally, the SRMatcher could serve as a plug-and-play framework for other matching methods like LoFTR, yielding substantial precision improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024</p></details> | None |

AGL-NET tackles two critical challenges: bridging the representation gap between image and points modalities for robust feature matching, and handling inherent scale discrepancies between global view and local view. To address these challenges, AGL-NET leverages a unified network architecture with a novel two-stage matching design. The first stage extracts informative neural features directly from raw sensor data and performs initial feature matching. The second stage refines this matching process by extracting informative skeleton features and incorporating a novel scale alignment step to rectify scale variations between LiDAR and map data. Furthermore, a novel scale and skeleton loss function guides the network toward learning scale-invariant feature representations, eliminating the need for pre-processing satellite maps. This significantly improves real-world applicability in scenarios with unknown map scales. To facilitate rigorous performance evaluation, we introduce a meticulously designed dataset within the CARLA simulator specifically tailored for metric localization training and assessment.

| **[Rethinking Weak-to-Strong Augmentation in Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05557v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free domain adaptive Object Detection (SFOD) aims to transfer a detector (pre-trained on source domain) to new unlabelled target domains. Current SFOD methods typically follow the Mean Teacher framework, where weak-to-strong augmentation provides diverse and sharp contrast for self-supervised learning. However, this augmentation strategy suffers from an inherent problem called crucial semantics loss: Due to random, strong disturbance, strong augmentation is prone to losing typical visual components, hindering cross-domain feature extraction. To address this thus-far ignored limitation, this paper introduces a novel Weak-to-Strong Contrastive Learning (WSCoL) approach. The core idea is to distill semantics lossless knowledge in the weak features (from the weak/teacher branch) to guide the representation learning upon the strong features (from the strong/student branch). To achieve this, we project the original features into a shared space using a mapping network, thereby reducing the bias between the weak and strong features. Meanwhile, a weak features-guided contrastive learning is performed in a weak-to-strong manner alternatively. Specifically, we first conduct an adaptation-aware prototype-guided clustering on the weak features to generate pseudo labels for corresponding strong features matched through proposals. Sequentially, we identify positive-negative samples based on the pseudo labels and perform cross-category contrastive learning on the strong features where an uncertainty estimator encourages adaptive background contrast. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WSCoL yields new state-of-the-art performance, offering a built-in mechanism mitigating crucial semantics loss for traditional Mean Teacher framework. The code and data will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

To augment the localization accuracy and mapping efficacy of SLAM, we refined the core module of the SLAM system. Within the feature matching phase, we introduced cross-validation matching to filter out mismatches. In the keyframe selection strategy, an exponential threshold function is constructed to quantify the keyframe selection process. Compared with a single robot, the multi-robot collaborative SLAM (CSLAM) system substantially improves task execution efficiency and robustness. By employing a centralized structure, we formulate a multi-robot SLAM system and design a coarse-to-fine matching approach for multi-map point cloud registration. Our system, built upon ORB-SLAM3, underwent extensive evaluation utilizing the TUM RGB-D, EuRoC MAV, and TUM_VI datasets. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the positioning accuracy and mapping quality of our enhanced algorithm compared to those of ORB-SLAM3, with a 12.90% reduction in the absolute trajectory error.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Animal Keypoint Detection with Semantic-feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05056v4)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current image-based keypoint detection methods for animal (including human) bodies and faces are generally divided into full-supervised and few-shot class-agnostic approaches. The former typically relies on laborious and time-consuming manual annotations, posing considerable challenges in expanding keypoint detection to a broader range of keypoint categories and animal species. The latter, though less dependent on extensive manual input, still requires necessary support images with annotation for reference during testing. To realize zero-shot keypoint detection without any prior annotation, we introduce the Open-Vocabulary Keypoint Detection (OVKD) task, which is innovatively designed to use text prompts for identifying arbitrary keypoints across any species. In pursuit of this goal, we have developed a novel framework named Open-Vocabulary Keypoint Detection with Semantic-feature Matching (KDSM). This framework synergistically combines vision and language models, creating an interplay between language features and local keypoint visual features. KDSM enhances its capabilities by integrating Domain Distribution Matrix Matching (DDMM) and other special modules, such as the Vision-Keypoint Relational Awareness (VKRA) module, improving the framework's generalizability and overall performance.Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KDSM significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of performance and achieves remarkable success in the OVKD task.Impressively, our method, operating in a zero-shot fashion, still yields results comparable to state-of-the-art few-shot species class-agnostic keypoint detection methods.We will make the source code publicly accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, the dimensional differences in the features of points cloud (three-dimension) and image (two-dimension) continue to pose considerable challenges to their development. The primary challenge resides in the inability to leverage the features of one modality to augment those of another, thereby complicating the alignment of features within the latent space. To address this challenge, we propose an image-to-point-cloud method named as TFCT-I2P. Initially, we introduce a Three-Stream Fusion Network (TFN), which integrates color information from images with structural information from point clouds, facilitating the alignment of features from both modalities. Subsequently, to effectively mitigate patch-level misalignments introduced by the inclusion of color information, we design a Color-Aware Transformer (CAT). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 7Scenes, RGB-D Scenes V2, ScanNet V2, and a self-collected dataset. The results demonstrate that TFCT-I2P surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.5% in Inlier Ratio, 0.4% in Feature Matching Recall, and 5.4% in Registration Recall. Therefore, we believe that the proposed TFCT-I2P contributes to the advancement of I2P registration.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing classic pose estimation methods are object-specific, which can only handle the specific objects seen during training. When applied to a novel object, these methods necessitate a cumbersome onboarding process, which involves extensive dataset preparation and model retraining. The extensive duration and resource consumption of onboarding limit their practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce ZeroPose, a novel zero-shot framework that performs pose estimation following a Discovery-Orientation-Registration (DOR) inference pipeline. This framework generalizes to novel objects without requiring model retraining. Given the CAD model of a novel object, ZeroPose enables in seconds onboarding time to extract visual and geometric embeddings from the CAD model as a prompt. With the prompting of the above embeddings, DOR can discover all related instances and estimate their 6D poses without additional human interaction or presupposing scene conditions. Compared with existing zero-shot methods solved by the render-and-compare paradigm, the DOR pipeline formulates the object pose estimation into a feature-matching problem, which avoids time-consuming online rendering and improves efficiency. Experimental results on the seven datasets show that ZeroPose as a zero-shot method achieves comparable performance with object-specific training methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot method with 50x inference speed improvement.</p></details> |  | None |

This typically involves the integration of data from LiDAR sensors and cameras, which necessitates high-precision and real-time registration. Current methods for registering LiDAR point clouds with images face significant challenges due to inherent modality differences and computational overhead. To address these issues, we propose EEPNet, an advanced network that leverages reflectance maps obtained from point cloud projections to enhance registration accuracy. The introduction of point cloud projections substantially mitigates cross-modality differences at the network input level, while the inclusion of reflectance data improves performance in scenarios with limited spatial information of point cloud within the camera's field of view. Furthermore, by employing edge pixels for feature matching and incorporating an efficient matching optimization layer, EEPNet markedly accelerates real-time registration tasks. Experimental validation demonstrates that EEPNet achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Significant view changes, such as air-to-ground with very sparse view overlap, pose an even greater challenge to the correspondence solvers. We present a novel optimization-based approach that significantly enhances existing feature matching methods by introducing geometry cues in addition to color cues. This helps fill gaps when there is less overlap in large-scale scenarios. Our method formulates geometric verification as an optimization problem, guiding feature matching within detector-free methods and using sparse correspondences from detector-based methods as anchor points. By enforcing geometric constraints via the Sampson Distance, our approach ensures that the denser correspondences from detector-free methods are geometrically consistent and more accurate. This hybrid strategy significantly improves correspondence density and accuracy, mitigates multi-view inconsistencies, and leads to notable advancements in camera pose accuracy and point cloud density. It outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on benchmark datasets and enables feature matching in challenging extreme large-scale settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by the success of Segment Anything Model (SAM) across various downstream tasks, we propose a one-shot and training-free method that perfectly adapts SAM's zero-shot generalization capability to sequential IRSTS. Specifically, we first obtain a confidence map through local feature matching (LFM). The highest point in the confidence map is used as the prompt to replace the manual prompt. Then, to address the over-segmentation issue caused by the domain gap, we design the point prompt-centric focusing (PPCF) module. Subsequently, to prevent miss and false detections, we introduce the triple-level ensemble (TLE) module to produce the final mask. Experiments demonstrate that our method requires only one shot to achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art IRSTS methods and significantly outperforms other one-shot segmentation methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the robustness of our method in the type of annotations and the selection of reference images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most robotic visual navigation methods rely on deep learning models pre-trained on vision tasks, which prioritize salient objects -- not necessarily relevant to navigation and potentially misleading. Alternative approaches train specialized navigation models from scratch, requiring significant computation. On the other hand, self-supervised learning has revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing, but its application to robotic navigation remains underexplored due to the difficulty of defining effective self-supervision signals. Motivated by these observations, in this work, we propose a Self-Supervised Vision-Action Model for Visual Navigation Pre-Training (VANP). Instead of detecting salient objects that are beneficial for tasks such as classification or detection, VANP learns to focus only on specific visual regions that are relevant to the navigation task. To achieve this, VANP uses a history of visual observations, future actions, and a goal image for self-supervision, and embeds them using two small Transformer Encoders. Then, VANP maximizes the information between the embeddings by using a mutual information maximization objective function. We demonstrate that most VANP-extracted features match with human navigation intuition. VANP achieves comparable performance as models learned end-to-end with half the training time and models trained on a large-scale, fully supervised dataset, i.e., ImageNet, with only 0.08% data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted at IROS 2024.

In this paper, we compare the performance of different features, also known as feature extraction and matching methods, applied to satellite imagery. A wide range of stereo pairs(~500) covering two separate study sites are used. SIFT, as a widely used classic feature extraction and matching algorithm, is compared with seven deep-learning matching methods: SuperGlue, LightGlue, LoFTR, ASpanFormer, DKM, GIM-LightGlue, and GIM-DKM.

For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Deep Network for Coastal Super-Resolution (DNCSR) for spatiotemporal enhancement to efficiently learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNCSR learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To efficiently model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes. Their combination contributes to the overall 24% improvements in RMSE.

Unlike traditional methods, the proposed approach leverages state-of-the-art place recognition and learned descriptors to efficiently detect overlap between maps, eliminating the need for the time-consuming global feature extraction and feature matching process. The estimated overlapping regions are used to calculate a homogeneous rigid transform, which serves as an initial condition for the GICP point cloud registration algorithm to refine the alignment between the maps. The advantages of this approach include faster processing time, improved accuracy, and increased robustness in challenging environments.

| **[LSM-YOLO: A Compact and Effective ROI Detector for Medical Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14087v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In existing medical Region of Interest (ROI) detection, there lacks an algorithm that can simultaneously satisfy both real-time performance and accuracy, not meeting the growing demand for automatic detection in medicine. Although the basic YOLO framework ensures real-time detection due to its fast speed, it still faces challenges in maintaining precision concurrently. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel model named Lightweight Shunt Matching-YOLO (LSM-YOLO), with Lightweight Adaptive Extraction (LAE) and Multipath Shunt Feature Matching (MSFM). Firstly, by using LAE to refine feature extraction, the model can obtain more contextual information and high-resolution details from multiscale feature maps, thereby extracting detailed features of ROI in medical images while reducing the influence of noise. Secondly, MSFM is utilized to further refine the fusion of high-level semantic features and low-level visual features, enabling better fusion between ROI features and neighboring features, thereby improving the detection rate for better diagnostic assistance. Experimental results demonstrate that LSM-YOLO achieves 48.6% AP on a private dataset of pancreatic tumors, 65.1% AP on the BCCD blood cell detection public dataset, and 73.0% AP on the Br35h brain tumor detection public dataset. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter cost on the above three datasets.

However, the promising reconstruction performance of existing G-3DGS methods relies heavily on accurate multi-view feature matching, which is quite challenging. Especially for the scenes that have many non-overlapping areas between various views and contain numerous similar regions, the matching performance of existing methods is poor and the reconstruction precision is limited. To address this problem, we develop a strategy that utilizes a predicted depth confidence map to guide accurate local feature matching. In addition, we propose to utilize the knowledge of existing monocular depth estimation models as prior to boost the depth estimation precision in non-overlapping areas between views. Combining the proposed strategies, we present a novel G-3DGS method named TranSplat, which obtains the best performance on both the RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks while maintaining competitive speed and presenting strong cross-dataset generalization ability.

Different from the existing fine-tuning approaches that capture temporal information by exploring the relationships among all the frames, our perceiver-based adapter recurrently captures the sequential dynamics alongside the timeline, which could perceive the order change. To obtain the discriminative representations for each class, we extend a textual corpus for each class derived from the large language models (LLMs) and enrich the visual prototypes by integrating the contextual semantic information. Besides, We introduce an unbalanced optimal transport strategy for feature matching that mitigates the impact of class-unrelated features, thereby facilitating more effective decision-making. Experimental results on five FSAR datasets demonstrate that our method set a new benchmark, beating the second-best competitors with large margins.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, this state-of-the-art performance comes at the cost of substantial memory requirements, as all database images must be stored for feature matching. In contrast, direct 2D-3D matching algorithms require significantly less memory but suffer from lower accuracy due to the larger and more ambiguous search space. We address this ambiguity by fusing local and global descriptors using a weighted average operator within a 2D-3D search framework. This fusion rearranges the local descriptor space such that geographically nearby local descriptors are closer in the feature space according to the global descriptors. Therefore, the number of irrelevant competing descriptors decreases, specifically if they are geographically distant, thereby increasing the likelihood of correctly matching a query descriptor. We consistently improve the accuracy over local-only systems and achieve performance close to hierarchical methods while halving memory requirements. Extensive experiments using various state-of-the-art local and global descriptors across four different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For the first time, our approach enables direct matching algorithms to benefit from global descriptors while maintaining memory efficiency.

Previous studies have used geometric information for extracting features, matching and estimating transformation. Recently, owing to the advancement of RGB-D sensors, researchers have attempted to combine visual and geometric information to improve registration performance. However, these studies focused on extracting distinctive features by deep feature fusion, which cannot effectively solve the negative effects of each feature's weakness, and cannot sufficiently leverage the valid information. In this paper, we propose a new feature combination framework, which applies a looser but more effective combination. An explicit filter based on transformation consistency is designed for the combination framework, which can overcome each feature's weakness. And an adaptive threshold determined by the error distribution is proposed to extract more valid information from the two types of features. Owing to the distinctive design, our proposed framework can estimate more accurate correspondences and is applicable to both hand-crafted and learning-based feature descriptors. Experiments on ScanNet and 3DMatch show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, solving the competition between the detector and the feature extractor has always been a challenge. Meanwhile, the issue of directly embedding the ReID task into MOT has remained unresolved. The lack of high discriminability in appearance features results in their limited utility. In this paper, a new learning approach using cross-correlation to capture temporal information of objects is proposed. The feature extraction network is no longer trained solely on appearance features from each frame but learns richer motion features by utilizing feature heatmaps from consecutive frames, which addresses the challenge of inter-class feature similarity. Furthermore, our learning approach is applied to a more lightweight feature extraction network, and treat the feature matching scores as strong cues rather than auxiliary cues, with an appropriate weight calculation to reflect the compatibility between our obtained features and the MOT task. Our tracker, named TCBTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks, i.e., MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets. Specifically, on the DanceTrack test set, we achieve 56.8 HOTA, 58.1 IDF1 and 92.5 MOTA, making it the best online tracker capable of achieving real-time performance. Comparative evaluations with other trackers prove that our tracker achieves the best balance between speed, robustness and accuracy.

The key insight of our methods is to establish implicit-semantic area matching prior to point matching, based on advanced image understanding of SAM. Then, informative area matches with consistent internal semantic are able to undergo dense feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching. Specifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework and first obtains candidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). Then, area matching among the candidates is formulated as graph energy minimization and solved by graphical models derived from AG. To address the efficiency issue of MESA, we further propose DMESA as its dense counterpart, applying a dense matching framework. After candidate areas are identified by AG, DMESA establishes area matches through generating dense matching distributions. The distributions are produced from off-the-shelf patch matching utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model and refined via the Expectation Maximization. With less repetitive computation, DMESA showcases a speed improvement of nearly five times compared to MESA, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our methods are extensively evaluated on five datasets encompassing indoor and outdoor scenes. The results illustrate consistent performance improvements from our methods for five distinct point matching baselines across all datasets. Furthermore, our methods exhibit promise generalization and improved robustness against image resolution variations.

Most existing US tracking methods, e.g., those based on optical flow or feature matching, were initially designed for RGB images before being applied to US. Therefore domain shift can impact their performance. Training could be supervised by ground-truth correspondences, but these are expensive to acquire in US. To solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised pixel-level tracking model called PIPsUS. Our model can track an arbitrary number of points in one forward pass and exploits temporal information by considering multiple, instead of just consecutive, frames. We developed a new self-supervised training strategy that utilizes a long-term point-tracking model trained for RGB images as a teacher to guide the model to learn realistic motions and use data augmentation to enforce tracking from US appearance. We evaluate our method on neck and oral US and echocardiography, showing higher point tracking accuracy when compared with fast normalized cross-correlation and tuned optical flow.

Extensive research has focused on enhancing localization accuracy by integrating various sensor types to address this issue. This paper introduces a novel approach for car localization, leveraging image features that correspond with highly detailed semantic 3D building models. The core concept involves augmenting positioning accuracy by incorporating prior geometric and semantic knowledge into calculations. The work assesses outcomes using Level of Detail 2 (LoD2) and Level of Detail 3 (LoD3) models, analyzing whether facade-enriched models yield superior accuracy. This comprehensive analysis encompasses diverse methods, including off-the-shelf feature matching and deep learning, facilitating thorough discussion. Our experiments corroborate that LoD3 enables detecting up to 69\% more features than using LoD2 models. We believe that this study will contribute to the research of enhancing positioning accuracy in GNSS-denied urban canyons. It also shows a practical application of under-explored LoD3 building models on map-based car positioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 3D GeoInfo 2024</p></details> | None |

Popular feature-based structure-from-motion (SfM) tools solve this task by incremental reconstruction: they repeat triangulation of sparse 3D points and registration of more camera views to the sparse point cloud. We re-interpret incremental structure-from-motion as an iterated application and refinement of a visual relocalizer, that is, of a method that registers new views to the current state of the reconstruction. This perspective allows us to investigate alternative visual relocalizers that are not rooted in local feature matching. We show that scene coordinate regression, a learning-based relocalization approach, allows us to build implicit, neural scene representations from unposed images. Different from other learning-based reconstruction methods, we do not require pose priors nor sequential inputs, and we optimize efficiently over thousands of images. In many cases, our method, ACE0, estimates camera poses with an accuracy close to feature-based SfM, as demonstrated by novel view synthesis.

Image mosaicking is a technique for aligning multiple overlapping images to obtain a larger FoV. Current mosaicking pipelines often struggle with substantial noise and considerable displacement between the input sub-fields. In this paper, we propose a versatile pipeline for stitching multi-view OCT/OCTA \textit{en face} projection images. Our method combines the strengths of learning-based feature matching and robust pixel-based registration to align multiple images effectively. Furthermore, we advance the application of a trained foundational model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to validate mosaicking results in an unsupervised manner. The efficacy of our pipeline is validated using an in-house dataset and a large public dataset, where our method shows superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Prior arts involve sophisticated designs, e.g., sundry modules for similarity calculation and a two-stage framework, or takes in extra heatmap generation and supervision. We notice that CAPE is essentially a task about feature matching, which can be solved within the attention process. Therefore we first streamline the architecture into a simple baseline consisting of several pure self-attention layers and an MLP regression head -- this simplification means that one only needs to consider the attention quality to boost the performance of CAPE. Towards an effective attention process for CAPE, we further introduce two key modules: i) a global keypoint feature perceptor to inject global semantic information into support keypoints, and ii) a keypoint attention refiner to enhance inter-node correlation between keypoints. They jointly form a Simple and strong Category-Agnostic Pose Estimator (SCAPE). Experimental results show that SCAPE outperforms prior arts by 2.2 and 1.3 PCK under 1-shot and 5-shot settings with faster inference speed and lighter model capacity, excelling in both accuracy and efficiency.

However, existing methods optimize a neural radiance field for each scene, relying heavily on dense training images and extensive computation resources. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce a new method called Efficient Depth-Guided Urban View Synthesis (EDUS) for fast feed-forward inference and efficient per-scene fine-tuning. Different from prior generalizable methods that infer geometry based on feature matching, EDUS leverages noisy predicted geometric priors as guidance to enable generalizable urban view synthesis from sparse input images. The geometric priors allow us to apply our generalizable model directly in the 3D space, gaining robustness across various sparsity levels. Through comprehensive experiments on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, we demonstrate promising generalization abilities on novel street scenes.

Loop closures correct drifts in trajectory estimation to build a globally consistent map. However, a false loop closure can be fatal, so verification is required as an additional step to ensure robustness by rejecting the false positive loops. Geometric verification has been a well-acknowledged solution that leverages spatial clues provided by local feature matching to find true positives. Existing feature matching methods focus on homography and pose estimation in long-term visual localization, lacking references for geometric verification. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a unified benchmark targeting geometric verification of loop closure detection under long-term conditional variations. Furthermore, we evaluate six representative local feature matching methods (handcrafted and learning-based) under the benchmark, with in-depth analysis for limitations and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted by IROS(2024)</p></details> | None |

In this work, we focus on enhancing the scale-awareness of FSM methods for depth estimation. To this end, we propose to improve FSM from two perspectives: depth network structure optimization and training pipeline optimization. First, we construct a transformer-based depth network with neighbor-enhanced cross-view attention (NCA). The cross-attention modules can better aggregate the cross-view context in both global and neighboring views. Second, we formulate a transformer-based feature matching scheme with progressive training to improve the structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline. That allows us to learn scale-awareness with sufficient matches and further facilitate network convergence by removing mismatches based on SfM loss. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting Scale-aware full surround monodepth (SA-FSM) method largely improves the scale-aware depth predictions without median-scaling at the test time, and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art FSM methods, e.g., surpassing SurroundDepth by 3.8% in terms of accuracy at delta<1.25 on the DDAD benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these enhancements fail to address the underlying issues that directly hinder ground-truth matches, including the scarcity of matchable points in small scale images, matching conflicts in dense methods, and the keypoint-repeatability reliance in sparse methods. We propose a novel feature matching method named RCM, which Raises the Ceiling of Matching from three aspects. 1) RCM introduces a dynamic view switching mechanism to address the scarcity of matchable points in source images by strategically switching image pairs. 2) RCM proposes a conflict-free coarse matching module, addressing matching conflicts in the target image through a many-to-one matching strategy. 3) By integrating the semi-sparse paradigm and the coarse-to-fine architecture, RCM preserves the benefits of both high efficiency and global search, mitigating the reliance on keypoint repeatability. As a result, RCM enables more matchable points in the source image to be matched in an exhaustive and conflict-free manner in the target image, leading to a substantial 260% increase in ground-truth matches. Comprehensive experiments show that RCM exhibits remarkable performance and efficiency in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |

This is crucial for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), where the effectiveness is influenced by the regions from which vehicle images are cropped. This study explores whether optimal vehicle detection regions, guided by detection confidence scores, can enhance feature matching and ReID tasks. Using our framework with multiple Regions of Interest (ROIs) and lane-wise vehicle counts, we employed YOLOv8 for detection and DeepSORT for tracking across twelve Indiana Highway videos, including two pairs of videos from non-overlapping cameras. Tracked vehicle images were cropped from inside and outside the ROIs at five-frame intervals. Features were extracted using pre-trained models: ResNet50, ResNeXt50, Vision Transformer, and Swin-Transformer. Feature consistency was assessed through cosine similarity, information entropy, and clustering variance. Results showed that features from images cropped inside ROIs had higher mean cosine similarity values compared to those involving one image inside and one outside the ROIs. The most significant difference was observed during night conditions (0.7842 inside vs. 0.5 outside the ROI with Swin-Transformer) and in cross-camera scenarios (0.75 inside-inside vs. 0.52 inside-outside the ROI with Vision Transformer). Information entropy and clustering variance further supported that features in ROIs are more consistent. These findings suggest that strategically selected ROIs can enhance tracking performance and ReID accuracy in ITS.</p></details> |  | None |

We then use a nearest-neighbor feature matching loss to finetune the Gaussians of the selected objects, aligning their spherical harmonic coefficients with the style image to ensure consistency and visual appeal. StyleSplat allows for quick, customizable style transfer and localized stylization of multiple objects within a scene, each with a different style.

However, the presence of moving objects in dynamic scenes introduces inevitable inconsistencies, causing misaligned multi-frame feature matching and misleading self-supervision during training. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ProDepth, which effectively addresses the mismatch problem caused by dynamic objects using a probabilistic approach. We initially deduce the uncertainty associated with static scene assumption by adopting an auxiliary decoder. This decoder analyzes inconsistencies embedded in the cost volume, inferring the probability of areas being dynamic. We then directly rectify the erroneous cost volume for dynamic areas through a Probabilistic Cost Volume Modulation (PCVM) module. Specifically, we derive probability distributions of depth candidates from both single-frame and multi-frame cues, modulating the cost volume by adaptively fusing those distributions based on the inferred uncertainty. Additionally, we present a self-supervision loss reweighting strategy that not only masks out incorrect supervision with high uncertainty but also mitigates the risks in remaining possible dynamic areas in accordance with the probability. Our proposed method excels over state-of-the-art approaches in all metrics on both Cityscapes and KITTI datasets, and demonstrates superior generalization ability on the Waymo Open dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024.

The map is a graph where each node codes a colon location by a set of real images, while edges represent traversability between nodes. For close-in-time images, where scene changes are minor, place recognition can be successfully managed with the recent transformers-based local feature matching algorithms. However, under long-term changes -- such as different colonoscopies of the same patient -- feature-based matching fails. To address this, we train on real colonoscopies a deep global descriptor achieving high recall with significant changes in the scene. The addition of a Bayesian filter boosts the accuracy of long-term place recognition, enabling relocalization in a previously built map. Our experiments show that ColonMapper is able to autonomously build a map and localize against it in two important use cases: localization within the same colonoscopy or within different colonoscopies of the same patient.

However, directly applying SAM to surgical images has key limitations including (1) the requirement of image-specific prompts at test-time, thereby preventing fully automated segmentation, and (2) ineffectiveness due to substantial domain gap between natural and surgical images. In this work, we propose CycleSAM, an approach for one-shot surgical scene segmentation that uses the training image-mask pair at test-time to automatically identify points in the test images that correspond to each object class, which can then be used to prompt SAM to produce object masks. To produce high-fidelity matches, we introduce a novel spatial cycle-consistency constraint that enforces point proposals in the test image to rematch to points within the object foreground region in the training image. Then, to address the domain gap, rather than directly using the visual features from SAM, we employ a ResNet50 encoder pretrained on surgical images in a self-supervised fashion, thereby maintaining high label-efficiency. We evaluate CycleSAM for one-shot segmentation on two diverse surgical semantic segmentation datasets, comprehensively outperforming baseline approaches and reaching up to 50% of fully-supervised performance.</p></details> |  | None |

We instead choose to leverage the power of existing 2D foundation models and present a novel, training-free framework, CryoSAM. In addition to prompt-based single-particle instance segmentation, our approach can automatically search for similar features, facilitating full tomogram semantic segmentation with only one prompt. CryoSAM is composed of two major parts: 1) a prompt-based 3D segmentation system that uses prompts to complete single-particle instance segmentation recursively with Cross-Plane Self-Prompting, and 2) a Hierarchical Feature Matching mechanism that efficiently matches relevant features with extracted tomogram features. They collaborate to enable the segmentation of all particles of one category with just one particle-specific prompt. Our experiments show that CryoSAM outperforms existing works by a significant margin and requires even fewer annotations in particle picking. Further visualizations demonstrate its ability when dealing with full tomogram segmentation for various subcellular structures.

Since these tasks rely on identifying point correspondences between input images within the static part of the environment, we propose a graph neural network-based sparse feature matching network designed to perform robust matching under challenging conditions while excluding keypoints on moving objects. We employ a similar scheme of attentional aggregation over graph edges to enhance keypoint representations as state-of-the-art feature-matching networks but augment the graph with epipolar and temporal information and vastly reduce the number of graph edges. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised training scheme to extract pseudo labels for image pairs in dynamic environments from exclusively unprocessed visual-inertial data. A series of experiments show the superior performance of our network as it excludes keypoints on moving objects compared to state-of-the-art feature matching networks while still achieving similar results regarding conventional matching metrics. When integrated into a SLAM system, our network significantly improves performance, especially in highly dynamic scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent work has successfully used affine correspondences to solve various relative camera pose estimation problems, less attention has been given to their use in absolute pose estimation. We introduce the first general solution to the problem of estimating the pose of a calibrated camera given a single observation of an oriented point and an affine correspondence. The advantage of our approach (P1AC) is that it requires only a single correspondence, in comparison to the traditional point-based approach (P3P), significantly reducing the combinatorics in robust estimation. P1AC provides a general solution that removes restrictive assumptions made in prior work and is applicable to large-scale image-based localization. We propose a minimal solution to the P1AC problem and evaluate our novel solver on synthetic data, showing its numerical stability and performance under various types of noise. On standard image-based localization benchmarks we show that P1AC achieves more accurate results than the widely used P3P algorithm.

However, many SSL approaches only pay attention to low-level consistency and overlook the significance of pseudo-label reliability. Therefore, in this work, we propose an adversarial self-training consistency framework (AstMatch). Firstly, we design an adversarial consistency regularization (ACR) approach to enhance knowledge transfer and strengthen prediction consistency under varying perturbation intensities. Second, we apply a feature matching loss for adversarial training to incorporate high-level consistency regularization. Additionally, we present the pyramid channel attention (PCA) and efficient channel and spatial attention (ECSA) modules to improve the discriminator's performance. Finally, we propose an adaptive self-training (AST) approach to ensure the pseudo-labels' quality. The proposed AstMatch has been extensively evaluated with cutting-edge SSL methods on three public-available datasets. The experimental results under different labeled ratios indicate that AstMatch outperforms other existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Although deep learning-based local features excel at capturing high-level information and perform well on matching benchmarks, they struggle with generalization in continuous motion scenes, adversely affecting loop detection accuracy. Our system employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy to optimize the training of keypoint extraction networks, enhancing their adaptability to diverse environments. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine feature tracking mechanism for learned keypoints. It begins with a direct method to approximate the relative pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for refined pose estimation. To mitigate cumulative positioning errors, DK-SLAM incorporates a novel online learning module that utilizes binary features for loop closure detection. This module dynamically identifies loop nodes within a sequence, ensuring accurate and efficient localization. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DK-SLAM outperforms leading traditional and learning based SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM3 and LIFT-SLAM. These results underscore the efficacy and robustness of our DK-SLAM in varied and challenging real-world environments.</p></details> | In submission | None |

The lack of domain-independent automatic segmentation tools for the GBM necessitates an AI-based solution to automate the process. In this study, we introduce GBMSeg, a training-free framework designed to automatically segment the GBM in TEM images guided only by a one-shot annotated reference. Specifically, GBMSeg first exploits the robust feature matching capabilities of the pretrained foundation model to generate initial prompt points, then introduces a series of novel automatic prompt engineering techniques across the feature and physical space to optimize the prompt scheme. Finally, GBMSeg employs a class-agnostic foundation segmentation model with the generated prompt scheme to obtain accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on our collected 2538 TEM images confirm that GBMSeg achieves superior segmentation performance with a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 87.27% using only one labeled reference image in a training-free manner, outperforming recently proposed one-shot or few-shot methods. In summary, GBMSeg introduces a distinctive automatic prompt framework that facilitates robust domain-independent segmentation performance without training, particularly advancing the automatic prompting of foundation segmentation models for medical images. Future work involves automating the thickness measurement of segmented GBM and quantifying pathological indicators, holding significant potential for advancing pathology assessments in clinical applications.

Offline, target-based approaches have long been the preferred choice in this field. However, they often demonstrate poor adaptability to real-world environments. This is largely because extrinsic parameters may change significantly due to moderate shocks or during extended operations in environments with vibrations. In contrast, online, target-free approaches provide greater adaptability yet typically lack robustness, primarily due to the challenges in cross-modal feature matching. Therefore, in this article, we unleash the full potential of large vision models (LVMs), which are emerging as a significant trend in the fields of computer vision and robotics, especially for embodied artificial intelligence, to achieve robust and accurate online, target-free LCEC across a variety of challenging scenarios. Our main contributions are threefold: we introduce a novel framework known as MIAS-LCEC, provide an open-source versatile calibration toolbox with an interactive visualization interface, and publish three real-world datasets captured from various indoor and outdoor environments. The cornerstone of our framework and toolbox is the cross-modal mask matching (C3M) algorithm, developed based on a state-of-the-art (SoTA) LVM and capable of generating sufficient and reliable matches. Extensive experiments conducted on these real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach and its superior performance compared to SoTA methods, particularly for the solid-state LiDARs with super-wide fields of view.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IEEE Trans. on Intelligent Vehicles (T-IV)</p></details> | None |

However, its effectiveness is hampered when working with sparsely available views, often leading to performance dips due to overfitting. FreeNeRF attempts to overcome this limitation by integrating implicit geometry regularization, which incrementally improves both geometry and textures. Nonetheless, an initial low positional encoding bandwidth results in the exclusion of high-frequency elements. The quest for a holistic approach that simultaneously addresses overfitting and the preservation of high-frequency details remains ongoing. This study introduces a novel feature matching based sparse geometry regularization module. This module excels in pinpointing high-frequency keypoints, thereby safeguarding the integrity of fine details. Through progressive refinement of geometry and textures across NeRF iterations, we unveil an effective few-shot neural rendering architecture, designated as SGCNeRF, for enhanced novel view synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that SGCNeRF not only achieves superior geometry-consistent outcomes but also surpasses FreeNeRF, with improvements of 0.7 dB and 0.6 dB in PSNR on the LLFF and DTU datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

ProMotion offers a range of compelling attributes that set it apart from current task-specific paradigms. We adopt a prototypical perspective, establishing a unified paradigm that harmonizes disparate motion learning approaches. This novel paradigm streamlines the architectural design, enabling the simultaneous assimilation of diverse motion information. We capitalize on a dual mechanism involving the feature denoiser and the prototypical learner to decipher the intricacies of motion. This approach effectively circumvents the pitfalls of ambiguity in pixel-wise feature matching, significantly bolstering the robustness of motion representation. We demonstrate a profound degree of transferability across distinct motion patterns. This inherent versatility reverberates robustly across a comprehensive spectrum of both 2D and 3D downstream tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that ProMotion outperforms various well-known specialized architectures, achieving 0.54 and 0.054 Abs Rel error on the Sintel and KITTI depth datasets, 1.04 and 2.01 average endpoint error on the clean and final pass of Sintel flow benchmark, and 4.30 F1-all error on the KITTI flow benchmark. For its efficacy, we hope our work can catalyze a paradigm shift in universal models in computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |
| **[A Self-Supervised Denoising Strategy for Underwater Acoustic Camera Imageries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02914v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In low-visibility marine environments characterized by turbidity and darkness, acoustic cameras serve as visual sensors capable of generating high-resolution 2D sonar images. However, acoustic camera images are interfered with by complex noise and are difficult to be directly ingested by downstream visual algorithms. This paper introduces a novel strategy for denoising acoustic camera images using deep learning techniques, which comprises two principal components: a self-supervised denoising framework and a fine feature-guided block. Additionally, the study explores the relationship between the level of image denoising and the improvement in feature-matching performance. Experimental results show that the proposed denoising strategy can effectively filter acoustic camera images without prior knowledge of the noise model. The denoising process is nearly end-to-end without complex parameter tuning and post-processing. It successfully removes noise while preserving fine feature details, thereby enhancing the performance of local feature matching.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Our method can be used to optimize through any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target (stylized) output and leverages gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency. We demonstrate a surprisingly wide-range of applications for music generation including inpainting, outpainting, and looping as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control - all without ever fine-tuning the underlying model. When we compare our approach against related training, guidance, and optimization-based methods, we find DITTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks, including outperforming comparable approaches on controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency, thus opening the door for high-quality, flexible, training-free control of diffusion models.

By capturing omnidirectional views of a scene, these cameras could expedite building environment models that are essential for visual localization. However, such an advantage is often overlooked due to the lack of valuable datasets. This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset, 360Loc, composed of 360$^\circ$ images with ground truth poses for visual localization. We present a practical implementation of 360$^\circ$ mapping combining 360$^\circ$ images with lidar data to generate the ground truth 6DoF poses. 360Loc is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of cross-device visual positioning, involving 360$^\circ$ reference frames, and query frames from pinhole, ultra-wide FoV fisheye, and 360$^\circ$ cameras. We propose a virtual camera approach to generate lower-FoV query frames from 360$^\circ$ images, which ensures a fair comparison of performance among different query types in visual localization tasks. We also extend this virtual camera approach to feature matching-based and pose regression-based methods to alleviate the performance loss caused by the cross-device domain gap, and evaluate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art baselines. We demonstrate that omnidirectional visual localization is more robust in challenging large-scale scenes with symmetries and repetitive structures. These results provide new insights into 360-camera mapping and omnidirectional visual localization with cross-device queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

| **[Single image super-resolution based on trainable feature matching attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18872v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely employed for image Super-Resolution (SR) in recent years. Various techniques enhance SR performance by altering CNN structures or incorporating improved self-attention mechanisms. Interestingly, these advancements share a common trait. Instead of explicitly learning high-frequency details, they learn an implicit feature processing mode that utilizes weighted sums of a feature map's own elements for reconstruction, akin to convolution and non-local. In contrast, early dictionary-based approaches learn feature decompositions explicitly to match and rebuild Low-Resolution (LR) features. Building on this analysis, we introduce Trainable Feature Matching (TFM) to amalgamate this explicit feature learning into CNNs, augmenting their representation capabilities. Within TFM, trainable feature sets are integrated to explicitly learn features from training images through feature matching. Furthermore, we integrate non-local and channel attention into our proposed Trainable Feature Matching Attention Network (TFMAN) to further enhance SR performance. To alleviate the computational demands of non-local operations, we propose a streamlined variant called Same-size-divided Region-level Non-Local (SRNL). SRNL conducts non-local computations in parallel on blocks uniformly divided from the input feature map. The efficacy of TFM and SRNL is validated through ablation studies and module explorations. We employ a recurrent convolutional network as the backbone of our TFMAN to optimize parameter utilization. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TFMAN achieves superior results in most comparisons while using fewer parameters.

We choose cloth and rope because they are traditionally some of the most difficult deformable objects to analytically model with their large configuration space, and they are meaningful in the context of robotic tasks like cloth folding, rope knot-tying, T-shirt folding, curtain closing, etc. The correspondence problem is heavily motivated in robotics, with wide-ranging applications including semantic grasping, object tracking, and manipulation policies built on top of correspondences. We present an exhaustive survey of existing classical methods for doing correspondence via feature-matching, including SIFT, SURF, and ORB, and two recently published learning-based methods including TimeCycle and Dense Object Nets. We make three main contributions: (1) a framework for simulating and rendering synthetic images of deformable objects, with qualitative results demonstrating transfer between our simulated and real domains (2) a new learning-based correspondence method extending Dense Object Nets, and (3) a standardized comparison across state-of-the-art correspondence methods. Our proposed method provides a flexible, general formulation for learning temporally and spatially continuous correspondences for nonrigid (and rigid) objects. We report root mean squared error statistics for all methods and find that Dense Object Nets outperforms baseline classical methods for correspondence, and our proposed extension of Dense Object Nets performs similarly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Outlier-Robust Long-Term Robotic Mapping Leveraging Ground Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11176v3)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable advancements in deep learning-based perception technologies and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), one can face the failure of these approaches when robots encounter scenarios outside their modeled experiences (here, the term modeling encompasses both conventional pattern finding and data-driven approaches). In particular, because learning-based methods are prone to catastrophic failure when operated in untrained scenes, there is still a demand for conventional yet robust approaches that work out of the box in diverse scenarios, such as real-world robotic services and SLAM competitions. In addition, the dynamic nature of real-world environments, characterized by changing surroundings over time and the presence of moving objects, leads to undesirable data points that hinder a robot from localization and path planning. Consequently, methodologies that enable long-term map management, such as multi-session SLAM and static map building, become essential. Therefore, to achieve a robust long-term robotic mapping system that can work out of the box, first, I propose (i) fast and robust ground segmentation to reject the ground points, which are featureless and thus not helpful for localization and mapping. Then, by employing the concept of graduated non-convexity (GNC), I propose (ii) outlier-robust registration with ground segmentation that overcomes the presence of gross outliers within the feature matching results, and (iii) hierarchical multi-session SLAM that not only uses our proposed GNC-based registration but also employs a GNC solver to be robust against outlier loop candidates. Finally, I propose (iv) instance-aware static map building that can handle the presence of moving objects in the environment based on the observation that most moving objects in urban environments are inevitably in contact with the ground.</p></details> | <details><summary>RSS P...</summary><p>RSS Pioneers 2024 Research Statement</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Feature Selection for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment by Mitigating Semantic Noise Sensitivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06158v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current state-of-the-art No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods typically rely on feature extraction from upstream semantic backbone networks, assuming that all extracted features are relevant. However, we make a key observation that not all features are beneficial, and some may even be harmful, necessitating careful selection. Empirically, we find that many image pairs with small feature spatial distances can have vastly different quality scores, indicating that the extracted features may contain a significant amount of quality-irrelevant noise. To address this issue, we propose a Quality-Aware Feature Matching IQA Metric (QFM-IQM) that employs an adversarial perspective to remove harmful semantic noise features from the upstream task. Specifically, QFM-IQM enhances the semantic noise distinguish capabilities by matching image pairs with similar quality scores but varying semantic features as adversarial semantic noise and adaptively adjusting the upstream task's features by reducing sensitivity to adversarial noise perturbation. Furthermore, we utilize a distillation framework to expand the dataset and improve the model's generalization ability. Our approach achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods on eight standard IQA datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Current stereo matching methods generally adopt the deep Siamese neural network architecture, and have achieved impressing performance by constructing feature matching cost volumes and using 3D convolutions for cost aggregation. However, most existing methods suffer from large number of parameters and slow running time due to the sequential use of 3D convolutions. In this paper, we propose Ghost-Stereo, a novel end-to-end stereo matching network. The feature extraction part of the network uses the GhostNet to form a U-shaped structure. The core of Ghost-Stereo is a GhostNet feature-based cost volume enhancement (Ghost-CVE) module and a GhostNet-inspired lightweight cost volume aggregation (Ghost-CVA) module. For the Ghost-CVE part, cost volumes are constructed and fused by the GhostNet-based features to enhance the spatial context awareness. For the Ghost-CVA part, a lightweight 3D convolution bottleneck block based on the GhostNet is proposed to reduce the computational complexity in this module. By combining with the context and geometry fusion module, a classical hourglass-shaped cost volume aggregate structure is constructed. Ghost-Stereo achieves a comparable performance than state-of-the-art real-time methods on several publicly benchmarks, and shows a better generalization ability.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we proposed EVI-SAM to tackle the problem of 6 DoF pose tracking and 3D reconstruction using monocular event camera. A novel event-based hybrid tracking framework is designed to estimate the pose, leveraging the robustness of feature matching and the precision of direct alignment. Specifically, we develop an event-based 2D-2D alignment to construct the photometric constraint, and tightly integrate it with the event-based reprojection constraint. The mapping module recovers the dense and colorful depth of the scene through the image-guided event-based mapping method. Subsequently, the appearance, texture, and surface mesh of the 3D scene can be reconstructed by fusing the dense depth map from multiple viewpoints using truncated signed distance function (TSDF) fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-learning work to realize event-based dense mapping. Numerical evaluations are performed on both publicly available and self-collected datasets, which qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Our EVI-SAM effectively balances accuracy and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency, showcasing superior pose tracking and dense mapping performance in challenging scenarios.

However, our investigation shows that despite these gains, their potential for real-world applications is restricted by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this paper, we introduce OmniGlue, the first learnable image matcher that is designed with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process, boosting generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally, we propose a novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial and appearance information, leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform comprehensive experiments on a suite of $7$ datasets with varied image domains, including scene-level, object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlue's novel components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of $20.9\%$ with respect to a directly comparable reference model, while also outperforming the recent LightGlue method by $9.5\%$ relatively.Code and model can be found at https://hwjiang1510.github.io/OmniGlue</p></details> | CVPR 2024 | [Code Link](https://hwjiang1510.github.io/OmniGlue) |

Existing methods compute the similarity between the query image and exemplars in the 2D spatial domain and perform regression to obtain the counting number. However, these methods overlook the rich information about the spatial distribution of similarity on the exemplar images, leading to significant impact on matching accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a network learning Spatial Similarity Distribution (SSD) for few-shot object counting, which preserves the spatial structure of exemplar features and calculates a 4D similarity pyramid point-to-point between the query features and exemplar features, capturing the complete distribution information for each point in the 4D similarity space. We propose a Similarity Learning Module (SLM) which applies the efficient center-pivot 4D convolutions on the similarity pyramid to map different similarity distributions to distinct predicted density values, thereby obtaining accurate count. Furthermore, we also introduce a Feature Cross Enhancement (FCE) module that enhances query and exemplar features mutually to improve the accuracy of feature matching.

In this work, we focus on the domain generalization problem in MVS. To evaluate the generalization results, we build a novel MVS domain generalization benchmark including synthetic and real-world datasets. In contrast to conventional domain generalization benchmarks, we consider a more realistic but challenging scenario, where only one source domain is available for training. The MVS problem can be analogized back to the feature matching task, and maintaining robust feature consistency among views is an important factor for improving generalization performance. To address the domain generalization problem in MVS, we propose a novel MVS framework, namely RobustMVS. A DepthClustering-guided Whitening (DCW) loss is further introduced to preserve the feature consistency among different views, which decorrelates multi-view features from viewpoint-specific style information based on geometric priors from depth maps. The experimental results further show that our method achieves superior performance on the domain generalization benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TCSVT.

Nevertheless, global feature matching ignores scene motion context, failing to satisfy temporal consistency. Even though some methods introduce local matching branch to achieve smooth propagation, they fail to model complex appearance changes due to the constraints of the local window. In this paper, we present DeVOS (Deformable VOS), an architecture for Video Object Segmentation that combines memory-based matching with motion-guided propagation resulting in stable long-term modeling and strong temporal consistency. For short-term local propagation, we propose a novel attention mechanism ADVA (Adaptive Deformable Video Attention), allowing the adaption of similarity search region to query-specific semantic features, which ensures robust tracking of complex shape and scale changes. DeVOS employs an optical flow to obtain scene motion features which are further injected to deformable attention as strong priors to learnable offsets. Our method achieves top-rank performance on DAVIS 2017 val and test-dev (88.1%, 83.0%), YouTube-VOS 2019 val (86.6%) while featuring consistent run-time speed and stable memory consumption</p></details> |  | None |

Many recent studies have adopted the branch and bound (BnB) optimization framework to solve the correspondence-based point cloud registration problem globally and deterministically. Nonetheless, BnB-based methods are time-consuming to search the entire 6-dimensional parameter space, since their computational complexity is exponential to the solution domain dimension in the worst-case. To enhance algorithm efficiency, existing works attempt to decouple the 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) original problem into two 3-DOF sub-problems, thereby reducing the search space. In contrast, our approach introduces a novel pose decoupling strategy based on residual projections, decomposing the raw registration problem into three sub-problems. Subsequently, we embed interval stabbing into BnB to solve these sub-problems within a lower two-dimensional domain, resulting in efficient and deterministic registration. Moreover, our method can be adapted to address the challenging problem of simultaneous pose and registration. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency while maintaining comparable robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Early works were centered around one-class-one-model paradigm, which poses significant challenges in large-scale production environments. Knowledge-distillation based multi-class anomaly detection promises a low latency with a reasonably good performance but with a significant drop as compared to one-class version. We propose a DCAM (Distributed Convolutional Attention Module) which improves the distillation process between teacher and student networks when there is a high variance among multiple classes or objects. Integrated multi-scale feature matching strategy to utilise a mixture of multi-level knowledge from the feature pyramid of the two networks, intuitively helping in detecting anomalies of varying sizes which is also an inherent problem in the multi-class scenario. Briefly, our DCAM module consists of Convolutional Attention blocks distributed across the feature maps of the student network, which essentially learns to masks the irrelevant information during student learning alleviating the "cross-class interference" problem. This process is accompanied by minimizing the relative entropy using KL-Divergence in Spatial dimension and a Channel-wise Cosine Similarity between the same feature maps of teacher and student. The losses enables to achieve scale-invariance and capture non-linear relationships. We also highlight that the DCAM module would only be used during training and not during inference as we only need the learned feature maps and losses for anomaly scoring and hence, gaining a performance gain of 3.92% than the multi-class baseline with a preserved latency.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

However, traditional manual feature-based methods in challenging lighting environments make it difficult to ensure robustness and accuracy. Some deep learning-based methods show potential but still have significant drawbacks. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid system for visual SLAM based on the LightGlue deep learning network. It uses deep local feature descriptors to replace traditional hand-crafted features and a more efficient and accurate deep network to achieve fast and precise feature matching. Thus, we use the robustness of deep learning to improve the whole system. We have combined traditional geometry-based approaches to introduce a complete visual SLAM system for monocular, binocular, and RGB-D sensors. We thoroughly tested the proposed system on four public datasets: KITTI, EuRoC, TUM, and 4Season, as well as on actual campus scenes. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits better accuracy and robustness in adapting to low-light and strongly light-varying environments than traditional manual features and deep learning-based methods. It can also run on GPU in real time.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the matching of off-track HSR optical satellite stereos often encounters challenging conditions including wide-baseline observation, significant radiometric differences, multi-temporal changes, varying spatial resolutions, inconsistent spectral resolution, and diverse sensors. In this study, we evaluate various advanced feature matching algorithms for HSR optical satellite stereos. Utilizing a specially constructed dataset from five satellites across six challenging scenarios, HSROSS Dataset, we conduct a comparative analysis of four algorithms: the traditional SIFT, and deep-learning based methods including SuperPoint + SuperGlue, SuperPoint + LightGlue, and LoFTR. Our findings highlight overall superior performance of SuperPoint + LightGlue in balancing robustness, accuracy, distribution, and efficiency, showcasing its potential in complex HSR optical satellite scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is accepted as Oral Presentation in IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium(IGARSS 2024)</p></details> | None |

Kalman filters, although efficient in noise compensation, demand extensive tuning of system and noise models. This paper introduces FlexKalmanNet, a novel modular framework that bridges this gap by integrating a deep fully connected neural network with Kalman filter-based motion estimation algorithms. FlexKalmanNet's core innovation is its ability to learn any Kalman filter parameter directly from measurement data, coupled with the flexibility to utilize various Kalman filter variants. This is achieved through a notable design decision to outsource the sequential computation from the neural network to the Kalman filter variant, enabling a purely feedforward neural network architecture. This architecture, proficient at handling complex, nonlinear features without the dependency on recurrent network modules, captures global data patterns more effectively. Empirical evaluation using data from NASA's Astrobee simulation environment focuses on learning unknown parameters of an Extended Kalman filter for spacecraft pose and twist estimation. The results demonstrate FlexKalmanNet's rapid training convergence, high accuracy, and superior performance against manually tuned Extended Kalman filters.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, recent works such as ARF, use a radiance field-based approach with style constraints to generate 3D scenes that resemble a style image provided by the user. However, these methods lack fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce Controllable Artistic Radiance Fields (CoARF), a novel algorithm for controllable 3D scene stylization. CoARF enables style transfer for specified objects, compositional 3D style transfer and semantic-aware style transfer. We achieve controllability using segmentation masks with different label-dependent loss functions. We also propose a semantic-aware nearest neighbor matching algorithm to improve the style transfer quality. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CoARF provides user-specified controllability of style transfer and superior style transfer quality with more precise feature matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on 3D Vision 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Wav2code: Restore Clean Speech Representations via Codebook Lookup for Noise-Robust ASR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04974v3)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has gained remarkable successes thanks to recent advances of deep learning, but it usually degrades significantly under real-world noisy conditions. Recent works introduce speech enhancement (SE) as front-end to improve speech quality, which is proved effective but may not be optimal for downstream ASR due to speech distortion problem. Based on that, latest works combine SE and currently popular self-supervised learning (SSL) to alleviate distortion and improve noise robustness. Despite the effectiveness, the speech distortion caused by conventional SE still cannot be cleared out. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework named Wav2code to implement a feature-level SE with reduced distortions for noise-robust ASR. First, in pre-training stage the clean speech representations from SSL model are sent to lookup a discrete codebook via nearest-neighbor feature matching, the resulted code sequence are then exploited to reconstruct the original clean representations, in order to store them in codebook as prior. Second, during finetuning we propose a Transformer-based code predictor to accurately predict clean codes by modeling the global dependency of input noisy representations, which enables discovery and restoration of high-quality clean representations with reduced distortions. Furthermore, we propose an interactive feature fusion network to combine original noisy and the restored clean representations to consider both fidelity and quality, resulting in more informative features for downstream ASR. Finally, experiments on both synthetic and real noisy datasets demonstrate that Wav2code can solve the speech distortion and improve ASR performance under various noisy conditions, resulting in stronger robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing</p></details> | None |

Despite their superior performance, diffusion models are not without drawbacks; they are characterized by complex architectures and substantial computational demands, resulting in significant latency due to their iterative sampling process. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a dual approach involving model miniaturization and a reduction in sampling steps, aimed at significantly decreasing model latency. Our methodology leverages knowledge distillation to streamline the U-Net and image decoder architectures, and introduces an innovative one-step DM training technique that utilizes feature matching and score distillation. We present two models, SDXS-512 and SDXS-1024, achieving inference speeds of approximately 100 FPS (30x faster than SD v1.5) and 30 FPS (60x faster than SDXL) on a single GPU, respectively. Moreover, our training approach offers promising applications in image-conditioned control, facilitating efficient image-to-image translation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BAA-NGP: Bundle-Adjusting Accelerated Neural Graphics Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04166v4)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit neural representations have become pivotal in robotic perception, enabling robots to comprehend 3D environments from 2D images. Given a set of camera poses and associated images, the models can be trained to synthesize novel, unseen views. To successfully navigate and interact in dynamic settings, robots require the understanding of their spatial surroundings driven by unassisted reconstruction of 3D scenes and camera poses from real-time video footage. Existing approaches like COLMAP and bundle-adjusting neural radiance field methods take hours to days to process due to the high computational demands of feature matching, dense point sampling, and training of a multi-layer perceptron structure with a large number of parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called bundle-adjusting accelerated neural graphics primitives (BAA-NGP) which leverages accelerated sampling and hash encoding to expedite automatic pose refinement/estimation and 3D scene reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate 10 to 20 x speed improvement compared to other bundle-adjusting neural radiance field methods without sacrificing the quality of pose estimation.

Unlike visible images, TIR images are less susceptible to adverse lighting and weather conditions but present difficulties in matching due to significant texture and intensity differences. Current hand-crafted and learning-based methods for visible-TIR matching fall short in handling viewpoint, scale, and texture diversities. To address this, XoFTR incorporates masked image modeling pre-training and fine-tuning with pseudo-thermal image augmentation to handle the modality differences. Additionally, we introduce a refined matching pipeline that adjusts for scale discrepancies and enhances match reliability through sub-pixel level refinement. To validate our approach, we collect a comprehensive visible-thermal dataset, and show that our method outperforms existing methods on many benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR Image Matching Workshop, 2024. 12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables.

However, due to the modality difference between images and points, it is difficult to learn robust and discriminative cross-modality features by existing metric learning methods for feature matching. Instead of applying metric learning on cross-modality data, we propose to unify the modality between images and point clouds by pretrained large-scale models first, and then establish robust correspondence within the same modality. We show that the intermediate features, called diffusion features, extracted by depth-to-image diffusion models are semantically consistent between images and point clouds, which enables the building of coarse but robust cross-modality correspondences. We further extract geometric features on depth maps produced by the monocular depth estimator. By matching such geometric features, we significantly improve the accuracy of the coarse correspondences produced by diffusion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that without any task-specific training, direct utilization of both features produces accurate image-to-point cloud registration. On three public indoor and outdoor benchmarks, the proposed method averagely achieves a 20.6 percent improvement in Inlier Ratio, a three-fold higher Inlier Number, and a 48.6 percent improvement in Registration Recall than existing state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>CameraReady version for ICLR 2024.

| **[Unsupervised Visible-Infrared ReID via Pseudo-label Correction and Modality-level Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06683v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (UVI-ReID) has recently gained great attention due to its potential for enhancing human detection in diverse environments without labeling. Previous methods utilize intra-modality clustering and cross-modality feature matching to achieve UVI-ReID. However, there exist two challenges: 1) noisy pseudo labels might be generated in the clustering process, and 2) the cross-modality feature alignment via matching the marginal distribution of visible and infrared modalities may misalign the different identities from two modalities. In this paper, we first conduct a theoretic analysis where an interpretable generalization upper bound is introduced. Based on the analysis, we then propose a novel unsupervised cross-modality person re-identification framework (PRAISE). Specifically, to address the first challenge, we propose a pseudo-label correction strategy that utilizes a Beta Mixture Model to predict the probability of mis-clustering based network's memory effect and rectifies the correspondence by adding a perceptual term to contrastive learning. Next, we introduce a modality-level alignment strategy that generates paired visible-infrared latent features and reduces the modality gap by aligning the labeling function of visible and infrared features to learn identity discriminative and modality-invariant features. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance than the unsupervised visible-ReID methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Multi-level Association for Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06265v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing semi-supervised video object segmentation methods either focus on temporal feature matching or spatial-temporal feature modeling. However, they do not address the issues of sufficient target interaction and efficient parallel processing simultaneously, thereby constraining the learning of dynamic, target-aware features. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal multi-level association framework, which jointly associates reference frame, test frame, and object features to achieve sufficient interaction and parallel target ID association with a spatial-temporal memory bank for efficient video object segmentation. Specifically, we construct a spatial-temporal multi-level feature association module to learn better target-aware features, which formulates feature extraction and interaction as the efficient operations of object self-attention, reference object enhancement, and test reference correlation. In addition, we propose a spatial-temporal memory to assist feature association and temporal ID assignment and correlation. We evaluate the proposed method by conducting extensive experiments on numerous video object segmentation datasets, including DAVIS 2016/2017 val, DAVIS 2017 test-dev, and YouTube-VOS 2018/2019 val. The favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[MESA: Matching Everything by Segmenting Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16741v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching is a crucial task in the field of computer vision, which involves finding correspondences between images. Previous studies achieve remarkable performance using learning-based feature comparison. However, the pervasive presence of matching redundancy between images gives rise to unnecessary and error-prone computations in these methods, imposing limitations on their accuracy. To address this issue, we propose MESA, a novel approach to establish precise area (or region) matches for efficient matching redundancy reduction. MESA first leverages the advanced image understanding capability of SAM, a state-of-the-art foundation model for image segmentation, to obtain image areas with implicit semantic. Then, a multi-relational graph is proposed to model the spatial structure of these areas and construct their scale hierarchy. Based on graphical models derived from the graph, the area matching is reformulated as an energy minimization task and effectively resolved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MESA yields substantial precision improvement for multiple point matchers in indoor and outdoor downstream tasks, e.g. +13.61% for DKM in indoor pose estimation.</p></details> | CVPR24 | None |

Instead of leveraging matching-based solutions from 2D wireframes (or line segments) for 3D wireframe reconstruction as done in prior arts, we present NEAT, a rendering-distilling formulation using neural fields to represent 3D line segments with 2D observations, and bipartite matching for perceiving and distilling of a sparse set of 3D global junctions. The proposed {NEAT} enjoys the joint optimization of the neural fields and the global junctions from scratch, using view-dependent 2D observations without precomputed cross-view feature matching. Comprehensive experiments on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate our NEAT's superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives for 3D wireframe reconstruction. Moreover, the distilled 3D global junctions by NEAT, are a better initialization than SfM points, for the recently-emerged 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity novel view synthesis using about 20 times fewer initial 3D points.

Despite significant improvements on the quality of results, recent deep learning approaches are computationally expensive and power-hungry, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained edge devices. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a fast, accurate, and robust registration for low-cost embedded FPGAs. Based on a parallel and pipelined PointNet feature extractor, we develop custom accelerator cores namely PointLKCore and ReAgentCore, for two different learning-based methods. They are both correspondence-free and computationally efficient as they avoid the costly feature matching step involving nearest-neighbor search. The proposed cores are implemented on the Xilinx ZCU104 board and evaluated using both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing the substantial improvements in the trade-offs between runtime and registration quality. They run 44.08-45.75x faster than ARM Cortex-A53 CPU and offer 1.98-11.13x speedups over Intel Xeon CPU and Nvidia Jetson boards, while consuming less than 1W and achieving 163.11-213.58x energy-efficiency compared to Nvidia GeForce GPU. The proposed cores are more robust to noise and large initial misalignments than the classical methods and quickly find reasonable solutions in less than 15ms, demonstrating the real-time performance.</p></details> | 27 pages, 19 figures | None |
