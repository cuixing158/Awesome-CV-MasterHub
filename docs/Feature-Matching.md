| **[Initialize to Generalize: A Stronger Initialization Pipeline for Sparse-View 3DGS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17479v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints (regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i) frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points, compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii) point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a stronger initialization strategy.

On short videos, this compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ICIR 2025, camera-ready version</p></details> | None |
| **[ACE-G: Improving Generalization of Scene Coordinate Regression Through Query Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11605v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness while keeping the computational footprint attractive.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project page: https://nianticspatial.github.io/ace-g/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://nianticspatial.github.io/ace-g) |
| **[FusionGen: Feature Fusion-Based Few-Shot EEG Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10604v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings. To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10414v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks. Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper, we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset, self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate feature matching than the traditional method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MoRe: Monocular Geometry Refinement via Graph Optimization for Cross-View Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07119v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SegMASt3R: Geometry Grounded Segment Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05051v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180 degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal navigation.

| **[Visual Odometry with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03348v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SETR: A Two-Stage Semantic-Enhanced Framework for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26012v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1) union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues, carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SuperEvent: Cross-Modal Learning of Event-based Keypoint Detection for SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00139v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based keypoint detection and matching holds significant potential, enabling the integration of event sensors into highly optimized Visual SLAM systems developed for frame cameras over decades of research. Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

| **[Loc$^2$: Interpretable Cross-View Localization via Depth-Lifted Local Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09792v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an accurate and interpretable fine-grained cross-view localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose of a ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial image. Unlike prior approaches that rely on global descriptors or bird's-eye-view (BEV) transformations, our method directly learns ground-aerial image-plane correspondences using weak supervision from camera poses. The matched ground points are lifted into BEV space with monocular depth predictions, and scale-aware Procrustes alignment is then applied to estimate camera rotation, translation, and optionally the scale between relative depth and the aerial metric space. This formulation is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and requires no pixel-level annotations. Experiments show state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging scenarios such as cross-area testing and unknown orientation. Furthermore, our method offers strong interpretability: correspondence quality directly reflects localization accuracy and enables outlier rejection via RANSAC, while overlaying the re-scaled ground layout on the aerial image provides an intuitive visual cue of localization accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RPG360: Robust 360 Depth Estimation with Perspective Foundation Models and Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23991v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion 0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RestoRect: Degraded Image Restoration via Latent Rectified Flow & Feature Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23480v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose 'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection. RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aerial-Ground Image Feature Matching via 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Intermediate View Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19898v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in 3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based scene rendering.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VolSplat: Rethinking Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting with Voxel-Aligned Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19297v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in wider communities.

In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g., the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching, allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance. Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up to 63%. The dataset and code are available at: https://deepscenario.github.io/OrthoLoC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://deepscenario.github.io/OrthoLoC) |

While existing methods often rely on regression, feature matching, or registration techniques, achieving high precision and generalizability to unseen CAD models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation. The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates. These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, borrowing the idea from the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong intra-category generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and uncertainty estimation into a unified framework, enabling robust performance across a variety of real-world conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAMIR, an efficient registration framework via robust feature learning from SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13629v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function. However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings, enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  | None |

CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization, specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP, RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise and uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |

Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features. However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICVGIP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Fine-Grained Cross-View Localization via Local Feature Matching and Monocular Depth Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09792v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an accurate and highly interpretable fine-grained cross-view localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial image. Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye view (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for localization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due to perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby degrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method directly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts only the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably, modern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples are similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they still produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown scale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a scale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the correspondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera pose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves superior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as cross-area generalization and unknown orientation. Moreover, our method is compatible with various relative depth models without requiring per-model finetuning. This flexibility, combined with strong localization performance, makes it well-suited for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed method leverages learned features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch) datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios, scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch, highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.</p></details> |  | None |

While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from 16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals, anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER), 2025.

However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the practicality of our method in real-world manipulation.

However, its effectiveness is hampered when working with sparsely available views, often leading to performance dips due to overfitting. FreeNeRF attempts to overcome this limitation by integrating implicit geometry regularization, which incrementally improves both geometry and textures. Nonetheless, an initial low positional encoding bandwidth results in the exclusion of high-frequency elements. The quest for a holistic approach that simultaneously addresses overfitting and the preservation of high-frequency details remains ongoing. This study presents a novel feature-matching-based sparse geometry regularization module, enhanced by a spatially consistent geometry filtering mechanism and a frequency-guided geometric regularization strategy. This module excels at accurately identifying high-frequency keypoints, effectively preserving fine structural details. Through progressive refinement of geometry and textures across NeRF iterations, we unveil an effective few-shot neural rendering architecture, designated as SGCNeRF, for enhanced novel view synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that SGCNeRF not only achieves superior geometry-consistent outcomes but also surpasses FreeNeRF, with improvements of 0.7 dB in PSNR on LLFF and DTU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> | None |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

Aligning data from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera, Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer), and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT, AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting. The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Enhancing Image Retrieval with Efficient Local Search and Effective Global Re-ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04351v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local, stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost. Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

By abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process, and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates, while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in multi-step scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

The key to our approach lies in the explicitly modeled correspondence matching information, so as to provide the geometry prior to the prediction of NeRF color and density for volume rendering. The explicit correspondence matching is quantified with the cosine similarity between image features sampled at the 2D projections of a 3D point on different views, which is able to provide reliable cues about the surface geometry. Unlike previous methods where image features are extracted independently for each view, we consider modeling the cross-view interactions via Transformer cross-attention, which greatly improves the feature matching quality. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on different evaluation settings, with the experiments showing a strong correlation between our learned cosine feature similarity and volume density, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

Although several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain, most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns. Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks, outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%.

However, the presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both robustness and accuracy.</p></details> | 7 page, 2 figures | None |

However, existing approaches often struggle to capture fine-grained local deformations and large-scale global deformations simultaneously within a unified framework. We present FractMorph, a novel 3D dual-parallel transformer-based architecture that enhances cross-image feature matching through multi-domain fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) branches. Each Fractional Cross-Attention (FCA) block applies parallel FrFTs at fractional angles of 0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, along with a log-magnitude branch, to effectively extract local, semi-global, and global features at the same time. These features are fused via cross-attention between the fixed and moving image streams. A lightweight U-Net style network then predicts a dense deformation field from the transformer-enriched features. On the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset, FractMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.45%, an average per-structure DSC of 75.15%, and a 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 1.54 mm on our data split. We also introduce FractMorph-Light, a lightweight variant of our model with only 29.6M parameters, which maintains the superior accuracy of the main model while using approximately half the memory. Our results demonstrate that multi-domain spectral-spatial attention in transformers can robustly and efficiently model complex non-rigid deformations in medical images using a single end-to-end network, without the need for scenario-specific tuning or hierarchical multi-scale networks.

Physical triggers, which are natural objects embedded in real-world scenes, offer a promising alternative for attackers, as they can activate backdoors in real-time without digital manipulation. However, existing physical backdoor attacks are dirty-label, meaning that attackers must change the labels of poisoned inputs to the target label. The inconsistency between image content and label exposes the attack to human inspection, reducing its stealthiness in real-world settings. To address this limitation, we introduce Clean-Label Physical Backdoor Attack (CLPBA), a new paradigm of physical backdoor attack that does not require label manipulation and trigger injection at the training stage. Instead, the attacker injects imperceptible perturbations into a small number of target class samples to backdoor a model. By framing the attack as a Dataset Distillation problem, we develop three CLPBA variants -- Parameter Matching, Gradient Matching, and Feature Matching -- that craft effective poisons under both linear probing and full-finetuning training settings. In hard scenarios that require backdoor generalizability in the physical world, CLPBA is shown to even surpass Dirty-label attack baselines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLPBA via extensive experiments on two collected physical backdoor datasets for facial recognition and animal classification. The code is available in https://github.com/thinh-dao/Clean-Label-Physical-Backdoor-Attacks.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/thinh-dao/Clean-Label-Physical-Backdoor-Attacks) |

In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this, CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple vehicle configurations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |

Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes, distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion. Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset, achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

A necessary enabler to this capability is to find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods, such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates, whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Pr...</summary><p>in Proc. 75th Int.

We demonstrate that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style dimensions.

Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy. However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network (SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers: SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy (0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  | None |

The presence of multiple identical objects within a scene often leads to ambiguities for appearance-based feature matching algorithms. Our work circumvents this challenge by exclusively employing geometrical constraints, specifically epipolar geometry, for feature association. We introduce C-DOG (Connected delta-Overlap Graph), an algorithm designed for robust geometrical feature association, even in the presence of noisy feature detections. In a C-DOG graph, two nodes representing 2D feature points from distinct views are connected by an edge if they correspond to the same 3D point. Each edge is weighted by its epipolar distance. Ideally, true associations yield a zero distance; however, noisy feature detections can result in non-zero values. To robustly retain edges where the epipolar distance is less than a threshold delta, we employ a Szymkiewicz--Simpson coefficient. This process leads to a delta-neighbor-overlap clustering of 2D nodes. Furthermore, unreliable nodes are pruned from these clusters using an Inter-quartile Range (IQR)-based criterion. Our extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG not only outperforms geometry-based baseline algorithms but also remains remarkably robust under demanding conditions. This includes scenes with high object density, no visual features, and restricted camera overlap, positioning C-DOG as an excellent solution for scalable 3D reconstruction in practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching, exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps. Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds, attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching.

Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions, Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024 datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential, making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications.

This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion Attention for Remote Sensing Object Detection via Image Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19118v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase, one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems.

To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot, a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments.

| **[A Single-step Accurate Fingerprint Registration Method Based on Local Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16201v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently, fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense registration algorithms for further performance improvements.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://rookiexiong7.github.io/projects/SeC/; code: https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/SeC; dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenIXCLab/SeCVOS</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/SeC) |

Recent advances in visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore, we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments.

However, existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate and Advanced benchmarks.

Generalist prompted segmentation models like the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) can help tackle this task, but because they require image-specific visual prompts for effective performance, their use is limited to improving data annotation efficiency. Recent approaches extend SAM to automatic segmentation by using a few labeled reference images to predict point prompts; however, they rely on feature matching pipelines that lack robustness to out-of-domain data like surgical images. To tackle this problem, we introduce CycleSAM, an improved visual prompt learning approach that employs a data-efficient training phase and enforces a series of soft constraints to produce high-quality feature similarity maps. CycleSAM label-efficiently addresses domain gap by leveraging surgery-specific self-supervised feature extractors, then adapts the resulting features through a short parameter-efficient training stage, enabling it to produce informative similarity maps. CycleSAM further filters the similarity maps with a series of consistency constraints before robustly sampling diverse point prompts for each object instance. In our experiments on four diverse surgical datasets, we find that CycleSAM outperforms existing few-shot SAM approaches by a factor of 2-4x in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, while also achieving strong performance gains over traditional linear probing, parameter-efficient adaptation, and pseudo-labeling methods.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image. However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local \textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction, e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by +4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mind the Gap: Aligning Vision Foundation Models to Image Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10318v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment, we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to yield meaningful results.</p></details> |  | None |

A powerful approach to probe the limits of polynomial-time algorithms is to study the performance of low-degree polynomials. The seminal work of arXiv:2008.02269 connects low-degree lower bounds to multivariate cumulants. Prior works arXiv:2308.15728, arXiv:2506.13647 leverage independence among latent variables to bound cumulants. However, such approaches break down for problems with latent structure lacking independence, such as those involving random permutations. To address this important restriction, we develop a technique to upper-bound cumulants under weak dependencies, such as those arising from sampling without replacement or random permutations. To show-case the effectiveness of our approach, we uncover evidence of statistical-computational gaps in multiple feature matching and in seriation problems.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and compare it with the oracle approach.</p></details> | Preprint. ICUAS 2025 | None |

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</p></details> | Preprint | None |

Moreover, conventional feature encoders are typically trained on single-view 2D images, limiting their capacity to capture 3D-aware correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that lifts 2D images to 3D space, named as \textbf{Lift to Match (L2M)}, taking full advantage of large-scale and diverse single-view images. To be specific, in the first stage, we learn a 3D-aware feature encoder using a combination of multi-view image synthesis and 3D feature Gaussian representation, which injects 3D geometry knowledge into the encoder. In the second stage, a novel-view rendering strategy, combined with large-scale synthetic data generation from single-view images, is employed to learn a feature decoder for robust feature matching, thus achieving generalization across diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generalization across zero-shot evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robust feature matching.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16553v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulation (DNNCS) for spatiotemporal enhancement to efficiently learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNNCS learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To efficiently model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes. Their combination contributes to the overall 24% improvements in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). To train the proposed model, we propose a novel coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation. Our method shows superior downscaling quality and fast computation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures | None |

Image provenance analysis, which filters various query image variants and constructs a directed graph to trace their phylogeny history, has emerged as a critical solution. However, existing methods face two fundamental limitations: First, accuracy issues arise from overlooking heavily modified images due to low similarity while failing to exclude unrelated images and determine modification directions under diverse modification scenarios. Second, scalability bottlenecks stem from pairwise image analysis incurs quadratic complexity, hindering application in large-scale scenarios. This paper presents a scalable end-to-end pipeline for image provenance analysis that achieves high precision with linear complexity. This improves filtering effectiveness through modification relationship tracing, which enables the comprehensive discovery of image variants regardless of their visual similarity to the query. In addition, the proposed pipeline integrates local features matching and compression artifact capturing, enhancing robustness against diverse modifications and enabling accurate analysis of images' relationships. This allows the generation of a directed provenance graph that accurately characterizes the image's phylogeny history. Furthermore, by optimizing similarity calculations and eliminating redundant pairwise analysis during graph construction, the pipeline achieves a linear time complexity, ensuring its scalability for large-scale scenarios. Experiments demonstrate pipeline's superior performance, achieving a 16.7-56.1% accuracy improvement. Notably, it exhibits significant scalability with an average 3.0-second response time on 10 million scale images, which is far shorter than the SOTA approach's 12-minute duration.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Single-Frame Point-Pixel Registration via Supervised Cross-Modal Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22784v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception. A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings. Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically, these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability. Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g. MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability, we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds), despite using only single-frame LiDAR.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MatChA: Cross-Algorithm Matching with Feature Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22336v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods optimize a neural radiance field for each scene, relying heavily on dense training images and extensive computation resources. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce a new method called Efficient Depth-Guided Urban View Synthesis (EDUS) for fast feed-forward inference and efficient per-scene fine-tuning. Different from prior generalizable methods that infer geometry based on feature matching, EDUS leverages noisy predicted geometric priors as guidance to enable generalizable urban view synthesis from sparse input images. The geometric priors allow us to apply our generalizable model directly in the 3D space, gaining robustness across various sparsity levels. Through comprehensive experiments on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, we demonstrate promising generalization abilities on novel street scenes. Moreover, our results indicate that EDUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse view settings when combined with fast test-time optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024, Project page: https://xdimlab.github.io/EDUS/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xdimlab.github.io/EDUS) |

This capability is foundational in 3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments.

In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space, enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Feature Selection for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment by Mitigating Semantic Noise Sensitivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06158v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current state-of-the-art No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods typically rely on feature extraction from upstream semantic backbone networks, assuming that all extracted features are relevant. However, we make a key observation that not all features are beneficial, and some may even be harmful, necessitating careful selection. Empirically, we find that many image pairs with small feature spatial distances can have vastly different quality scores, indicating that the extracted features may contain a significant amount of quality-irrelevant noise. To address this issue, we propose a Quality-Aware Feature Matching IQA Metric (QFM-IQM) that employs an adversarial perspective to remove harmful semantic noise features from the upstream task. Specifically, QFM-IQM enhances the semantic noise distinguish capabilities by matching image pairs with similar quality scores but varying semantic features as adversarial semantic noise and adaptively adjusting the upstream task's features by reducing sensitivity to adversarial noise perturbation. Furthermore, we utilize a distillation framework to expand the dataset and improve the model's generalization ability. Our approach achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods on eight standard IQA datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In robotics, VPR is also referred to as Loop Closure Detection, which emphasizes spatial-temporal verification within a sequence. However, designing local features specifically for VPR is impractical, and relying on motion sequences imposes limitations. Inspired by these observations, we propose a novel, simple re-ranking method that refines global features through a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach under embodied constraints. First, we analyze the practical feasibility of embodied constraints in VPR and categorize them according to existing datasets, which include GPS tags, sequential timestamps, local feature matching, and self-similarity matrices. We then propose a learning-based MoF weight-computation approach, utilizing a multi-metric loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public datasets with minimal additional computational overhead. For instance, with only 25 KB of additional parameters and a processing time of 10 microseconds per frame, our method achieves a 0.9\% improvement over a DINOv2-based baseline performance on the Pitts-30k test set.</p></details> | 17 Pages | None |

The core idea involves matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution (LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges: inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and (3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to existing methods.

In this paper, we propose DM$^3$Net, a novel dual-camera super-resolution network based on Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching. To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[Aerial Multi-View Stereo via Adaptive Depth Range Inference and Normal Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05655v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational complexity.</p></details> | IEEE TGRS 2025 | None |

While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft Ver.

Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

However, accurate registration between these modalities remains a fundamental challenge due to the differences in dimensionality and anatomical representations. In this work, we present a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process: TRUS 3D reconstruction followed by cross-modal registration. Unlike existing TRUS 3D reconstruction methods that rely heavily on external probe tracking information, we propose a totally probe-location-independent approach that leverages the natural correlation between sagittal and transverse TRUS views. With the help of our clustering-based feature matching method, we enable the spatial localization of 2D frames without any additional probe tracking information. For the registration stage, we introduce an unsupervised diffusion-based framework guided by modality translation. Unlike existing methods that translate one modality into another, we map both MR and US into a pseudo intermediate modality. This design enables us to customize it to retain only registration-critical features, greatly easing registration. To further enhance anatomical alignment, we incorporate an anatomy-aware registration strategy that prioritizes internal structural coherence while adaptively reducing the influence of boundary inconsistencies. Extensive validation demonstrates that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior registration accuracy with physically realistic deformations in a completely unsupervised fashion.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this one-size-fits-all approach often overlooks the significant variations in learning difficulty among individual pixels and contextual regions. This paper investigates the uncertainty-based confidence maps which capture these spatially varying learning difficulties and introduces tailored solutions to address them. We first present the Difficulty Balancing (DB) loss, which utilizes an error-based confidence measure to encourage the network to focus more on challenging pixels and regions. Moreover, we identify that some difficult pixels and regions are affected by occlusions, resulting from the inherently ill-posed matching problem in the absence of real correspondences. To address this, we propose the Occlusion Avoiding (OA) loss, designed to guide the network into cycle consistency-based confident regions, where feature matching is more reliable. By combining the DB and OA losses, we effectively manage various types of challenging pixels and regions during training. Experiments on both optical flow and stereo depth tasks consistently demonstrate significant performance improvements when applying our proposed combination of the DB and OA losses.</p></details> | CVPRW2025 | None |

To generate high-quality try-on results, accurately warping the clothing item to fit the human body plays a significant role, as slight misalignment may lead to unrealistic artifacts in the fitting image. Most existing methods warp the clothing by feature matching and thin-plate spline (TPS). However, it often fails to preserve clothing details due to self-occlusion, severe misalignment between poses, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a detail retention virtual try-on method via accurate non-rigid registration (VITON-DRR) for diverse human poses. Specifically, we reconstruct a human semantic segmentation using a dual-pyramid-structured feature extractor. Then, a novel Deformation Module is designed for extracting the cloth key points and warping them through an accurate non-rigid registration algorithm. Finally, the Image Synthesis Module is designed to synthesize the deformed garment image and generate the human pose information adaptively. {Compared with} traditional methods, the proposed VITON-DRR can make the deformation of fitting images more accurate and retain more garment details.

A Machine Learning Study on Diabetes Risk Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22554v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diabetes risk prediction relies on identifying key features from complex health datasets, but conventional methods like mutual information (MI) filters and genetic algorithms (GAs) often overlook extreme dependencies critical for high-risk subpopulations. In this study we introduce a feature-selection framework using the upper-tail dependence coefficient ({\lambda}U) of the novel A2 copula, which quantifies how often extreme higher values of a predictor co-occur with diabetes diagnoses (target variable). Applied to the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (n=253,680), our method prioritizes five predictors (self-reported general health, high blood pressure, body mass index, mobility limitations, and high cholesterol levels) based on upper tail dependencies. These features match or outperform MI and GA selected subsets across four classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting), achieving accuracy up to 86.5% (XGBoost) and AUC up to 0.806 (Gradient Boosting), rivaling the full 21-feature model. Permutation importance confirms clinical relevance, with BMI and general health driving accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply a copula's upper-tail dependence for supervised feature selection, bridging extreme-value theory and machine learning to deliver a practical toolkit for diabetes prevention.</p></details> | Submitted | None |

The primary contribution of this study is a GPU data schedule algorithm for efficient feature matching of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The core idea is to divide the whole dataset into blocks based on the matrix band reduction (MBR) and achieve efficient feature matching via GPU-accelerated cascade hashing. First, match pairs are selected by using an image retrieval technique, which converts images into global descriptors and searches high-dimension nearest neighbors with graph indexing. Second, compact image blocks are iteratively generated from a MBR-based data schedule strategy, which exploits image connections to avoid redundant data IO (input/output) burden and increases the usage of GPU computing power. Third, guided by the generated image blocks, feature matching is executed sequentially within the framework of GPU-accelerated cascade hashing, and initial candidate matches are refined by combining a local geometric constraint and RANSAC-based global verification. For further performance improvement, these two seps are designed to execute parallelly in GPU and CPU. Finally, the performance of the proposed solution is evaluated by using large-scale UAV datasets. The results demonstrate that it increases the efficiency of feature matching with speedup ratios ranging from 77.0 to 100.0 compared with KD-Tree based matching methods, and achieves comparable accuracy in relative and absolute bundle adjustment (BA). The proposed algorithm is an efficient solution for feature matching of UAV images.</p></details> |  | None |

This requires mechanisms that can both identify semantically related objects across images and accurately produce segmentation masks. We note that Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), with its prompt-and-propagate mechanism, offers both strong segmentation capabilities and a built-in feature matching process. However, we show that its representations are entangled with task-specific cues optimized for object tracking, which impairs its use for tasks requiring higher level semantic understanding. Our key insight is that, despite its class-agnostic pretraining, SAM2 already encodes rich semantic structure in its features. We propose SANSA (Semantically AligNed Segment Anything 2), a framework that makes this latent structure explicit, and repurposes SAM2 for few-shot segmentation through minimal task-specific modifications. SANSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot segmentation benchmarks specifically designed to assess generalization, outperforms generalist methods in the popular in-context setting, supports various prompts flexible interaction via points, boxes, or scribbles, and remains significantly faster and more compact than prior approaches.

To this end, an innovative strategy-based hybrid framework HS-SLAM is proposed to integrate the advantages of direct and feature-based methods for fast computation without decreasing the performance. It first estimates the relative positions of consecutive frames using IMU pose estimation within the tracking thread. Then, it refines these estimates through a multi-layer direct method, which progressively corrects the relative pose from coarse to fine, ultimately achieving accurate corner-based feature matching. This approach serves as an alternative to the conventional constant-velocity tracking model. By selectively bypassing descriptor extraction for non-critical frames, HS-SLAM significantly improves the tracking speed. Experimental evaluations on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate that HS-SLAM achieves higher localization accuracies than ORB-SLAM3 while improving the average tracking efficiency by 15%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

Traditional silhouette- and pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that "what I cannot create, I do not understand", we turn to generative diffusion models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes, condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a two-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and cross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of gait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation termed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion features. Experiments on the CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both within- and cross-domain evaluations.

Classical vs Learned Image Matching for Mobile Mapping Cameras to Textured Semantic 3D Building Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17973v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion, and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions. Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual localization methods.

| **[Object-level Cross-view Geo-localization with Location Enhancement and Multi-Head Cross Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17911v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-view geo-localization determines the location of a query image, captured by a drone or ground-based camera, by matching it to a geo-referenced satellite image. While traditional approaches focus on image-level localization, many applications, such as search-and-rescue, infrastructure inspection, and precision delivery, demand object-level accuracy. This enables users to prompt a specific object with a single click on a drone image to retrieve precise geo-tagged information of the object. However, variations in viewpoints, timing, and imaging conditions pose significant challenges, especially when identifying visually similar objects in extensive satellite imagery. To address these challenges, we propose an Object-level Cross-view Geo-localization Network (OCGNet). It integrates user-specified click locations using Gaussian Kernel Transfer (GKT) to preserve location information throughout the network. This cue is dually embedded into the feature encoder and feature matching blocks, ensuring robust object-specific localization. Additionally, OCGNet incorporates a Location Enhancement (LE) module and a Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) module to adaptively emphasize object-specific features or expand focus to relevant contextual regions when necessary. OCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset, CVOGL. It also demonstrates few-shot learning capabilities, effectively generalizing from limited examples, making it suitable for diverse applications (https://github.com/ZheyangH/OCGNet).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ZheyangH/OCGNet) |

Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on descriptor similarity, GMatch performs a guided, incremental search, enforcing SE(3)-invariant geometric consistency throughout the matching process. It leverages a provably complete set of geometric features that uniquely determine 3D keypoint configurations, ensuring globally consistent correspondences without the need for training or GPU support. When combined with classical descriptors such as SIFT, GMatch-SIFT forms a general-purpose pose estimation pipeline that offers strong interpretability and generalization across diverse objects and scenes. Experiments on the HOPE dataset show that GMatch outperforms both traditional and learning-based matchers, with GMatch-SIFT achieving or surpassing the performance of instance-level pose networks. On the YCB-Video dataset, GMatch-SIFT demonstrates high accuracy and low variance on texture-rich objects. These results not only validate the effectiveness of GMatch-SIFT for object pose estimation but also highlight the broader applicability of GMatch as a general-purpose feature matcher.

| **[Non-planar Object Detection and Identification by Features Matching and Triangulation Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13769v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection and identification is surely a fundamental topic in the computer vision field; it plays a crucial role in many applications such as object tracking, industrial robots control, image retrieval, etc. We propose a feature-based approach for detecting and identifying distorted occurrences of a given template in a scene image by incremental grouping of feature matches between the image and the template. For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay triangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided in this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and, starting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the corresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are evaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the object in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold, thus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or when it is planar but appears distorted in the image. We show that our approach performs just as well or better than application of homography-based RANSAC in scenarios in which distortion is nearly absent, while when the deformation becomes relevant our method shows better description performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis at Politecnico di Milano</p></details> | None |
| **[OSMLoc: Single Image-Based Visual Localization in OpenStreetMap with Fused Geometric and Semantic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08665v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenStreetMap (OSM), a rich and versatile source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), facilitates human self-localization and scene understanding by integrating nearby visual observations with vectorized map data. However, the disparity in modalities and perspectives poses a major challenge for effectively matching camera imagery with compact map representations, thereby limiting the full potential of VGI data in real-world localization applications. Inspired by the fact that the human brain relies on the fusion of geometric and semantic understanding for spatial localization tasks, we propose the OSMLoc in this paper. OSMLoc is a brain-inspired visual localization approach based on first-person-view images against the OSM maps. It integrates semantic and geometric guidance to significantly improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational model to extract powerful image features. Second, a geometry-guided depth distribution adapter is proposed to bridge the monocular depth estimation and camera-to-BEV transform. Thirdly, the semantic embeddings from the OSM data are utilized as auxiliary guidance for image-to-OSM feature matching. To validate the proposed OSMLoc, we collect a worldwide cross-area and cross-condition (CC) benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments on the MGL dataset, CC validation benchmark, and KITTI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

| **[Geometry-Aware Feature Matching for Large-Scale Structure from Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02310v4)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Establishing consistent and dense correspondences across multiple images is crucial for Structure from Motion (SfM) systems. Significant view changes, such as air-to-ground with very sparse view overlap, pose an even greater challenge to the correspondence solvers. We present a novel optimization-based approach that significantly enhances existing feature matching methods by introducing geometry cues in addition to color cues. This helps fill gaps when there is less overlap in large-scale scenarios. Our method formulates geometric verification as an optimization problem, guiding feature matching within detector-free methods and using sparse correspondences from detector-based methods as anchor points. By enforcing geometric constraints via the Sampson Distance, our approach ensures that the denser correspondences from detector-free methods are geometrically consistent and more accurate. This hybrid strategy significantly improves correspondence density and accuracy, mitigates multi-view inconsistencies, and leads to notable advancements in camera pose accuracy and point cloud density. It outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on benchmark datasets and enables feature matching in challenging extreme large-scale settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Global-Local Feature Matching via Anomaly Synthesis for Multi-Class Point Cloud Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07375v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud anomaly detection is essential for various industrial applications. The huge computation and storage costs caused by the increasing product classes limit the application of single-class unsupervised methods, necessitating the development of multi-class unsupervised methods. However, the feature similarity between normal and anomalous points from different class data leads to the feature confusion problem, which greatly hinders the performance of multi-class methods. Therefore, we introduce a multi-class point cloud anomaly detection method, named GLFM, leveraging global-local feature matching to progressively separate data that are prone to confusion across multiple classes. Specifically, GLFM is structured into three stages: Stage-I proposes an anomaly synthesis pipeline that stretches point clouds to create abundant anomaly data that are utilized to adapt the point cloud feature extractor for better feature representation. Stage-II establishes the global and local memory banks according to the global and local feature distributions of all the training data, weakening the impact of feature confusion on the establishment of the memory bank. Stage-III implements anomaly detection of test data leveraging its feature distance from global and local memory banks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD, Real3D-AD and actual industry parts dataset showcase our proposed GLFM's superior point cloud anomaly detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/hustCYQ/GLFM-Multi-class-3DAD.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/hustCYQ/GLFM-Multi-class-3DAD) |
| **[Boosting Neural Language Inference via Cascaded Interactive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06607v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on ascertaining the logical relationship (entailment, contradiction, or neutral) between a given premise and hypothesis. This task presents significant challenges due to inherent linguistic features such as diverse phrasing, semantic complexity, and contextual nuances. While Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) built upon the Transformer architecture have yielded substantial advancements in NLI, prevailing methods predominantly utilize representations from the terminal layer. This reliance on final-layer outputs may overlook valuable information encoded in intermediate layers, potentially limiting the capacity to model intricate semantic interactions effectively. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Cascaded Interactive Reasoning Network (CIRN), a novel architecture designed for deeper semantic comprehension in NLI. CIRN implements a hierarchical feature extraction strategy across multiple network depths, operating within an interactive space where cross-sentence information is continuously integrated. This mechanism aims to mimic a process of progressive reasoning, transitioning from surface-level feature matching to uncovering more profound logical and semantic connections between the premise and hypothesis. By systematically mining latent semantic relationships at various representational levels, CIRN facilitates a more thorough understanding of the input pair. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on several standard NLI benchmark datasets reveal consistent performance gains achieved by CIRN over competitive baseline approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-level interactive features for complex relational reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called \textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Focus What Matters: Matchability-Based Reweighting for Local Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02161v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the rise of Transformers, many semi-dense matching methods have adopted attention mechanisms to extract feature descriptors. However, the attention weights, which capture dependencies between pixels or keypoints, are often learned from scratch. This approach can introduce redundancy and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions, as it treats all pixels or keypoints equally. Drawing inspiration from keypoint selection processes, we propose to first classify all pixels into two categories: matchable and non-matchable. Matchable pixels are expected to receive higher attention weights, while non-matchable ones are down-weighted. In this work, we propose a novel attention reweighting mechanism that simultaneously incorporates a learnable bias term into the attention logits and applies a matchability-informed rescaling to the input value features. The bias term, injected prior to the softmax operation, selectively adjusts attention scores based on the confidence of query-key interactions. Concurrently, the feature rescaling acts post-attention by modulating the influence of each value vector in the final output. This dual design allows the attention mechanism to dynamically adjust both its internal weighting scheme and the magnitude of its output representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unaligned RGB Guided Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Spatial-Spectral Concordance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02109v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images super-resolution aims to improve the spatial resolution, yet its performance is often limited at high-resolution ratios. The recent adoption of high-resolution reference images for super-resolution is driven by the poor spatial detail found in low-resolution HSIs, presenting it as a favorable method. However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize information from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and its inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution (SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the issues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous approaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images more accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a Two-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image alignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more accurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged textures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and fusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we propose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the feature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature Aggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture aggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively generating learnable offset. Besides, we introduce two basic spectral-wise attention blocks in the attention fusion module to model the inter-spectra interactions. Extensive experiments on three natural or remote-sensing datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that enables small object representations to "borrow" discriminative features from larger, semantically richer instances within the same class. Our architecture introduces three key components: the Feature Matching Block (FMB) to identify semantically similar descriptors across layers, the Feature Representing Block (FRB) to generate enhanced shallow features through weighted aggregation, and the Feature Fusion Block (FFB) to refine feature maps by integrating original, borrowed, and context information. Built upon the SSD framework, our method improves the descriptive capacity of shallow layers while maintaining real-time detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts small object detection accuracy over baseline methods, offering a promising direction for robust object detection in complex visual environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Among these, marine snow, which is suspended organic particles appearing as bright spots or noise, significantly impacts machine vision tasks, particularly those involving feature matching. Existing methods for removing marine snow are ineffective due to the lack of paired training data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel enhancement framework that introduces a new approach for generating paired datasets from raw underwater videos. The resulting dataset consists of paired images of generated snowy and snow, free underwater videos, enabling supervised training for video enhancement. We describe the dataset creation process, highlight its key characteristics, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing underwater image restoration in the absence of ground truth.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurately determining distortion parameters typically requires either 1) solving the full Structure from Motion (SfM) problem involving camera poses, 3D points, and the distortion parameters, which is only possible if many images with sufficient overlap are provided, or 2) relying heavily on learning-based methods that are comparatively less accurate. In this work, we demonstrate that distortion calibration can be decoupled from 3D reconstruction, maintaining the accuracy of SfM-based methods while avoiding many of the associated complexities. This is achieved by working in Projective Space, where the geometry is unique up to a homography, which encapsulates all camera parameters except for distortion. Our proposed method, Projective Radial Distortion Averaging, averages multiple distortion estimates in a fully projective framework without creating 3d points and full bundle adjustment. By relying on pairwise projective relations, our methods support any feature-matching approaches without constructing point tracks across multiple images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025. 8 pages + references</p></details> | None |

Traditionally, IRL is treated as an adversarial game, where an adversary searches over reward models, and a learner optimizes the reward through repeated RL procedures. This game-solving approach is both computationally expensive and difficult to stabilize. In this work, we propose a novel approach to IRL by direct policy optimization: exploiting a linear factorization of the return as the inner product of successor features and a reward vector, we design an IRL algorithm by policy gradient descent on the gap between the learner and expert features. Our non-adversarial method does not require learning a reward function and can be solved seamlessly with existing actor-critic RL algorithms. Remarkably, our approach works in state-only settings without expert action labels, a setting which behavior cloning (BC) cannot solve. Empirical results demonstrate that our method learns from as few as a single expert demonstration and achieves improved performance on various control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor employs semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated image. Additionally, our framework incorporates a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve geometry priors of reference subjects for robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest in robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While traditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down when faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning methods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain constrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational demands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves beyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively. Instead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion signatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal motion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve natural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while remaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also requires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature detection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence enables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing approaches typically employ multi-modal foundation models combining language and vision modalities for prompt-guided anomaly detection, these methods often demand sophisticated prompt engineering and extensive manual tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate that a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD scenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential components: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and discriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support augmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to address the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature integration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency local details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual memory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection. Extensive evaluations across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD benchmarks demonstrate VisionAD's exceptional performance. Using only 1 normal images as support, our method achieves remarkable image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8% respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins (+1.6%, +3.2%, and +1.4%).

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.

We observe that the pairwise matching paradigms applied to image set matching often result in ambiguous estimation when the selected independent pairs exhibit significant occlusions or extreme viewpoint changes. This challenge primarily stems from the inherent uncertainty in interpreting intricate 3D structures based on limited two-view observations, as the 3D-to-2D projection leads to significant information loss. To address this, we introduce CoMatcher, a deep multi-view matcher to (i) leverage complementary context cues from different views to form a holistic 3D scene understanding and (ii) utilize cross-view projection consistency to infer a reliable global solution. Building on CoMatcher, we develop a groupwise framework that fully exploits cross-view relationships for large-scale matching tasks.

Existing works have shown that vanilla visual networks are biased toward learning appearance information, \eg texture, to recognize objects. This implicit bias causes the model to fail in detecting novel objects with unseen textures in the open-world setting. To address this challenge, we propose a learning framework, called view-Consistent LeaRning (v-CLR), which aims to enforce the model to learn appearance-invariant representations for robust instance segmentation. In v-CLR, we first introduce additional views for each image, where the texture undergoes significant alterations while preserving the image's underlying structure. We then encourage the model to learn the appearance-invariant representation by enforcing the consistency between object features across different views, for which we obtain class-agnostic object proposals using off-the-shelf unsupervised models that possess strong object-awareness. These proposals enable cross-view object feature matching, greatly reducing the appearance dependency while enhancing the object-awareness. We thoroughly evaluate our method on public benchmarks under both cross-class and cross-dataset settings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |

The proposed method enables high-quality rendering from single-view input. Unlike prior Gaussian Splatting methods that primarily focus on geometry refinement, we emphasize the importance of joint optimization of image and depth features for accurate Gaussian prediction. To this end, we first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality, formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature matching strategy coupled with a multi-scale Gaussian decoding model to enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning.

Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, NNFM loss does not consider global style information. In addition, the implicit representation of NeRF limits their fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms. Extensive experiments show that our ABC-GS provides controllability of style transfer and achieves stylization results that are more faithfully aligned with the global style of the chosen artistic reference.

Technically, it requires proposal detection to identify all possible object instances, followed by instance-level matching to pinpoint the ones of interest. Its open-world nature supports its broad applications from robotics to AR/VR but also presents significant challenges: methods must generalize to unknown testing data distributions because (1) the testing scene imagery is unseen during training, and (2) there are domain gaps between visual references and detected proposals. Existing methods tackle these challenges by synthesizing diverse training examples or utilizing off-the-shelf foundation models (FMs). However, they only partially capitalize the available open-world information. In contrast, we approach InsDet from an Open-World perspective, introducing our method IDOW. We find that, while pretrained FMs yield high recall in instance detection, they are not specifically optimized for instance-level feature matching. Therefore, we adapt pretrained FMs for improved instance-level matching using open-world data. Our approach incorporates metric learning along with novel data augmentations, which sample distractors as negative examples and synthesize novel-view instances to enrich the visual references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior works, achieving >10 AP over previous results on two recently released challenging benchmark datasets in both conventional and novel instance detection settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[AgRowStitch: A High-fidelity Image Stitching Pipeline for Ground-based Agricultural Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21990v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural imaging often requires individual images to be stitched together into a final mosaic for analysis. However, agricultural images can be particularly challenging to stitch because feature matching across images is difficult due to repeated textures, plants are non-planar, and mosaics built from many images can accumulate errors that cause drift. Although these issues can be mitigated by using georeferenced images or taking images at high altitude, there is no general solution for images taken close to the crop. To address this, we created a user-friendly and open source pipeline for stitching ground-based images of a linear row of crops that does not rely on additional data. First, we use SuperPoint and LightGlue to extract and match features within small batches of images. Then we stitch the images in each batch in series while imposing constraints on the camera movement. After straightening and rescaling each batch mosaic, all batch mosaics are stitched together in series and then straightened into a final mosaic. We tested the pipeline on images collected along 72 m long rows of crops using two different agricultural robots and a camera manually carried over the row. In all three cases, the pipeline produced high-quality mosaics that could be used to georeference real world positions with a mean absolute error of 20 cm. This approach provides accessible leaf-scale stitching to users who need to coarsely georeference positions within a row, but do not have access to accurate positional data or sophisticated imaging systems.</p></details> |  | None |

The key insight of our methods is to establish implicit-semantic area matching prior to point matching, based on advanced image understanding of SAM. Then, informative area matches with consistent internal semantic are able to undergo dense feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching. Specifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework and first obtains candidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). Then, area matching among the candidates is formulated as graph energy minimization and solved by graphical models derived from AG. To address the efficiency issue of MESA, we further propose DMESA as its dense counterpart, applying a dense matching framework. After candidate areas are identified by AG, DMESA establishes area matches through generating dense matching distributions. The distributions are produced from off-the-shelf patch matching utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model and refined via the Expectation Maximization. With less repetitive computation, DMESA showcases a speed improvement of nearly five times compared to MESA, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our methods are extensively evaluated on five datasets encompassing indoor and outdoor scenes. The results illustrate consistent performance improvements from our methods for five distinct point matching baselines across all datasets. Furthermore, our methods exhibit promise generalization and improved robustness against image resolution variations.

This paper focuses on rotation symmetry, where objects remain unchanged when rotated around a central axis, requiring detection of rotation centers and supporting vertices. Traditional methods relied on hand-crafted feature matching, while recent segmentation models based on convolutional neural networks detect rotation centers but struggle with 3D geometric consistency due to viewpoint distortions. To overcome this, we propose a model that directly predicts rotation centers and vertices in 3D space and projects the results back to 2D while preserving structural integrity. By incorporating a vertex reconstruction stage enforcing 3D geometric priors -- such as equal side lengths and interior angles -- our model enhances robustness and accuracy. Experiments on the DENDI dataset show superior performance in rotation axis detection and validate the impact of 3D priors through ablation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

While image diffusion models have shown remarkable restoration capabilities, their direct application to video leads to temporal inconsistencies, and existing video restoration methods require extensive retraining for different degradation types. Our approach addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a hierarchical latent warping strategy that maintains consistency across both keyframes and local frames, and a hybrid token merging mechanism that adaptively combines optical flow and feature matching. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains the high-quality restoration of base diffusion models but also achieves superior temporal consistency across diverse datasets and degradation conditions, including challenging scenarios like 8$\times$ super-resolution and severe noise. Importantly, our framework works with any image restoration diffusion model, providing a versatile solution for video enhancement without task-specific training or modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jimmycv07.github.io/DiffIR2VR_web/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jimmycv07.github.io/DiffIR2VR_web) |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

Based on this scene representation, we introduce a novel matching-oriented Gaussian sampling strategy and a scene-specific detector to achieve efficient and robust initial pose estimation. Furthermore, based on the initial localization results, we align the query feature map to the Gaussian feature field by dense feature matching to enable accurate localization. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that STDLoc outperforms current state-of-the-art localization methods in terms of localization accuracy and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP.

The pose is estimated by aligning a point plane generated from the ground image with a point plane sampled from the aerial image. To generate the ground points, we first map ground image features to a 3D point cloud. Our method then learns to select features along the height dimension to pool the 3D points to a Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) plane. This selection enables us to trace which feature in the ground image contributes to the BEV representation. Next, we sample a set of sparse matches from computed point correspondences between the two point planes and compute their relative pose using Procrustes alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, our method reduces the mean localization error by 28% on the VIGOR cross-area test set. Qualitative results show that our method learns semantically consistent matches across ground and aerial views through weakly supervised learning from the camera pose.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning for Relative Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18671v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relative pose estimation provides a promising way for achieving object-agnostic pose estimation. Despite the success of existing 3D correspondence-based methods, the reliance on explicit feature matching suffers from small overlaps in visible regions and unreliable feature estimation for invisible regions. Inspired by humans' ability to assemble two object parts that have small or no overlapping regions by considering object structure, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning method for Relative Pose Estimation, which consists of two key modules. First, a structure-aware keypoint extraction module is designed to locate a set of kepoints that can represent the structure of objects with different shapes and appearance, under the guidance of a keypoint based image reconstruction loss. Second, a structure-aware correspondence estimation module is designed to model the intra-image and inter-image relationships between keypoints to extract structure-aware features for correspondence estimation. By jointly leveraging these two modules, the proposed method can naturally estimate 3D-3D correspondences for unseen objects without explicit feature matching for precise relative pose estimation. Experimental results on the CO3D, Objaverse and LineMOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods, i.e., with 5.7{\deg}reduction in mean angular error on the CO3D dataset.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization. These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multi-view stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised optimization method with zero-knowledge priors, using direction-based enhancement to ensure multi-view consistency.

To efficiently address GPR signal noise, we introduce an advanced feature representation called the subsurface feature matrix (SFM). The SFM leverages frequency domain data and identifies peaks within radar scans. Additionally, we propose a novel feature matching method that estimates GPR displacement by aligning SFMs. The integrations from these three input sources are consolidated using a factor graph approach to achieve multimodal robot odometry.

These approaches ultimately aim to attain test accuracy levels akin to those achieved by models trained on the entirety of the original dataset. Previous studies in feature and distribution matching have achieved significant results without incurring the costs of bi-level optimization in the distillation process. Despite their convincing efficiency, many of these methods suffer from marginal downstream performance improvements, limited distillation of contextual information, and subpar cross-architecture generalization. To address these challenges in dataset distillation, we propose the ATtentiOn Mixer (ATOM) module to efficiently distill large datasets using a mixture of channel and spatial-wise attention in the feature matching process. Spatial-wise attention helps guide the learning process based on consistent localization of classes in their respective images, allowing for distillation from a broader receptive field. Meanwhile, channel-wise attention captures the contextual information associated with the class itself, thus making the synthetic image more informative for training. By integrating both types of attention, our ATOM module demonstrates superior performance across various computer vision datasets, including CIFAR10/100 and TinyImagenet. Notably, our method significantly improves performance in scenarios with a low number of images per class, thereby enhancing its potential. Furthermore, we maintain the improvement in cross-architectures and applications such as neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for an oral presentation in CVPR-DD 2024</p></details> | None |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP).

While state-of-the art methods that relies on feature matching have proven to be accurate for visual localization, its requirements for storage and compute are burdens. Scene coordinate regression (SCR) is an alternative approach that remove the barrier for storage by learning to map 2D pixels to 3D scene coordinates. Most popular SCR use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract 2D descriptor, which we would argue that it miss the spatial relationship between pixels. Inspired by the success of vision transformer architecture, we present a new SCR architecture, called A-ScoRe, an Attention-based model which leverage attention on descriptor map level to produce meaningful and high-semantic 2D descriptors. Since the operation is performed on descriptor map, our model can work with multiple data modality whether it is a dense or sparse from depth-map, SLAM to Structure-from-Motion (SfM). This versatility allows A-SCoRe to operate in different kind of environments, conditions and achieve the level of flexibility that is important for mobile robots. Results show our methods achieve comparable performance with State-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark while being light-weighted and much more flexible.

In this paper, we introduce InstantSplat, a novel approach for addressing sparse-view 3D scene reconstruction at lightning-fast speed. InstantSplat employs a self-supervised framework that optimizes 3D scene representation and camera poses by unprojecting 2D pixels into 3D space and aligning them using differentiable neural rendering. The optimization process is initialized with a large-scale trained geometric foundation model, which provides dense priors that yield initial points through model inference, after which we further optimize all scene parameters using photometric errors. To mitigate redundancy introduced by the prior model, we propose a co-visibility-based geometry initialization, and a Gaussian-based bundle adjustment is employed to rapidly adapt both the scene representation and camera parameters without relying on a complex adaptive density control process. Overall, InstantSplat is compatible with multiple point-based representations for view synthesis and surface reconstruction. It achieves an acceleration of over 30x in reconstruction and improves visual quality (SSIM) from 0.3755 to 0.7624 compared to traditional SfM with 3D-GS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://instantsplat.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Compared to classical feature matching, point tracking methods have the key advantage of robustly tracking points under complex camera motion trajectories and over extended periods. However, despite certain improvements in methodologies, current point tracking methods still struggle to track any position in video frames, especially in areas that are texture-less or weakly textured. In this work, we first introduce metrics for evaluating the texture intensity of a 3D object. Using these metrics, we classify the 3D models in ShapeNet into three levels of texture intensity and create GIFT, a challenging synthetic benchmark comprising 1800 indoor video sequences with rich annotations. Unlike existing datasets that assign ground truth points arbitrarily, GIFT precisely anchors ground truth on classified target objects, ensuring that each video corresponds to a specific texture intensity level. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate current methods on GIFT to assess their performance across different texture intensity levels and analyze the impact of texture on point tracking.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection and Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07601v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study.

However, when handling complex kitting tasks that involve fine-grained orientation alignment, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Histogram Transporter, a novel kitting framework that learns high-precision pick-and-place actions from scratch using only a few demonstrations. First, our method extracts rotation-equivariant orientation histograms (EOHs) from visual observations using an efficient Fourier-based discretization strategy. These EOHs serve a dual purpose: improving picking efficiency by directly modeling action success probabilities over high-resolution orientations and enhancing placing accuracy by serving as local, discriminative feature descriptors for object-to-placement matching. Second, we introduce a subgroup alignment strategy in the place model that compresses the full spectrum of EOHs into a compact orientation representation, enabling efficient feature matching while preserving accuracy. Finally, we examine the proposed framework on the simulated Hand-Tool Kitting Dataset (HTKD), where it outperforms competitive baselines in both success rates and computational efficiency. Further experiments on five Raven-10 tasks exhibits the remarkable adaptability of our approach, with real-robot trials confirming its applicability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review</p></details> | None |
| **[Aligning First, Then Fusing: A Novel Weakly Supervised Multimodal Violence Detection Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07496v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised violence detection refers to the technique of training models to identify violent segments in videos using only video-level labels. Among these approaches, multimodal violence detection, which integrates modalities such as audio and optical flow, holds great potential. Existing methods in this domain primarily focus on designing multimodal fusion models to address modality discrepancies. In contrast, we take a different approach; leveraging the inherent discrepancies across modalities in violence event representation to propose a novel multimodal semantic feature alignment method. This method sparsely maps the semantic features of local, transient, and less informative modalities ( such as audio and optical flow ) into the more informative RGB semantic feature space. Through an iterative process, the method identifies the suitable no-zero feature matching subspace and aligns the modality-specific event representations based on this subspace, enabling the full exploitation of information from all modalities during the subsequent modality fusion stage. Building on this, we design a new weakly supervised violence detection framework that consists of unimodal multiple-instance learning for extracting unimodal semantic features, multimodal alignment, multimodal fusion, and final detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an average precision (AP) of 86.07% on the XD-Violence dataset.

Existing learning-based RANSAC methods utilize deep learning to enhance the robustness of RANSAC against outliers. However, these approaches are trained and tested on the data generated by the same algorithms, leading to limited generalization to out-of-distribution data during inference. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based paradigm that progressively injects noise into ground-truth data, simulating the noisy conditions for training learning-based RANSAC. To enhance data diversity, we incorporate Monte Carlo sampling into the diffusion paradigm, approximating diverse data distributions by introducing different types of randomness at multiple stages. We evaluate our approach in the context of feature matching through comprehensive experiments on the ScanNet and MegaDepth datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our Monte Carlo diffusion mechanism significantly improves the generalization ability of learning-based RANSAC. We also develop extensive ablation studies that highlight the effectiveness of key components in our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Visual feature matching is crucial to vision-based pipelines but remains particularly challenging in natural outdoor settings due to perceptual aliasing. We address this issue in vineyards, where repetitive vine trunks and other natural elements generate ambiguous descriptors that hinder reliable feature matching. We hypothesise that semantic information tied to keypoint positions can alleviate perceptual aliasing by enhancing keypoint descriptor distinctiveness. To this end, we introduce a keypoint semantic integration technique that improves the descriptors in semantically meaningful regions within the image, enabling more accurate differentiation even among visually similar local features. We validate this approach in two vineyard perception tasks: (i) relative pose estimation and (ii) visual localisation. Across all tested keypoint types and descriptors, our method improves matching accuracy by 12.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness over multiple months in challenging vineyard conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/LCAS/GAIA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/LCAS/GAIA) |
| **[Keypoint Detection and Description for Raw Bayer Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08673v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keypoint detection and local feature description are fundamental tasks in robotic perception, critical for applications such as SLAM, robot localization, feature matching, pose estimation, and 3D mapping. While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature Alignment with Equivariant Convolutions for Burst Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08300v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Burst image processing (BIP), which captures and integrates multiple frames into a single high-quality image, is widely used in consumer cameras. As a typical BIP task, Burst Image Super-Resolution (BISR) has achieved notable progress through deep learning in recent years. Existing BISR methods typically involve three key stages: alignment, upsampling, and fusion, often in varying orders and implementations. Among these stages, alignment is particularly critical for ensuring accurate feature matching and further reconstruction. However, existing methods often rely on techniques such as deformable convolutions and optical flow to realize alignment, which either focus only on local transformations or lack theoretical grounding, thereby limiting their performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework for BISR, featuring an equivariant convolution-based alignment, ensuring consistent transformations between the image and feature domains. This enables the alignment transformation to be learned via explicit supervision in the image domain and easily applied in the feature domain in a theoretically sound way, effectively improving alignment accuracy. Additionally, we design an effective reconstruction module with advanced deep architectures for upsampling and fusion to obtain the final BISR result. Extensive experiments on BISR benchmarks show the superior performance of our approach in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing topological segmentation loss functions are primarily based on the persistent homology of the image. They match the persistent features from the segmentation with the persistent features from the ground truth and minimize the difference between them. However, these methods suffer from an ambiguous matching problem since the matching only relies on the information in the topological space. In this work, we propose an effective and efficient Spatial-Aware Topological Loss Function that further leverages the information in the original spatial domain of the image to assist the matching of persistent features. Extensive experiments on images of various types of tubular structures show that the proposed method has superior performance in improving the topological accuracy of the segmentation compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[NeuraLoc: Visual Localization in Neural Implicit Map with Dual Complementary Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06117v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, neural radiance fields (NeRF) have gained significant attention in the field of visual localization. However, existing NeRF-based approaches either lack geometric constraints or require extensive storage for feature matching, limiting their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and novel visual localization approach based on the neural implicit map with complementary features. Specifically, to enforce geometric constraints and reduce storage requirements, we implicitly learn a 3D keypoint descriptor field, avoiding the need to explicitly store point-wise features. To further address the semantic ambiguity of descriptors, we introduce additional semantic contextual feature fields, which enhance the quality and reliability of 2D-3D correspondences. Besides, we propose descriptor similarity distribution alignment to minimize the domain gap between 2D and 3D feature spaces during matching. Finally, we construct the matching graph using both complementary descriptors and contextual features to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondences for 6-DoF pose estimation. Compared with the recent NeRF-based approaches, our method achieves a 3$\times$ faster training speed and a 45$\times$ reduction in model storage. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art NeRF-based visual localization methods.

In this paper, we revisit the mainstream detector-free matching pipeline and improve all its stages considering both accuracy and efficiency. We propose an Efficient Deep feature Matching network, EDM. We first adopt a deeper CNN with fewer dimensions to extract multi-level features. Then we present a Correlation Injection Module that conducts feature transformation on high-level deep features, and progressively injects feature correlations from global to local for efficient multi-scale feature aggregation, improving both speed and performance. In the refinement stage, a novel lightweight bidirectional axis-based regression head is designed to directly predict subpixel-level correspondences from latent features, avoiding the significant computational cost of explicitly locating keypoints on high-resolution local feature heatmaps. Moreover, effective selection strategies are introduced to enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our EDM achieves competitive matching accuracy on various benchmarks and exhibits excellent efficiency, offering valuable best practices for real-world applications.

Precise pose estimation is an important task for mobile robots exploring planetary surfaces, as they operate in GPS-denied environments. Although visual odometry provides accurate localization, it is computationally expensive and can fail in dim or high-contrast lighting. Wheel encoders can also provide odometry estimation, but are prone to slipping on the sandy terrain encountered on Mars. Although traditionally a scientific surveying sensor, GPR has been used on Earth for terrain classification and localization through subsurface feature matching. The Perseverance rover and the upcoming ExoMars rover have GPR sensors already equipped to aid in the search of water and mineral resources. We propose to leverage GPR to aid in Mars rover localization. Specifically, we develop a novel GPR-based deep learning model that predicts 1D relative pose translation. We fuse our GPR pose prediction method with inertial and wheel encoder data in a filtering framework to output rover localization. We perform experiments in a Mars analog environment and demonstrate that our GPR-based displacement predictions both outperform wheel encoders and improve multi-modal filtering estimates in high-slip environments. Lastly, we present the first dataset aimed at GPR-based localization in Mars analog environments, which will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |

Striking a better balance between performance and efficiency remains a challenge in feature matching. Inspired by the linear complexity O(N) of Mamba, we propose an ultra-lightweight Mamba-based matcher, named JamMa, which converges on a single GPU and achieves an impressive performance-efficiency balance in inference. To unlock the potential of Mamba for feature matching, we propose Joint Mamba with a scan-merge strategy named JEGO, which enables: (1) Joint scan of two images to achieve high-frequency mutual interaction, (2) Efficient scan with skip steps to reduce sequence length, (3) Global receptive field, and (4) Omnidirectional feature representation. With the above properties, the JEGO strategy significantly outperforms the scan-merge strategies proposed in VMamba and EVMamba in the feature matching task.

A multi-sensor UAV system, integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera, can provide an effective solution to this problem. In this paper, we utilize multi-sensor data to overcome the limitations of conventional orthoimage generation methods in terms of temporal performance, system robustness, and geographic reference accuracy. A prior-pose-optimized feature matching method is introduced to enhance matching speed and accuracy, reducing the number of required features and providing precise references for the Structure from Motion (SfM) process. The proposed method exhibits robustness in low-texture scenes like farmlands, where feature matching is difficult.

While increasing $k$ improves localisation robustness, it also linearly increases computational cost and runtime, creating a significant bottleneck. This paper investigates the relationship between global and local descriptors, showing that greater similarity between the global descriptors of query and database images increases the proportion of feature matches. Low similarity queries significantly benefit from increasing $k$, while high similarity queries rapidly experience diminishing returns. Building on these observations, we propose an adaptive strategy that adjusts $k$ based on the similarity between the query's global descriptor and those in the database, effectively mitigating the feature-matching bottleneck. Our approach optimizes processing time without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on three indoor and outdoor datasets show that AIR-HLoc reduces feature matching time by up to 30\%, while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy.

Existing approaches typically model unordered matches as a consistency graph and sample consistent matches to generate hypotheses. However, explicit graph construction introduces noise, posing great challenges for handcrafted geometric constraints to render consistency among matches. To overcome this, we propose HyperGCT, a flexible dynamic Hyper-GNN-learned geometric constraint that leverages high-order consistency among 3D correspondences. To our knowledge, HyperGCT is the first method that mines robust geometric constraints from dynamic hypergraphs for 3D registration. By dynamically optimizing the hypergraph through vertex and edge feature aggregation, HyperGCT effectively captures the correlations among correspondences, leading to accurate hypothesis generation. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, KITTI-LC, and ETH show that HyperGCT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our method is robust to graph noise, demonstrating a significant advantage in terms of generalization. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

This can result in an infinite number of variations in palm vein images for a given individual. This paper introduces a novel filtering technique for SIFT-based feature matching, known as the Mean and Median Distance (MMD) Filter. This method evaluates the differences in keypoint coordinates and computes the mean and median in each direction to eliminate incorrect matches. Experiments conducted on the 850nm subset of the CASIA dataset indicate that the proposed MMD filter effectively preserves correct points while reducing false positives detected by other filtering methods.

Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been used to extract interpretable features from individual layers, aligning these features across layers has remained an open problem. In this paper, we introduce SAE Match, a novel, data-free method for aligning SAE features across different layers of a neural network. Our approach involves matching features by minimizing the mean squared error between the folded parameters of SAEs, a technique that incorporates activation thresholds into the encoder and decoder weights to account for differences in feature scales. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma 2 language model, we demonstrate that our method effectively captures feature evolution across layers, improving feature matching quality. We also show that features persist over several layers and that our approach can approximate hidden states across layers. Our work advances the understanding of feature dynamics in neural networks and provides a new tool for mechanistic interpretability studies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, keypoint detection or matching tends to fail in challenging scenarios with inconsistent illuminations or textureless objects, resulting significant performance degradation. Previous approaches, including our proposed Correspondence encoded Neural image Servo policy (CNS), attempted to alleviate these issues by integrating neural control strategies. While CNS shows certain improvement against error correspondence over conventional image-based controllers, it could not fully resolve the limitations arising from poor keypoint detection and matching. In this paper, we continue to address this problem and propose a new solution: Probabilistic Correspondence Encoded Neural Image Servo (CNSv2). CNSv2 leverages probabilistic feature matching to improve robustness in challenging scenarios. By redesigning the architecture to condition on multimodal feature matching, CNSv2 achieves high precision, improved robustness across diverse scenes and runs in real-time. We validate CNSv2 with simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of detector-based methods in visual servo tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods typically rely on feature matching (FM) with stored descriptors or use a single network to encode both points and lines. While FM-based methods perform well in large-scale environments, they become computationally expensive with a growing number of mapping points and lines. Conversely, approaches that learn to encode mapping features within a single network reduce memory footprint but are prone to overfitting, as they may capture unnecessary correlations between points and lines. We propose that these features should be learned independently, each with a distinct focus, to achieve optimal accuracy. To this end, we introduce a new architecture that learns to prioritize each feature independently before combining them for localization.

Equirectangular projection (ERP) images, with their large fields of view, are particularly suited for dense matching techniques that aim to establish comprehensive correspondences across images. However, ERP images are subject to significant distortions, which we address by leveraging the spherical camera model and geodesic flow refinement in the dense matching method. To further mitigate these distortions, we propose spherical positional embeddings based on 3D Cartesian coordinates of the feature grid. Additionally, our method incorporates bidirectional transformations between spherical and Cartesian coordinate systems during refinement, utilizing a unit sphere to improve matching performance. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves notable performance enhancements, with improvements of +26.72 and +42.62 in AUC@5{\deg} on the Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional lightweight trackers often struggle with robustness under occlusion and interference, while deep trackers, when compressed to meet resource constraints, suffer from performance degradation. To address these issues, we introduce CFTrack, a lightweight tracker that integrates contrastive learning and feature matching to enhance discriminative feature representations. CFTrack dynamically assesses target similarity during prediction through a novel contrastive feature matching module optimized with an adaptive contrastive loss, thereby improving tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on LaSOT, OTB100, and UAV123 show that CFTrack surpasses many state-of-the-art lightweight trackers, operating at 136 frames per second on the NVIDIA Jetson NX platform. Results on the HOOT dataset further demonstrate CFTrack's strong discriminative ability under heavy occlusion.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the input text description alone provides limited control over the precise objects movements and camera framing. In this work, we tackle the motion customization problem, where a reference video is provided as motion guidance. While most existing methods choose to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct the frame differences of the reference video, we observe that such strategy suffer from content leakage from the reference video, and they cannot capture complex motion accurately. To address this issue, we propose MotionMatcher, a motion customization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained T2V diffusion model at the feature level. Instead of using pixel-level objectives, MotionMatcher compares high-level, spatio-temporal motion features to fine-tune diffusion models, ensuring precise motion learning. For the sake of memory efficiency and accessibility, we utilize a pre-trained T2V diffusion model, which contains considerable prior knowledge about video motion, to compute these motion features. In our experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art motion customization performances, validating the design of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b09902097/motionmatcher/</p></details> | None |

Our approach begins by constructing a universal image feature dictionary using a multi-stage approach involving modified spatial pyramid pooling, dimension reduction, and multi-scale feature clustering. For each input image, we learn to synthesize a conditioning latent by selecting and synthesizing relevant features from the dictionary, which significantly enhances the model's capability in capturing and exploring image source correlation. This conditional latent synthesis involves a correlation-based feature matching and alignment strategy, comprising a Conditional Latent Matching (CLM) module and a Conditional Latent Synthesis (CLS) module. The synthesized latent is then used to guide the encoding process, allowing for more efficient compression by exploiting the correlation between the input image and the reference dictionary. According to our theoretical analysis, the proposed conditional latent coding (CLC) method is robust to perturbations in the external dictionary samples and the selected conditioning latent, with an error bound that scales logarithmically with the dictionary size, ensuring stability even with large and diverse dictionaries. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our new method improves the coding performance by a large margin (up to 1.2 dB) with a very small overhead of approximately 0.5\% bits per pixel.

Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode.

The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that ZeroBP outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot pose estimation methods, achieving an improvement of 9.1% in average recall of correct poses.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 | None |

Existing methods typically rely on customized calibration targets or fixed scene types, lacking the flexibility to handle variations in sensor data and environmental contexts. This paper introduces EdO-LCEC, the first environment-driven, online calibration approach that achieves human-like adaptability. Inspired by the human perceptual system, EdO-LCEC incorporates a generalizable scene discriminator to actively interpret environmental conditions, creating multiple virtual cameras that capture detailed spatial and textural information. To overcome cross-modal feature matching challenges between LiDAR and camera, we propose dual-path correspondence matching (DPCM), which leverages both structural and textural consistency to achieve reliable 3D-2D correspondences. Our approach formulates the calibration process as a spatial-temporal joint optimization problem, utilizing global constraints from multiple views and scenes to improve accuracy, particularly in sparse or partially overlapping sensor views. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EdO-LCEC achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing reliable and precise calibration across diverse, challenging environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there remains a persistent demand for both robust and fast matching techniques. To address this, we propose a novel Mamba-based local feature matching approach, called MambaGlue, where Mamba is an emerging state-of-the-art architecture rapidly gaining recognition for its superior speed in both training and inference, and promising performance compared with Transformer architectures. In particular, we propose two modules: a) MambaAttention mixer to simultaneously and selectively understand the local and global context through the Mamba-based self-attention structure and b) deep confidence score regressor, which is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture that evaluates a score indicating how confidently matching predictions correspond to the ground-truth correspondences. Consequently, our MambaGlue achieves a balance between robustness and efficiency in real-world applications. As verified on various public datasets, we demonstrate that our MambaGlue yields a substantial performance improvement over baseline approaches while maintaining fast inference speed.

Despite recent progress in data-driven models, feature correspondence learning is still limited by the lack of accurate per-pixel correspondence labels. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new self-supervised scheme, imperative learning (IL), for training feature correspondence. It enables correspondence learning on arbitrary uninterrupted videos without any camera pose or depth labels, heralding a new era for self-supervised correspondence learning. Specifically, we formulated the problem of correspondence learning as a bilevel optimization, which takes the reprojection error from bundle adjustment as a supervisory signal for the model. To avoid large memory and computation overhead, we leverage the stationary point to effectively back-propagate the implicit gradients through bundle adjustment. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance on tasks including feature matching and pose estimation, in which we obtained an average of 30% accuracy gain over the state-of-the-art matching models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint corresponds to the Accepted Manuscript in European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024</p></details> | None |

However, their development is hindered by a lack of suitable datasets with 3D ground truth. This work explores an approach to generating realistic and accurate ex vivo datasets tailored for 3D reconstruction and feature matching in open orthopedic surgery. A set of posed images and an accurately registered ground truth surface mesh of the scene are required to develop vision-based 3D reconstruction and matching methods suitable for surgery. We propose a framework consisting of three core steps and compare different methods for each step: 3D scanning, calibration of viewpoints for a set of high-resolution RGB images, and an optical-based method for scene registration. We evaluate each step of this framework on an ex vivo scoliosis surgery using a pig spine, conducted under real operating room conditions. A mean 3D Euclidean error of 0.35 mm is achieved with respect to the 3D ground truth. The proposed method results in submillimeter accurate 3D ground truths and surgical images with a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm. This opens the door to acquiring future surgical datasets for high-precision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures.

In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a promising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a small yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization processes, necessitating excessive computing resources and training time. In this paper, we revisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two pervasive issues therein: (1) various GC optimization strategies converge to coarse-grained class-level node feature matching between the original and condensed graphs; (2) existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph network architecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with iterative gradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a training-free GC framework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC), which refines the node distribution matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a novel class-to-node paradigm, transforming the GC optimization into a class partition problem which can be efficiently solved by any clustering methods. Moreover, CGC incorporates a pre-defined graph structure to enable a closed-form solution for condensed node features, eliminating the need for back-and-forth gradient descent in existing GC approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC achieves an exceedingly efficient condensation process with advanced accuracy. Compared with the state-of-the-art GC methods, CGC condenses the Ogbn-products graph within 30 seconds, achieving a speedup ranging from $10^2$X to $10^4$X and increasing accuracy by up to 4.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25)</p></details> | None |

However, in real applications the text image is sometimes long due to detected with multiple horizontal words. It triggers the requirement to build long text recognition models from readily available short (i.e., word-level) text datasets, which has been less studied previously. In this paper, we term this task Out of Length (OOL) text recognition. We establish the first Long Text Benchmark (LTB) to facilitate the assessment of different methods in long text recognition. Meanwhile, we propose a novel method called OOL Text Recognition with sub-String Matching (SMTR). SMTR comprises two cross-attention-based modules: one encodes a sub-string containing multiple characters into next and previous queries, and the other employs the queries to attend to the image features, matching the sub-string and simultaneously recognizing its next and previous character. SMTR can recognize text of arbitrary length by iterating the process above. To avoid being trapped in recognizing highly similar sub-strings, we introduce a regularization training to compel SMTR to effectively discover subtle differences between similar sub-strings for precise matching. In addition, we propose an inference augmentation strategy to alleviate confusion caused by identical sub-strings in the same text and improve the overall recognition efficiency. Extensive experimental results reveal that SMTR, even when trained exclusively on short text, outperforms existing methods in public short text benchmarks and exhibits a clear advantage on LTB.

In this work, we introduces an effective and robust high-dimensional (HD) feature descriptor for event frames, utilizing Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). The topological similarity among neighboring variables within VSA contributes to the enhanced representation similarity of feature descriptors for flow-matching points, while its structured symbolic representation capacity facilitates feature fusion from both event polarities and multiple spatial scales. Based on this HD feature descriptor, we propose a novel feature matching framework for event-based optical flow, encompassing both model-based (VSA-Flow) and self-supervised learning (VSA-SM) methods. In VSA-Flow, accurate optical flow estimation validates the effectiveness of HD feature descriptors. In VSA-SM, a novel similarity maximization method based on the HD feature descriptor is proposed to learn optical flow in a self-supervised way from events alone, eliminating the need for auxiliary grayscale images. Evaluation results demonstrate that our VSA-based method achieves superior accuracy in comparison to both model-based and self-supervised learning methods on the DSEC benchmark, while remains competitive among both methods on the MVSEC benchmark. This contribution marks a significant advancement in event-based optical flow within the feature matching methodology.</p></details> |  | None |

Among these, sparse feature matching stands out as an efficient, versatile, and generally lightweight approach with numerous applications. However, feature-based methods often struggle with significant viewpoint and appearance changes, leading to matching failures and inaccurate pose estimates. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages a globally sparse yet locally dense 3D representation of 2D features. By tracking and triangulating landmarks over a sequence of frames, we construct a sparse voxel map optimized to render image patch descriptors observed during tracking. Given an initial pose estimate, we first synthesize descriptors from the voxels using volumetric rendering and then perform feature matching to estimate the camera pose. This methodology enables the generation of descriptors for unseen views, enhancing robustness to view changes. We extensively evaluate our method on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art feature representation techniques in indoor environments, achieving up to a 39% improvement in median translation error. Additionally, our approach yields comparable results to other methods for outdoor scenarios while maintaining lower memory and computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Tucson, Arizona, US, Feb 28-Mar 4, 2025</p></details> | None |

This technique is built on constructing multiple homography hypotheses to approximate the continuous correspondence in the real world and uni-directional cross-attention to accelerate the refinement. On the YFCC100M dataset, our matching accuracy is competitive with LoFTR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture, while the inference speed is boosted to 4 times, even outperforming the CNN-based methods.

Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any local-graph-based point cloud analysis method. In this paper, we focus on two distinct methodologies: Deep Closest Point (DCP) and Deep Universal Manifold Embedding (DeepUME). Our extensive benchmarking on the ModelNet40 and FAUST datasets highlights the efficacy of the proposed method in point cloud registration tasks. Moreover, we establish for the first time that the features acquired through point cloud registration inherently can possess discriminative capabilities.

COLMAP is frequently employed for preprocessing to estimate poses, while it necessitates a large number of feature matches to operate effectively, and it struggles with scenes characterized by sparse features, large baselines between images, or a limited number of input images. We aim to tackle few-view NeRF reconstruction using only 3 to 6 unposed scene images. Traditional methods often use calibration boards but they are not common in images. We propose a novel idea of utilizing everyday objects, commonly found in both images and real life, as "pose probes". The probe object is automatically segmented by SAM, whose shape is initialized from a cube. We apply a dual-branch volume rendering optimization (object NeRF and scene NeRF) to constrain the pose optimization and jointly refine the geometry. Specifically, object poses of two views are first estimated by PnP matching in an SDF representation, which serves as initial poses. PnP matching, requiring only a few features, is suitable for feature-sparse scenes. Additional views are incrementally incorporated to refine poses from preceding views. In experiments, PoseProbe achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis across multiple datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in few-view and large-baseline scenes where COLMAP struggles. In ablations, using different objects in a scene yields comparable performance.

Generative Replay (GR)-based CL systems utilize a generative model to produce synthetic versions of past data, which are then combined with new data to retrain the primary model. Traditional machine learning techniques in this domain often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, where a model's performance on old data degrades over time.

A unified perspective for this task is to treat it as a searching problem, aiming at an efficient search strategy to narrow the search space to point matches between images. One of the key aspects of search strategy is the search space, which in current approaches is not carefully defined, resulting in limited matching accuracy. This paper, thus, pays attention to the search space and proposes to set the initial search space for point matching as the matched image areas containing prominent semantic, named semantic area matches. This search space favors point matching by salient features and alleviates the accuracy limitation in recent Transformer-based matching methods. To achieve this search space, we introduce a hierarchical feature matching framework: Area to Point Matching (A2PM), to first find semantic area matches between images and later perform point matching on area matches. We further propose Semantic and Geometry Area Matching (SGAM) method to realize this framework, which utilizes semantic prior and geometry consistency to establish accurate area matches between images. By integrating SGAM with off-the-shelf state-of-the-art matchers, our method, adopting the A2PM framework, achieves encouraging precision improvements in massive point matching and pose estimation experiments.</p></details> | v3 | None |

Different from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method introduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the intermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the student model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context modeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task loss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention alignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level information transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were comprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language processing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close to the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline models such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance improvements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that the feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression method that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage requirements while maintaining model capabilities. Future research can be further expanded in the directions of self-supervised learning, cross-modal feature alignment, and multi-task transfer learning to provide more flexible and efficient solutions for the deployment and optimization of deep learning models.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |
| **[Cross-PCR: A Robust Cross-Source Point Cloud Registration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18873v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the density inconsistency and distribution difference between cross-source point clouds, previous methods fail in cross-source point cloud registration. We propose a density-robust feature extraction and matching scheme to achieve robust and accurate cross-source registration. To address the density inconsistency between cross-source data, we introduce a density-robust encoder for extracting density-robust features. To tackle the issue of challenging feature matching and few correct correspondences, we adopt a loose-to-strict matching pipeline with a ``loose generation, strict selection'' idea. Under it, we employ a one-to-many strategy to loosely generate initial correspondences. Subsequently, high-quality correspondences are strictly selected to achieve robust registration through sparse matching and dense matching. On the challenging Kinect-LiDAR scene in the cross-source 3DCSR dataset, our method improves feature matching recall by 63.5 percentage points (pp) and registration recall by 57.6 pp. It also achieves the best performance on 3DMatch, while maintaining robustness under diverse downsampling densities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Context-Aware Outlier Rejection for Robust Multi-View 3D Tracking of Similar Small Birds in An Outdoor Aviary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16511v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for robust 3D tracking of multiple birds in an outdoor aviary using a multi-camera system. Our method addresses the challenges of visually similar birds and their rapid movements by leveraging environmental landmarks for enhanced feature matching and 3D reconstruction. In our approach, outliers are rejected based on their nearest landmark. This enables precise 3D-modeling and simultaneous tracking of multiple birds. By utilizing environmental context, our approach significantly improves the differentiation between visually similar birds, a key obstacle in existing tracking systems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing a $20\%$ elimination of outliers in the 3D reconstruction process, with a $97\%$ accuracy in matching. This remarkable accuracy in 3D modeling translates to robust and reliable tracking of multiple birds, even in challenging outdoor conditions. Our work not only advances the field of computer vision but also provides a valuable tool for studying bird behavior and movement patterns in natural settings. We also provide a large annotated dataset of 80 birds residing in four enclosures for 20 hours of footage which provides a rich testbed for researchers in computer vision, ornithologists, and ecologists.

| **[SplatR : Experience Goal Visual Rearrangement with 3D Gaussian Splatting and Dense Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14322v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experience Goal Visual Rearrangement task stands as a foundational challenge within Embodied AI, requiring an agent to construct a robust world model that accurately captures the goal state. The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BSAFusion: A Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment Network for Unaligned Medical Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08050v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If unaligned multimodal medical images can be simultaneously aligned and fused using a single-stage approach within a unified processing framework, it will not only achieve mutual promotion of dual tasks but also help reduce the complexity of the model. However, the design of this model faces the challenge of incompatible requirements for feature fusion and alignment; specifically, feature alignment requires consistency among corresponding features, whereas feature fusion requires the features to be complementary to each other. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an unaligned medical image fusion method called Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment and Fusion (BSFA-F) strategy. To reduce the negative impact of modality differences on cross-modal feature matching, we incorporate the Modal Discrepancy-Free Feature Representation (MDF-FR) method into BSFA-F. MDF-FR utilizes a Modality Feature Representation Head (MFRH) to integrate the global information of the input image. By injecting the information contained in MFRH of the current image into other modality images, it effectively reduces the impact of modality differences on feature alignment while preserving the complementary information carried by different images. In terms of feature alignment, BSFA-F employs a bidirectional stepwise alignment deformation field prediction strategy based on the path independence of vector displacement between two points. This strategy solves the problem of large spans and inaccurate deformation field prediction in single-step alignment. Finally, Multi-Modal Feature Fusion block achieves the fusion of aligned features. The experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Context Alignment with Disentangled Geometric and Temporal Modeling for Semantic Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08243v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) is crucial for understanding complex 3D scenes from limited 2D image observations. Existing SOP methods typically aggregate contextual features to assist the occupancy representation learning, alleviating issues like occlusion or ambiguity. However, these solutions often face misalignment issues wherein the corresponding features at the same position across different frames may have different semantic meanings during the aggregation process, which leads to unreliable contextual fusion results and an unstable representation learning process. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hierarchical context alignment paradigm for a more accurate SOP (Hi-SOP). Hi-SOP first disentangles the geometric and temporal context for separate alignment, which two branches are then composed to enhance the reliability of SOP. This parsing of the visual input into a local-global alignment hierarchy includes: (I) disentangled geometric and temporal separate alignment, within each leverages depth confidence and camera pose as prior for relevant feature matching respectively; (II) global alignment and composition of the transformed geometric and temporal volumes based on semantics consistency. Our method outperforms SOTAs for semantic scene completion on the SemanticKITTI & NuScenes-Occupancy datasets and LiDAR semantic segmentation on the NuScenes dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LVP-CLIP:Revisiting CLIP for Continual Learning with Label Vector Pool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05840v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning aims to update a model so that it can sequentially learn new tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Recent continual learning approaches often leverage the vision-language model CLIP for its high-dimensional feature space and cross-modality feature matching. Traditional CLIP-based classification methods identify the most similar text label for a test image by comparing their embeddings. However, these methods are sensitive to the quality of text phrases and less effective for classes lacking meaningful text labels. In this work, we rethink CLIP-based continual learning and introduce the concept of Label Vector Pool (LVP). LVP replaces text labels with training images as similarity references, eliminating the need for ideal text descriptions. We present three variations of LVP and evaluate their performance on class and domain incremental learning tasks. Leveraging CLIP's high dimensional feature space, LVP learning algorithms are task-order invariant. The new knowledge does not modify the old knowledge, hence, there is minimum forgetting. Different tasks can be learned independently and in parallel with low computational and memory demands. Experimental results show that proposed LVP-based methods outperform the current state-of-the-art baseline by a significant margin of 40.7%.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to CVPR2025</p></details> | None |

This leads to many-to-one matches and numerous potential inliers without any corresponding point. Recently, some approaches have framed the feature matching task as an assignment problem to achieve optimal one-to-one matches. We argue that the transition to the Assignment problem is not reliable for general correspondence-based PCR. In this paper, we propose a heuristics stable matching policy called GS-matching, inspired by the Gale-Shapley algorithm. Compared to the other matching policies, our method can perform efficiently and find more non-repetitive inliers under low overlapping conditions. Furthermore, we employ the probability theory to analyze the feature matching task, providing new insights into this research problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our matching policy, achieving better registration recall on multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Maximizing Alignment with Minimal Feedback: Efficiently Learning Rewards for Visuomotor Robot Policy Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04835v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visuomotor robot policies, increasingly pre-trained on large-scale datasets, promise significant advancements across robotics domains. However, aligning these policies with end-user preferences remains a challenge, particularly when the preferences are hard to specify. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant mechanism for alignment in non-embodied domains like large language models, it has not seen the same success in aligning visuomotor policies due to the prohibitive amount of human feedback required to learn visual reward functions. To address this limitation, we propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), an observation-only method for learning visual rewards from significantly less human preference feedback. Unlike traditional RLHF, RAPL focuses human feedback on fine-tuning pre-trained vision encoders to align with the end-user's visual representation and then constructs a dense visual reward via feature matching in this aligned representation space. We first validate RAPL through simulation experiments in the X-Magical benchmark and Franka Panda robotic manipulation, demonstrating that it can learn rewards aligned with human preferences, more efficiently uses preference data, and generalizes across robot embodiments. Finally, our hardware experiments align pre-trained Diffusion Policies for three object manipulation tasks. We find that RAPL can fine-tune these policies with 5x less real human preference data, taking the first step towards minimizing human feedback while maximizing visuomotor robot policy alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJRR, this paper is an extended journal version of the conference paper arXiv:2310.07932 with new results and discussion. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.07932</p></details> | None |

Existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods often fall short in sparse view settings and during large camera movements due to their reliance on gradient descent-based optimization, which is both slow and inaccurate. FlashSLAM addresses these limitations by combining 3DGS with a fast vision-based camera tracking technique, utilizing a pretrained feature matching model and point cloud registration for precise pose estimation in under 80 ms - a 90% reduction in tracking time compared to SplaTAM - without costly iterative rendering. In sparse settings, our method achieves up to a 92% improvement in average tracking accuracy over previous methods. Additionally, it accounts for noise in depth sensors, enhancing robustness when using unspecialized devices such as smartphones. Extensive experiments show that FlashSLAM performs reliably across both sparse and dense settings, in synthetic and real-world environments. Evaluations on benchmark datasets highlight its superior accuracy and efficiency, establishing FlashSLAM as a versatile and high-performance solution for SLAM, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D reconstruction across diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Symmetric Perception and Ordinal Regression for Detecting Scoliosis Natural Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15799v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scoliosis is one of the most common diseases in adolescents. Traditional screening methods for the scoliosis usually use radiographic examination, which requires certified experts with medical instruments and brings the radiation risk. Considering such requirement and inconvenience, we propose to use natural images of the human back for wide-range scoliosis screening, which is a challenging problem. In this paper, we notice that the human back has a certain degree of symmetry, and asymmetrical human backs are usually caused by spinal lesions. Besides, scoliosis severity levels have ordinal relationships. Taking inspiration from this, we propose a dual-path scoliosis detection network with two main modules: symmetric feature matching module (SFMM) and ordinal regression head (ORH). Specifically, we first adopt a backbone to extract features from both the input image and its horizontally flipped image. Then, we feed the two extracted features into the SFMM to capture symmetric relationships. Finally, we use the ORH to transform the ordinal regression problem into a series of binary classification sub-problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods as well as human performance, which provides a promising and economic solution to wide-range scoliosis screening. In particular, our method achieves accuracies of 95.11% and 81.46% in estimation of general severity level and fine-grained severity level of the scoliosis, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Applied Intelligence</p></details> | None |

Our model maintains a global point cloud representation of the scene, continuously updating the features and 3D locations of points as new images are observed. It expands the point cloud with newly detected points while carefully removing redundancies. The point cloud updates and the depth predictions for new points are achieved through a novel ray-based 2D-3D feature matching technique, which is robust against errors in previous point position predictions. In contrast to offline methods, our approach processes infinite-length sequences and provides real-time updates. Additionally, the point cloud imposes no pre-defined resolution or scene size constraints, and its unified global representation ensures view consistency across perspectives. Experiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our method achieves comparable quality among online MVS approaches.

| **[When to Extract ReID Features: A Selective Approach for Improved Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06617v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting and matching Re-Identification (ReID) features is used by many state-of-the-art (SOTA) Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) methods, particularly effective against frequent and long-term occlusions. While end-to-end object detection and tracking have been the main focus of recent research, they have yet to outperform traditional methods in benchmarks like MOT17 and MOT20. Thus, from an application standpoint, methods with separate detection and embedding remain the best option for accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation, though they are impractical for edge devices due to the overhead involved. In this paper, we investigate a selective approach to minimize the overhead of feature extraction while preserving accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation. This approach can be integrated into various SOTA methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to StrongSORT and Deep OC-SORT. Experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets show that our mechanism retains the advantages of feature extraction during occlusions while significantly reducing runtime. Additionally, it improves accuracy by preventing confusion in the feature-matching stage, particularly in cases of deformation and appearance similarity, which are common in DanceTrack. https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-StrongSORT, https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-Deep-OC-SORT</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DIS-Mine: Instance Segmentation for Disaster-Awareness in Poor-Light Condition in Underground Mines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13544v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting disasters in underground mining, such as explosions and structural damage, has been a persistent challenge over the years. This problem is compounded for first responders, who often have no clear information about the extent or nature of the damage within the mine. The poor-light or even total darkness inside the mines makes rescue efforts incredibly difficult, leading to a tragic loss of life. In this paper, we propose a novel instance segmentation method called DIS-Mine, specifically designed to identify disaster-affected areas within underground mines under low-light or poor visibility conditions, aiding first responders in rescue efforts. DIS-Mine is capable of detecting objects in images, even in complete darkness, by addressing challenges such as high noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast. The key innovations of DIS-Mine are built upon four core components: i) Image brightness improvement, ii) Instance segmentation with SAM integration, iii) Mask R-CNN-based segmentation, and iv) Mask alignment with feature matching. On top of that, we have collected real-world images from an experimental underground mine, introducing a new dataset named ImageMine, specifically gathered in low-visibility conditions. This dataset serves to validate the performance of DIS-Mine in realistic, challenging environments. Our comprehensive experiments on the ImageMine dataset, as well as on various other datasets demonstrate that DIS-Mine achieves a superior F1 score of 86.0% and mIoU of 72.0%, outperforming state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, with at least 15x improvement and up to 80% higher precision in object detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Counterfactual Learning-Driven Representation Disentanglement for Search-Enhanced Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18631v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For recommender systems in internet platforms, search activities provide additional insights into user interest through query-click interactions with items, and are thus widely used for enhancing personalized recommendation. However, these interacted items not only have transferable features matching users' interest helpful for the recommendation domain, but also have features related to users' unique intents in the search domain. Such domain gap of item features is neglected by most current search-enhanced recommendation methods. They directly incorporate these search behaviors into recommendation, and thus introduce partial negative transfer. To address this, we propose a Counterfactual learning-driven representation disentanglement framework for search-enhanced recommendation, based on the common belief that a user would click an item under a query not solely because of the item-query match but also due to the item's query-independent general features (e.g., color or style) that interest the user. These general features exclude the reflection of search-specific intents contained in queries, ensuring a pure match to users' underlying interest to complement recommendation. According to counterfactual thinking, how would user preferences and query match change for items if we removed their query-related features in search, we leverage search queries to construct counterfactual signals to disentangle item representations, isolating only query-independent general features. These representations subsequently enable feature augmentation and data augmentation for the recommendation scenario. Comprehensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate ClardRec is effective in both collaborative filtering and sequential recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
