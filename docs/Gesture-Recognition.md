| **[HandyLabel: Towards Post-Processing to Real-Time Annotation Using Skeleton Based Hand Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22337v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of machine learning is deeply linked to the availability of high-quality training data, yet retrieving and manually labeling new data remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. Traditional annotation tools, such as Label Studio, often require post-processing, where users label data after it has been recorded. Post-processing is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially with large datasets, and may lead to erroneous annotations due to the difficulty of subjects' memory tasks when labeling cognitive activities such as emotions or comprehension levels. In this work, we introduce HandyLabel, a real-time annotation tool that leverages hand gesture recognition to map hand signs for labeling. The application enables users to customize gesture mappings through a web-based interface, allowing for real-time annotations. To ensure the performance of HandyLabel, we evaluate several hand gesture recognition models on an open-source hand sign (HaGRID) dataset, with and without skeleton-based preprocessing. We discovered that ResNet50 with preprocessed skeleton-based images performs an F1-score of 0.923. To validate the usability of HandyLabel, a user study was conducted with 46 participants. The results suggest that 88.9% of participants preferred HandyLabel over traditional annotation tools.</p></details> |  | None |

Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain. The proposed approach achieves robust classification of different dance styles with low computational effort, as complex model architectures are not required, and shows that interpretable motion representations can effectively capture stylistic nuances.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scale What Counts, Mask What Matters: Evaluating Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Wi-Fi Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18792v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Wi-Fi sensing offers a compelling, privacy-preserving alternative to cameras, its practical utility has been fundamentally undermined by a lack of robustness across domains. Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical "domain shift" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Wireless Charger as a Gesture Sensor: A Novel Approach to Ubiquitous Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16989v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in information technology have increased demand for natural human-computer interaction in areas such as gaming, smart homes, and vehicles. However, conventional approaches like physical buttons or cameras are often limited by contact requirements, privacy concerns, and high costs.Motivated by the observation that these EM signals are not only strong and measurable but also rich in gesture-related information, we propose EMGesture, a novel contactless interaction technique that leverages the electromagnetic (EM) signals from Qi wireless chargers for gesture recognition. EMGesture analyzes the distinctive EM features and employs a robust classification model. The end-to-end framework enables it capable of accurately interpreting user intent. Experiments involving 30 participants, 10 mobile devices, and 5 chargers showed that EMGesture achieves over 97% recognition accuracy. Corresponding user studies also confirmed higher usability and convenience, which demonstrating that EMGesture is a practical, privacy-conscious, and cost-effective solution for pervasive interaction.</p></details> | 21 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[Dynamic Black-box Backdoor Attacks on IoT Sensory Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14074v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor data-based recognition systems are widely used in various applications, such as gait-based authentication and human activity recognition (HAR). Modern wearable and smart devices feature various built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, and such sensor-based measurements can be fed to a machine learning-based model to train and classify human activities. While deep learning-based models have proven successful in classifying human activity and gestures, they pose various security risks. In our paper, we discuss a novel dynamic trigger-generation technique for performing black-box adversarial attacks on sensor data-based IoT systems. Our empirical analysis shows that the attack is successful on various datasets and classifier models with minimal perturbation on the input data. We also provide a detailed comparative analysis of performance and stealthiness to various other poisoning techniques found in backdoor attacks. We also discuss some adversarial defense mechanisms and their impact on the effectiveness of our trigger-generation technique.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[End to End AI System for Surgical Gesture Sequence Recognition and Clinical Outcome Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11899v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained analysis of intraoperative behavior and its impact on patient outcomes remain a longstanding challenge. We present Frame-to-Outcome (F2O), an end-to-end system that translates tissue dissection videos into gesture sequences and uncovers patterns associated with postoperative outcomes. Leveraging transformer-based spatial and temporal modeling and frame-wise classification, F2O robustly detects consecutive short (~2 seconds) gestures in the nerve-sparing step of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (AUC: 0.80 frame-level; 0.81 video-level). F2O-derived features (gesture frequency, duration, and transitions) predicted postoperative outcomes with accuracy comparable to human annotations (0.79 vs. 0.75; overlapping 95% CI). Across 25 shared features, effect size directions were concordant with small differences (~ 0.07), and strong correlation (r = 0.96, p < 1e-14). F2O also captured key patterns linked to erectile function recovery, including prolonged tissue peeling and reduced energy use. By enabling automatic interpretable assessment, F2O establishes a foundation for data-driven surgical feedback and prospective clinical decision support.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Wi-CBR: Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11616v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, it enables the model to not only explore a wider feature space but also to avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR), which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations while extracting kinematic features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavioral characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SASG-DA: Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation For Myoelectric Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08344v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interaction (HMI), particularly for rehabilitation and prosthetic control. However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Sampling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling (SASS) strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Large Sign Language Models: Toward 3D American Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08535v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Large Sign Language Models (LSLM), a novel framework for translating 3D American Sign Language (ASL) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone, which can benefit hearing-impaired individuals' virtual communication. Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi Class Parkinson Disease Detection Based on Finger Tapping Using Attention Enhanced CNN BiLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10121v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity is essential for effective clinical management and intervention development. Despite the proposal of several gesture based PD recognition systems, including those using the finger tapping task to assess Parkinsonian symptoms, their performance remains unsatisfactory. In this study, we present a multi class PD detection system based on finger-tapping, using an attention-enhanced CNN BiLSTM framework combined with handcrafted feature extraction and deep learning techniques. In the procedure, we used an existing dataset of finger tapping videos to extract temporal, frequency, and amplitude-based features from wrist and hand movements using their formulas. These handcrafted features were then processed through our attention enhanced CNN BiLSTM model, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms to classify PD severity into multiple levels. The features first pass through a Conv1D MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies, followed by processing through a BiLSTM layer to model the temporal dynamics of the motion. An attention mechanism is applied to emphasize the most informative temporal features, which are then refined by a second BiLSTM layer. The CNN derived features and attention enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by dense and dropout layers, before being passed through a softmax classifier to predict the PD severity level. Our model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between the five severity classes, showcasing the effectiveness of combining spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms for automated PD severity detection. This approach offers a promising non invasive tool to assist clinicians in monitoring PD progression and making informed treatment decisions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Achieving Effective Virtual Reality Interactions via Acoustic Gesture Recognition based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07085v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural and efficient interaction remains a critical challenge for virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) systems. Vision-based gesture recognition suffers from high computational cost, sensitivity to lighting conditions, and privacy leakage concerns. Acoustic sensing provides an attractive alternative: by emitting inaudible high-frequency signals and capturing their reflections, channel impulse response (CIR) encodes how gestures perturb the acoustic field in a low-cost and user-transparent manner. However, existing CIR-based gesture recognition methods often rely on extensive training of models on large labeled datasets, making them unsuitable for few-shot VR scenarios. In this work, we propose the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for CIR-based gesture recognition in VR/AR systems. Despite LLMs' strengths, it is non-trivial to achieve few-shot and zero-shot learning of CIR gestures due to their inconspicuous features. To tackle this challenge, we collect differential CIR rather than original CIR data. Moreover, we construct a real-world dataset collected from 10 participants performing 15 gestures across three categories (digits, letters, and shapes), with 10 repetitions each. We then conduct extensive experiments on this dataset using an LLM-adopted classifier. Results show that our LLM-based framework achieves accuracy comparable to classical machine learning baselines, while requiring no domain-specific retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, under review at ICASSP 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Stack Transformer Based Spatial-Temporal Attention Model for Dynamic Sign Language and Fingerspelling Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16855v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture-based Sign Language Recognition (SLR) serves as a crucial communication bridge between deaf and non-deaf individuals. While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are common, they are limited by their reliance on fixed skeletal graphs. To overcome this, we propose the Sequential Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (SSTAN), a novel Transformer-based architecture. Our model employs a hierarchical, stacked design that sequentially integrates Spatial Multi-Head Attention (MHA) to capture intra-frame joint relationships and Temporal MHA to model long-range inter-frame dependencies. This approach allows the model to efficiently learn complex spatio-temporal patterns without predefined graph structures. We validated our model through extensive experiments on diverse, large-scale datasets (WLASL, JSL, and KSL). A key finding is that our model, trained entirely from scratch, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the challenging fingerspelling categories (JSL and KSL). Furthermore, it establishes a new SOTA for skeleton-only methods on WLASL, outperforming several approaches that rely on complex self-supervised pre-training. These results demonstrate our model's high data efficiency and its effectiveness in capturing the intricate dynamics of sign language. The official implementation is available at our GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/K-Hirooka-Aizu/skeleton-slr-transformer}{https://github.com/K-Hirooka-Aizu/skeleton-slr-transformer}.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

| **[RF-Behavior: A Multimodal Radio-Frequency Dataset for Human Behavior and Emotion Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06020v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has demonstrated the complementary nature of camera-based and inertial data for modeling human gestures, activities, and sentiment. Yet, despite its growing importance for environmental sensing as well as the advance of joint communication and sensing for prospective WiFi and 6G standards, a dataset that integrates these modalities with radio frequency data (radar and RFID) remains rare. We introduce RF-Behavior, a multimodal radio frequency dataset for comprehensive human behavior and emotion analysis. We collected data from 44 participants performing 21 gestures, 10 activities, and 6 sentiment expressions. Data were captured using synchronized sensors, including 13 radars (8 ground-mounted and 5 ceiling-mounted), 6 to 8 RFID tags (attached to each arm) and LoRa. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) and 24 infrared cameras are used to provide precise motion ground truth. RF-Behavior provides a unified multimodal dataset spanning the full spectrum of human behavior -- from brief gestures to activities and emotional states -- enabling research on multi-task learning across motion and emotion recognition. Benchmark results demonstrate that the strategic sensor placement is complementary across modalities, with distinct performance characteristics across different behavioral categories.</p></details> |  | None |

A Graph-GRU temporal network is proposed to model both spatial and temporal dependencies between frames, enabling accurate classification. The model is trained and evaluated on the AUTSL (Ankara university Turkish sign language) dataset, achieving high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating graph-based spatial representations with temporal modeling, providing a scalable framework for sign language recognition. The results of this approach highlight the potential of pose-driven methods for sign language understanding.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[Accurate online action and gesture recognition system using detectors and Deep SPD Siamese Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05250v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network. The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gestura: A LVLM-Powered System Bridging Motion and Semantics for Real-Time Free-Form Gesture Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21814v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.</p></details> | IMWUT2025 | None |

This paper introduces an innovative application of vision-based dynamic gesture recognition (VDGR) for real-time music composition through gestures. To implement this application, we generate a custom gesture dataset that encompasses over 15000 samples across 21 classes, incorporating 7 musical notes each manifesting at three distinct pitch levels. To effectively deal with the modest volume of training data and to accurately discern and prioritize complex gesture sequences for music creation, we develop a multi-layer attention-based gated recurrent unit (MLA-GRU) model, in which gated recurrent unit (GRU) is used to learn temporal patterns from the observed sequence and an attention layer is employed to focus on musically pertinent gesture segments. Our empirical studies demonstrate that MLA-GRU significantly surpasses the classical GRU model, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 96.83% compared to the baseline's 86.7%. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior efficiency and processing speed, which are crucial for interactive applications. Using our proposed system, we believe that people will interact with music in a new and exciting way. It not only advances HCI experiences but also highlights MLA-GRU's effectiveness in scenarios demanding swift and precise gesture recognition.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Spiking Patches: Asynchronous, Sparse, and Efficient Tokens for Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26614v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches, specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the properties of event cameras.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IBIS: A Powerful Hybrid Architecture for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24936v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages. 8 figures.

| **[Enabling Vibration-Based Gesture Recognition on Everyday Furniture via Energy-Efficient FPGA Implementation of 1D Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23156v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability. This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1) We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and 1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment. A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25 FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches 0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit 1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference, demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, accepted by 2025 IEEE Annual Congress on Artificial Intelligence of Things (IEEE AIoT)</p></details> | None |

This study proposes an automatic sign language recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit, the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as ``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education and public services.</p></details> | in French language | None |
| **[Phase-driven Domain Generalizable Learning for Nonstationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05960v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern recognition is a fundamental task in continuous sensing applications, but real-world scenarios often experience distribution shifts that necessitate learning generalizable representations for such tasks. This challenge is exacerbated with time-series data, which also exhibit inherent nonstationarity--variations in statistical and spectral properties over time. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on learning generalizable representations for time-series classification by considering the phase information of a signal as an approximate proxy for nonstationarity and propose a phase-driven generalizable representation learning framework for time-series classification, PhASER. It consists of three key elements: 1) Hilbert transform-based augmentation, which diversifies nonstationarity while preserving task-specific discriminatory semantics, 2) separate magnitude-phase encoding, viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) phase-residual feature broadcasting, integrating 2D phase features with a residual connection to the 1D signal representation, providing inherent regularization to improve distribution-invariant learning. Extensive evaluations on five datasets from sleep-stage classification, human activity recognition, and gesture recognition against 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 11% in some cases. Additionally, the principles of PhASER can be broadly applied to enhance the generalizability of existing time-series representation learning models.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 | None |
| **[Conveying Meaning through Gestures: An Investigation into Semantic Co-Speech Gesture Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17599v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores two frameworks for co-speech gesture generation, AQ-GT and its semantically-augmented variant AQ-GT-a, to evaluate their ability to convey meaning through gestures and how humans perceive the resulting movements. Using sentences from the SAGA spatial communication corpus, contextually similar sentences, and novel movement-focused sentences, we conducted a user-centered evaluation of concept recognition and human-likeness. Results revealed a nuanced relationship between semantic annotations and performance. The original AQ-GT framework, lacking explicit semantic input, was surprisingly more effective at conveying concepts within its training domain. Conversely, the AQ-GT-a framework demonstrated better generalization, particularly for representing shape and size in novel contexts. While participants rated gestures from AQ-GT-a as more expressive and helpful, they did not perceive them as more human-like. These findings suggest that explicit semantic enrichment does not guarantee improved gesture generation and that its effectiveness is highly dependent on the context, indicating a potential trade-off between specialization and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Muscle Anatomy-aware Geometric Deep Learning for sEMG-based Gesture Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17660v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate decoding of gesture from non-invasive surface electromyography (sEMG) is important for various applications including spatial computing, healthcare, and entertainment, and has been actively pursued by researchers and industry. Majority of sEMG-based gesture decoding algorithms employ deep neural networks that are designed for Euclidean data, and may not be suitable for analyzing multi-dimensional, non-stationary time-series with long-range dependencies such as sEMG. State-of-the-art sEMG-based decoding methods also demonstrate high variability across subjects and sessions, requiring re-calibration and adaptive fine-tuning to boost performance. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes a geometric deep learning model that learns on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and leverages unsupervised domain adaptation to desensitize the model to subjects and sessions. The model captures the features in time and across sensors with multiple kernels, projects the features onto SPD manifold, learns on manifolds and projects back to Euclidean space for classification. It uses a domain-specific batch normalization layer to address variability between sessions, alleviating the need for re-calibration or fine-tuning. Experiments with publicly available benchmark gesture decoding datasets (Ninapro DB6, Flexwear-HD) demonstrate the superior generalizability of the model compared to Euclidean and other SPD-based models in the inter-session scenario, with up to 8.83 and 4.63 points improvement in accuracy, respectively. Detailed analyses reveal that the model extracts muscle-specific information for different tasks and ablation studies highlight the importance of modules introduced in the work. The proposed method pushes the state-of-the-art in sEMG-based gesture recognition and opens new research avenues for manifold-based learning for muscle signals.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically design separate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization, often relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for domain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be capable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this end, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate performance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our framework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more practical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only partially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a physics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency (ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting the intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from different antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition, we design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive learning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same class. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets. The results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all unsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks. UniCrossFi provides a principled and practical solution to the domain shift challenge, advancing the feasibility of robust, real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems that can operate effectively with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generalizing WiFi Gesture Recognition via Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13390v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0 benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world AIoT applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICPADS 2025</p></details> | None |

The dendrites in biological neurons have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however, the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites. Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks (speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task). Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables; This manuscript has been submitted for possible pulication</p></details> | None |

However, digital linguistic dataset resources for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the dataset, achieving classification accuracies of 90.45% and 88.78%, respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic effort to construct a benchmark dataset and assess deep learning approaches for NSL recognition, highlighting the potential of transfer learning and fine-tuning for advancing research in underexplored sign languages.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[MSF-Mamba: Motion-aware State Fusion Mamba for Efficient Micro-Gesture Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10478v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently, Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models (SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition, previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba (MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely, MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations, over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below 4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Touch Speaks, Sound Feels: A Multimodal Approach to Affective and Social Touch from Robots to Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07839v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affective tactile interaction constitutes a fundamental component of human communication. In natural human-human encounters, touch is seldom experienced in isolation; rather, it is inherently multisensory. Individuals not only perceive the physical sensation of touch but also register the accompanying auditory cues generated through contact. The integration of haptic and auditory information forms a rich and nuanced channel for emotional expression. While extensive research has examined how robots convey emotions through facial expressions and speech, their capacity to communicate social gestures and emotions via touch remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we developed a multimodal interaction system incorporating a 5*5 grid of 25 vibration motors synchronized with audio playback, enabling robots to deliver combined haptic-audio stimuli. In an experiment involving 32 Chinese participants, ten emotions and six social gestures were presented through vibration, sound, or their combination. Participants rated each stimulus on arousal and valence scales. The results revealed that (1) the combined haptic-audio modality significantly enhanced decoding accuracy compared to single modalities; (2) each individual channel-vibration or sound-effectively supported certain emotions recognition, with distinct advantages depending on the emotional expression; and (3) gestures alone were generally insufficient for conveying clearly distinguishable emotions. These findings underscore the importance of multisensory integration in affective human-robot interaction and highlight the complementary roles of haptic and auditory cues in enhancing emotional communication.</p></details> |  | None |

In the multivariate time series domain, existing approaches often produce counterfactuals that lack validity, plausibility, or intuitive interpretability. We present \textbf{GenFacts}, a novel generative framework for producing plausible and actionable counterfactual explanations for time series classifiers. GenFacts introduces a structured approach to latent space modeling and targeted counterfactual synthesis. We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture recognition as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts consistently outperforms baseline methods in plausibility metrics (+18.7\%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in user studies. These results underscore that realism and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are vital for actionable counterfactuals in time series applications.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |

Recent work on OST-AR depth perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load. These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or haptic-only conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Wearable and Ultra-Low-Power Fusion of EMG and A-Mode US for Hand-Wrist Kinematic Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02000v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW) system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable, dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23 degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to $12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$ score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.</p></details> |  | None |

Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of grounding complex visual cues in this domain.

Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to 57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient embodied HRI.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its performance is often limited by the scarcity of labeled EMG data, significant cross-user variability, and poor generalization to unseen gestures. To address these challenges, we propose SeqEMG-GAN, a conditional, sequence-driven generative framework that synthesizes high-fidelity EMG signals from hand joint angle sequences. Our method introduces a context-aware architecture composed of an angle encoder, a dual-layer context encoder featuring the novel Ang2Gist unit, a deep convolutional EMG generator, and a discriminator, all jointly optimized via adversarial learning. By conditioning on joint kinematic trajectories, SeqEMG-GAN is capable of generating semantically consistent EMG sequences, even for previously unseen gestures, thereby enhancing data diversity and physiological plausibility. Experimental results show that classifiers trained solely on synthetic data experience only a slight accuracy drop (from 57.77% to 55.71%). In contrast, training with a combination of real and synthetic data significantly improves accuracy to 60.53%, outperforming real-only training by 2.76%. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,also achieves the state-of-art performance in augmenting EMG datasets and enhancing gesture recognition performance for applications such as neural robotic hand control, AI/AR glasses, and gesture-based virtual gaming systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet most existing foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong generalization for sensing foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite extensive efforts, existing methodologies struggle to generalize effectively across users due to the intrinsic biological variability of EMG signals, resulting from anatomical heterogeneity and diverse task execution styles. To address this limitation, we introduce EMG-UP, a novel and effective framework for Unsupervised Personalization in cross-user gesture recognition. The proposed framework leverages a two-stage adaptation strategy: (1) Sequence-Cross Perspective Contrastive Learning, designed to disentangle robust and user-specific feature representations by capturing intrinsic signal patterns invariant to inter-user variability, and (2) Pseudo-Label-Guided Fine-Tuning, which enables model refinement for individual users without necessitating access to source domain data.

Existing methods, often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. The architecture processes these streams through specialized networks: a topology-aware graph convolution models the view-invariant shape from a wrist-centric frame, while a Finsler geometry-based encoder captures the context-aware trajectory from a facial-centric frame. These features are then integrated via a geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97%, and 99.79% accuracy on the challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300, and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters than competing models.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |

Recent findings indicate that learning a unified three-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs) derived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI signals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive noise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing preprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections used in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for multi-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas based on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler velocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand gesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided Wi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability, paving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments.</p></details> |  | None |

The system combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM) reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware, adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or commands.

| **[CoPlay: Audio-agnostic Cognitive Scaling for Acoustic Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10796v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acoustic sensing manifests great potential in various applications that encompass health monitoring, gesture interface and imaging by leveraging the speakers and microphones on smart devices. However, in ongoing research and development in acoustic sensing, one problem is often overlooked: the same speaker, when used concurrently for sensing and other traditional applications (like playing music), could cause interference in both making it impractical to use in the real world. The strong ultrasonic sensing signals mixed with music would overload the speaker's mixer. To confront this issue of overloaded signals, current solutions are clipping or down-scaling, both of which affect the music playback quality and also sensing range and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose CoPlay, a deep learning based optimization algorithm to cognitively adapt the sensing signal. It can 1) maximize the sensing signal magnitude within the available bandwidth left by the concurrent music to optimize sensing range and accuracy and 2) minimize any consequential frequency distortion that can affect music playback. In this work, we design a deep learning model and test it on common types of sensing signals (sine wave or Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave FMCW) as inputs with various agnostic concurrent music and speech. First, we evaluated the model performance to show the quality of the generated signals. Then we conducted field studies of downstream acoustic sensing tasks in the real world. A study with 12 users proved that respiration monitoring and gesture recognition using our adapted signal achieve similar accuracy as no-concurrent-music scenarios, while clipping or down-scaling manifests worse accuracy. A qualitative study also manifests that the music play quality is not degraded, unlike traditional clipping or down-scaling methods.</p></details> | ICCCN'25 | None |

Gesture recognition offers an intuitive control method that does not require physical contact with devices and can be implemented using various sensing technologies. Wireless solutions are particularly flexible and minimally invasive. While camera-based vision systems are commonly used, they often raise privacy concerns and can struggle in complex or poorly lit environments. In contrast, radar sensing preserves privacy, is robust to occlusions and lighting, and provides rich spatial data such as distance, relative velocity, and angle. We present a gesture-controlled robotic arm using mm-wave radar for reliable, contactless motion recognition. Nine gestures are recognized and mapped to real-time commands with precision. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the system practicality, performance and reliability for gesture-based robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work that treats gesture recognition and robotic control separately, our system unifies both into a real-time pipeline for seamless, contactless human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  | None |

However, owing to fundamental differences in wireless data structures, traditional data augmentation techniques may not be suitable for wireless data. Fortunately, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can be an effective solution to wireless data augmentation due to its excellent data generation capability. This article systematically explores the potential and effectiveness of generative data augmentation in wireless networks. We first briefly review data augmentation techniques, discuss their limitations in wireless networks, and introduce generative data augmentation, including reviewing GenAI models and their applications in data augmentation. We then explore the application prospects of generative data augmentation in wireless networks from the physical, network, and application layers, providing a generative data augmentation architecture for each application. Subsequently, we propose a general generative data augmentation framework for Wi-Fi gesture recognition. Specifically, we leverage transformer-based diffusion models to generate high-quality channel state information data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct a case study using the Widar 3.0 dataset, which employs a residual network model for Wi-Fi gesture recognition. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can enhance the performance of Wi-Fi gesture recognition. Finally, we discuss research directions for generative data augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to individual variability in sensor signals and user behavior, static models may not provide optimal performance for all users. Personalizing pretrained models via calibration--collecting labeled data from each user--can improve performance but introduces user friction and struggles with limited data. To overcome these issues, we propose a calibrationless longitudinal personalization method: a contextual multi-arm bandit (MAB) algorithm combined with a pretrained neural network for gesture recognition. This reinforcement-learning-style approach enables personalization using binary reward signals, either user-provided or inferred by the system. We validated this method in a user study. Participants wore a surface electromyography (sEMG) device and played multiple rounds of a 2-D navigation game using six hand gestures. In the session, they completed a baseline round and then a round with our algorithm; in the second session, they played another round with our algorithm. Our approach led to a significant reduction in users' average false negative rate by 0.113 from the initial to the final round, with further decreases between sessions. Average precision also trended upward (by 0.139) from the start to end of a round, continuing in the next session. Notably, some users who could not complete the game with the baseline model succeeded with our contextual MAB model. In summary, our</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures. It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025 Workshop on AI-driven Skilled Activity Understanding, Assessment & Feedback Generation</p></details> | None |

However, conventional HAR models often fail to generalize when faced with user-specific variations, leading to degraded performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel on-device few-shot learning framework that bridges generalization and personalization in HAR. Our method first trains a generalizable representation across users and then rapidly adapts to new users with only a few labeled samples, updating lightweight classifier layers directly on resource-constrained devices. This approach achieves robust on-device learning with minimal computation and memory cost, making it practical for real-world deployment. We implement our framework on the energy-efficient RISC-V GAP9 microcontroller and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets (RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture). Across these scenarios, post-deployment adaptation improves accuracy by 3.73\%, 17.38\%, and 3.70\%, respectively. These results demonstrate that few-shot on-device learning enables scalable, user-aware, and energy-efficient wearable human activity recognition by seamlessly uniting generalization and personalization.

This study presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed an experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot that varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we evaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's communicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction positively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while noting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional speech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and shaped by robot behavior: Participants responded well to polite, reasoned suggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more personalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings suggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their effectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We propose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics between robots and human users.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shortened version of this paper was accepted as poster for the Thirteenth International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI2025)</p></details> | None |

To address these issues, we propose a low-cost real-time framework for industrial action recognition using foundation models, denoted as LRIAR, to enhance recognition accuracy and transferability while minimizing human annotation and computational overhead. The proposed framework constructs an automatically labeled dataset by coupling Grounding DINO with the pretrained BLIP-2 image encoder, enabling efficient and scalable action labeling. Leveraging the constructed dataset, we train YOLOv5 for real-time action detection, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier is deceloped via LoRA-based fine-tuning for action classification. Extensive experiments conducted in real-world industrial settings validate the effectiveness of LRIAR, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy, scenario generalization, and deployment efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Its education remains limited by the lack of qualified instructors, insufficient early exposure, and the inadequacy of traditional teaching methods. Recent advances in Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising new approaches to enhance sign language learning through immersive, interactive, and feedback-rich environments. This paper presents a systematic review of 55 peer-reviewed studies on VR-based sign language education, identifying and analyzing five core thematic areas: (1) gesture recognition and real-time feedback mechanisms; (2) interactive VR environments for communicative practice; (3) gamification for immersive and motivating learning experiences; (4) personalized and adaptive learning systems; and (5) accessibility and inclusivity for diverse DHH learners. The results reveal that AI-driven gesture recognition systems integrated with VR can provide real-time feedback, significantly improving learner engagement and performance. However, the analysis highlights critical challenges: hardware limitations, inconsistent accuracy in gesture recognition, and a lack of inclusive and adaptive design. This review contributes a comprehensive synthesis of technological and pedagogical innovations in the field, outlining current limitations and proposing actionable recommendations for developers and researchers. By bridging technical advancement with inclusive pedagogy, this review lays the foundation for next-generation VR systems that are equitable, effective, and accessible for sign language learners worldwide.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submited to Elsevier</p></details> | None |

While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4 percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain. On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by +52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable, privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages and submitted to FLTA2025 conference</p></details> | None |

This study investigates these challenges by using GPT-4V, a vision-language model, not as a performance benchmark but as a diagnostic tool to reveal patterns and causes of gesture misrecognition. We analysed a public dataset of pedestrian-vehicle interactions, combining manual video review with thematic analysis of the model's qualitative reasoning. This dual approach surfaced recurring factors influencing misrecognition, including gesture visibility, pedestrian behaviour, interaction context, and environmental conditions. The findings suggest practical considerations for gesture design, including the value of salience and contextual redundancy, and highlight opportunities to improve AV recognition systems through richer context modelling and uncertainty-aware interpretations. While centred on AV-pedestrian interaction, the method and insights are applicable to other domains where machines interpret human gestures, such as wearable AR and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Our results show that spectrogram-based representations significantly improve accuracy, while model architecture plays a smaller role. We also tested generalization to new robot poses, where spectrogram-based models performed better. Implemented on a Franka Emika Research robot, two of our methods, STFT2DCNN and STT3DCNN, achieved over 95% accuracy in contact detection and gesture classification.

In this paper, we introduce Grab-n-Go, the first wearable device that leverages active acoustic sensing to recognize subtle hand microgestures while holding various objects. Unlike prior systems that focus solely on free-hand gestures or basic hand-object activity recognition, Grab-n-Go simultaneously captures information about hand microgestures, grasping poses, and object geometries using a single wristband, enabling the recognition of fine-grained hand movements occurring within activities involving occupied hands. A deep learning framework processes these complex signals to identify 30 distinct microgestures, with 6 microgestures for each of the 5 grasping poses. In a user study with 10 participants and 25 everyday objects, Grab-n-Go achieved an average recognition accuracy of 92.0%. A follow-up study further validated Grab-n-Go's robustness against 10 more challenging, deformable objects. These results underscore the potential of Grab-n-Go to provide seamless, unobtrusive interactions without requiring modifications to existing objects. The complete dataset, comprising data from 18 participants performing 30 microgestures with 35 distinct objects, is publicly available at https://github.com/cjlisalee/Grab-n-Go_Data with the DOI: https://doi.org/10.7298/7kbd-vv75.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/cjlisalee/Grab-n-Go_Data) |

A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12, respectively.

This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition.

To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net, a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network, features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for Italian Sign Language.

However, mime -- the theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC. Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions. Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust understanding of human gestures.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings | None |

Most existing toolkits focus on streamlining model development but overlook the impact of electrode selection on classification accuracy. In this work, we present the first data-driven analysis of how electrode selection and classifier choice affect both accuracy and sparsity. Through a systematic evaluation of 28 combinations (4 selection schemes, 7 classifiers), across six datasets, we identify an approach that minimizes electrode count without compromising accuracy.

The literature mainly addresses this problem by applying machine learning techniques to classify sequences of tactile images encoding the pressure distribution generated when executing the gestures. However, some gestures can be hard to differentiate based on the information provided by tactile images alone. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective way to improve the accuracy of a gesture recognition classifier. Our approach focuses solely on processing the tactile images used as input by the classifier. In particular, we propose to explicitly highlight the dynamics of the contact in the tactile image by computing the dense optical flow. This additional information makes it easier to distinguish between gestures that produce similar tactile images but exhibit different contact dynamics. We validate the proposed approach in a tactile gesture recognition task, showing that a classifier trained on tactile images augmented with optical flow information achieved a 9% improvement in gesture classification accuracy compared to one trained on standard tactile images.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, paper accepted by the 2025 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (ROMAN)</p></details> | None |

Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods.

While deep learning models achieve over 97% classification accuracy, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored in the physical domain. We present ERa Attack, the first radio frequency (RF) adversarial method targeting EMG devices through intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI). Using low-power software-defined radio transmitters, attackers inject optimized RF perturbations to mislead downstream models. Our approach bridges digital and physical domains: we generate adversarial perturbations using Projected Gradient Descent, extract 50-150 Hz components via inverse STFT, and employ synchronization-free strategies (constant spectrum noise or narrowband modulation). Perturbations, constrained to 1-10% of signal amplitude, are amplitude-modulated onto 433 MHz carriers. Experiments on the Myo Dataset (7 gestures, 350 samples) demonstrate significant impact: at 1 meter and 0 dBm transmission power, classification accuracy drops from 97.8% to 58.3%, with 41.7% misclassification rate and 25.6% targeted attack success rate. Attack effectiveness decreases exponentially with distance, recovering to 85% accuracy at 3 meters. Increasing power to 10 dBm reduces accuracy by an additional 15% at 1 meter. This work pioneers RF-based adversarial attacks on EMG recognition systems, revealing critical vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications. We quantify attack effectiveness across different perturbation modes and distances, and propose defenses including hardware shielding, spectrum monitoring, and adversarial training. Our findings inform the design of robust EMG systems against electromagnetic threats.</p></details> |  | None |

This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text, bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences, followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR. By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to 6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper to appear at the 1st Workshop in Multimodal Sign Language Recognition at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[Hybrid-supervised Hypergraph-enhanced Transformer for Micro-gesture Based Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14867v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Camera-based implicit mind reading by capturing higher-order semantic dynamics of human gaze within environmental context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12889v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions. Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial, semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high generalizability and low deployment cost.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we present a lightweight deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system that enables humans to control collaborative robots naturally and efficiently. This model recognizes eight distinct hand gestures with only 1,103 parameters and a compact size of 22 KB, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%. To further optimize the model for real-world deployment on edge devices, we applied quantization and pruning using TensorFlow Lite, reducing the final model size to just 7 KB.

The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%.

Despite the large volume of research works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing, leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing mmWave systems typically employ fixed-position configurations, restricting user mobility to predefined zones and limiting practical deployment scenarios. We introduce mmEgoHand, a head-mounted egocentric system for hand pose estimation to support applications such as gesture recognition, VR interaction, skill digitization and assessment, and robotic teleoperation. mmEgoHand synergistically integrates mmWave radar with inertial measurement units (IMUs) to enable dynamic perception. The IMUs actively compensate for radar interference induced by head movements, while our novel end-to-end Transformer architecture simultaneously estimates 3D hand keypoint coordinates through multi-modal sensor fusion. This dual-modality framework achieves spatial-temporal alignment of mmWave heatmaps with IMUs, overcoming viewpoint instability inherent in egocentric sensing scenarios. We further demonstrate that intermediate hand pose representations substantially improve performance in downstream task, e.g., VR gesture recognition. Extensive evaluations with 10 subjects performing 8 gestures across 3 distinct postures -- standing, sitting, lying -- achieve 90.8% recognition accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.

Previous MR fabrication projects have primarily relied on digital menus and custom buttons as the interface for user interaction with the MR environment. Despite this approach being widely adopted, it is limited in its ability to allow for direct human interaction with physical objects to modify fabrication instructions within the MR environment. This research integrates user interactions with physical objects through real-time gesture recognition as input to modify, update or generate new digital information enabling reciprocal stimuli between the physical and the virtual environment. Consequently, the digital environment is generative of the user's provided interaction with physical objects to allow seamless feedback in the fabrication process.

Recent studies indicate that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities. However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity. Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional deep learning-based gesture recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input representations for gestures.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges remain in developing systems that respond quickly and reliably to user intent, across different subjects and without requiring time-consuming calibration. In this work, we propose a framework for EMG-based intent detection that addresses these challenges. Unlike traditional gesture recognition models that wait until a gesture is completed before classifying it, our approach uses a segmentation strategy to assign intent labels at every timestep as the gesture unfolds. We introduce a novel masked modeling strategy that aligns muscle activations with their corresponding user intents, enabling rapid onset detection and stable tracking of ongoing gestures. In evaluations against baseline methods, considering both accuracy and stability for device control, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot transfer conditions, demonstrating its potential for wearable robotics and next-generation prosthetic systems.

To process this information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely through tactile input.</p></details> |  | None |

Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important semantic gesture information. Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words unfold. Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired individuals.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB. The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition. DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB). The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and robustness across diverse datasets and architectures.

Our light-sensing surface captures motion data through in-sensor computation. This data is then processed using a memristive system equipped with a HfO2-based synaptic device, coupled with a winner-take-all (WTA) circuit, tailored for low-power motion classification tasks. We validate our end-to-end system using four distinct human hand gestures - left-to-right, right-to-left, bottom-to-top, and top-to-bottom movements - to assess energy efficiency and classification robustness. Our experiments show that the system requires an average of only 4.17 nJ for taking our processed analog signal and mapping weights onto our memristive system and 0.952 nJ for testing per movement class, achieving 97.22% accuracy even under 5% noise interference. A key advantage of our proposed architecture is its low energy requirement, enabling the integration of energy-harvesting solutions such as solar power for sustainable autonomous operation. Additionally, our approach enhances data privacy by processing data locally, reducing the need for external data transmission and storage.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was published in the 2024 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)</p></details> | None |
| **[Conversational Interfaces for Parametric Conceptual Architectural Design: Integrating Mixed Reality with LLM-driven Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06066v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed reality (MR) environments offer embodied spatial interaction, providing intuitive 3D manipulation capabilities that enhance the conceptual design process. Parametric modeling, a powerful and advanced architectural design method, enables the generation of complex, optimized geometries. However, its integration into MR environments remains limited due to precision constraints and unsuitable input modalities. Existing MR tools prioritize spatial interaction but lack the control and expressiveness required for parametric workflows, particularly for designers without formal programming backgrounds. We address this gap by introducing a novel conversational MR interface that combines speech input, gesture recognition, and a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system to support intuitive parametric modeling. Our system dynamically manages parameter states, resolves ambiguous commands through conversation and contextual prompting, and enables real-time model manipulation within immersive environments. We demonstrate how this approach reduces cognitive and operational barriers in early-stage design tasks, allowing users to refine and explore their design space. This work expands the role of MR to a generative design platform, supporting programmatic thinking in design tasks through natural, embodied interaction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Tuning Video Transformers for Word-Level Bangla Sign Language: A Comparative Analysis for Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04367v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT, and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in 9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401 sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets, including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set, while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics) achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60 dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Using custom-built plant sensors and machine learning classification, we demonstrate that plants generate distinct bioelectric signals correlating with human proximity, emotional states, and physiological conditions. A deep learning model based on ResNet50 architecture achieved 97% accuracy in classifying human emotional states through plant voltage spectrograms, while control models with shuffled labels achieved only 30% accuracy. This study synthesizes findings from multiple experiments spanning 2020-2025, including individual recognition (66% accuracy), eurythmic gesture detection, stress prediction, and responses to human voice and movement. We propose that these phenomena represent evolved anti-herbivory early warning systems, where plants detect approaching animals through bioelectric field changes before physical contact. Our results challenge conventional understanding of plant sensory capabilities and suggest practical applications in agriculture, healthcare, and human-plant interaction research.</p></details> |  | None |

Current gesture recognition methods are mostly limited to short-range interactions, reducing their utility in scenarios demanding robust assistive communication from afar. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach designed specifically for assistive robotics, enabling dynamic gesture recognition at extended distances of up to 30 meters, thereby significantly improving accessibility and quality of life. Our proposed Distance-aware Gesture Network (DiG-Net) effectively combines Depth-Conditioned Deformable Alignment (DADA) blocks with Spatio-Temporal Graph modules, enabling robust processing and classification of gesture sequences captured under challenging conditions, including significant physical attenuation, reduced resolution, and dynamic gesture variations commonly experienced in real-world assistive environments. We further introduce the Radiometric Spatio-Temporal Depth Attenuation Loss (RSTDAL), shown to enhance learning and strengthen model robustness across varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks, achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.3% on a diverse dataset with challenging hyper-range gestures. By effectively interpreting gestures from considerable distances, DiG-Net significantly enhances the usability of assistive robots in home healthcare, industrial safety, and remote assistance scenarios, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions for users regardless of physical limitations</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18413</p></details> | None |
| **[Data-Free Class-Incremental Gesture Recognition with Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20049v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gesture recognition is an important research area in the field of computer vision. Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP), Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy (TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore, the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features. Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of mean global accuracy, respectively.

Multitask learning typically achieves this by jointly training a single deep neural network to learn shared representations, providing efficiency and improving generalization. Although action and gesture recognition are closely related tasks, since they focus on body and hand movements, current state-of-the-art methods handle them separately. In this paper, we show that employing a multi-task learning paradigm for action and gesture recognition results in more efficient, robust and generalizable visual representations, by leveraging the synergies between these tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple action and gesture datasets demonstrate that handling actions and gestures in a single architecture can achieve better performance for both tasks in comparison to their single-task learning variants.</p></details> |  | None |

This research conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of vision-based hand gesture detection methodologies tailored for UAV Control. The existing gesture recognition approaches involving cropping, zooming, and color-based segmentation, do not work well for this kind of applications in dynamic conditions and suffer in performance with increasing distance and environmental noises. We propose to use a novel approach leveraging hand landmarks drawing and classification for gesture recognition based UAV control. With experimental results we show that our proposed method outperforms the other existing methods in terms of accuracy, noise resilience, and efficacy across varying distances, thus providing robust control decisions. However, implementing the deep learning based compute intensive gesture recognition algorithms on the UAV's onboard computer is significantly challenging in terms of performance. Hence, we propose to use a edge-computing based framework to offload the heavier computing tasks, thus achieving closed-loop real-time performance. With implementation over AirSim simulator as well as over a real-world UAV, we showcase the advantage of our end-to-end gesture recognition based UAV control system.</p></details> |  | None |

While professional guidelines emphasize proper handwashing to reduce the risk of viral infections, surveys reveal that adherence to these recommendations remains low. To address this gap, we propose UWash, a wearable solution leveraging smartwatches to evaluate handwashing procedures, aiming to raise awareness and cultivate high-quality handwashing habits. We frame the task of handwashing assessment as an action segmentation problem, similar to those in computer vision, and introduce a simple yet efficient two-stream UNet-like network to achieve this goal. Experiments involving 51 subjects demonstrate that UWash achieves 92.27% accuracy in handwashing gesture recognition, an error of <0.5 seconds in onset/offset detection, and an error of <5 points in gesture scoring under user-dependent settings. The system also performs robustly in user-independent and user-independent-location-independent evaluations. Remarkably, UWash maintains high performance in real-world tests, including evaluations with 10 random passersby at a hospital 9 months later and 10 passersby in an in-the-wild test conducted 2 years later. UWash is the first system to score handwashing quality based on gesture sequences, offering actionable guidance for improving daily hand hygiene.

While the recent asynchronous-to-synchronous (A2S) paradigm aims to bridge this gap by asynchronously encoding events into learned representations for ML pipelines, existing A2S approaches often sacrifice representation expressivity and generalizability compared to dense, synchronous methods. This paper introduces EVA (EVent Asynchronous representation learning), a novel A2S framework to generate highly expressive and generalizable event-by-event representations. Inspired by the analogy between events and language, EVA uniquely adapts advances from language modeling in linear attention and self-supervised learning for its construction. In demonstration, EVA outperforms prior A2S methods on recognition tasks (DVS128-Gesture and N-Cars), and represents the first A2S framework to successfully master demanding detection tasks, achieving a remarkable 47.7 mAP on the Gen1 dataset. These results underscore EVA's transformative potential for advancing real-time event-based vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

However, current approaches of Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) often face challenges such as low data quality and variability in gesturing speed. This paper introduces a comprehensive model training pipeline for ISLR designed to accommodate the distinctive characteristics and constraints of the Sign Language (SL) domain. The constructed pipeline incorporates carefully selected image and video augmentations to tackle the challenges of low data quality and varying sign speeds. Including an additional regression head combined with IoU-balanced classification loss enhances the model's awareness of the gesture and simplifies capturing temporal information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the developed training pipeline easily adapts to different datasets and architectures. Additionally, the ablation study shows that each proposed component expands the potential to consider ISLR task specifics.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and deep learning technology, visual-based interaction has gradually replaced traditional input devices and become an important way for intelligent systems to interact with users. The DeepSORT algorithm can achieve accurate target tracking in dynamic environments by combining Kalman filters and deep learning feature extraction methods. It is especially suitable for complex scenes with multi-target tracking and fast movements. This study experimentally verifies the superior performance of DeepSORT in gesture recognition and tracking. It can accurately capture and track the user's gesture trajectory and is superior to traditional tracking methods in terms of real-time and accuracy. In addition, this study also combines gesture recognition experiments to evaluate the recognition ability and feedback response of the DeepSORT algorithm under different gestures (such as sliding, clicking, and zooming). The experimental results show that DeepSORT can not only effectively deal with target occlusion and motion blur but also can stably track in a multi-target environment, achieving a smooth user interaction experience. Finally, this paper looks forward to the future development direction of intelligent human-computer interaction systems based on visual tracking and proposes future research focuses such as algorithm optimization, data fusion, and multimodal interaction in order to promote a more intelligent and personalized interactive experience.

However, while these systems typically perform well in controlled laboratory settings, their usability in real-world applications is compromised by declining performance during real-time control. This decline is largely due to goal-directed behaviors that are not captured in static, offline scenarios. To address this issue, we use \textit{Context Informed Incremental Learning} (CIIL) - marking its first deployment in an object-manipulation scenario - to continuously adapt the classifier using contextual cues. Nine participants without upper limb differences completed a functional task in a virtual reality (VR) environment involving transporting objects with life-like grips. We compared two scenarios: one where the classifier was adapted in real-time using contextual information, and the other using a traditional open-loop approach without adaptation. The CIIL-based approach not only enhanced task success rates and efficiency, but also reduced the perceived workload by 7.1 %, despite causing a 5.8 % reduction in offline classification accuracy. This study highlights the potential of real-time contextualized adaptation to enhance user experience and usability of EMG-based systems for practical, goal-oriented applications, crucial elements towards their long-term adoption.

FoodTrack estimates food volume directly, without relying on intake gestures or fixed assumptions about bite size, offering a more accurate and adaptable solution for tracking food consumption.

This paper presents a fuzzy logic approach that employs a Granular Linguistic Model of Phenomena integrated with multimodal analysis to evaluate soft skills in undergraduate students. By leveraging computational perceptions, this approach enables a structured breakdown of complex soft skill expressions, capturing nuanced behaviours with high granularity and addressing their inherent uncertainties, thereby enhancing interpretability and reliability. Experiments were conducted with undergraduate students using a developed tool that assesses soft skills such as decision-making, communication, and creativity. This tool identifies and quantifies subtle aspects of human interaction, such as facial expressions and gesture recognition. The findings reveal that the framework effectively consolidates multiple data inputs to produce meaningful and consistent assessments of soft skills, showing that integrating multiple modalities into the evaluation process significantly improves the quality of soft skills scores, making the assessment work transparent and understandable to educational stakeholders.</p></details> |  | None |

The content is intended for early dissemination and academic discussion. The final version may differ upon formal publication. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution reshapes industrial paradigms, human-robot collaboration (HRC) has transitioned from a desirable capability to an operational necessity. In response, collaborative robots (Cobots) are evolving beyond repetitive tasks toward adaptive, semantically informed interaction with humans and environments. This paper surveys five foundational pillars enabling this transformation: semantic-level perception, cognitive action planning, explainable learning and control, safety-aware motion design, and multimodal human intention recognition. We examine the role of semantic mapping in transforming spatial data into meaningful context, and explore cognitive planning frameworks that leverage this context for goal-driven decision-making. Additionally, we analyze explainable reinforcement learning methods, including policy distillation and attention mechanisms, which enhance interpretability and trust. Safety is addressed through force-adaptive control and risk-aware trajectory planning, while seamless human interaction is supported via gaze and gesture-based intent recognition. Despite these advancements, challenges such as perception-action disjunction, real-time explainability limitations, and incomplete human trust persist. To address these, we propose a unified Cognitive Synergy Architecture, integrating all modules into a cohesive framework for truly human-centric cobot collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 16 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

To address these, we developed an interactive control strategy that assists the human operator by predicting their motion plan at both high and low levels. At the high level, a surgeme recognition system is employed through a Transformer-based real-time gesture classification model to dynamically adapt to the operator's actions, while at the low level, a Confidence-based Intention Assimilation Controller adjusts robot actions based on user intent and shared control paradigms. The system is built around a robotic suturing task, supported by sensors that capture the kinematics of the robot and task dynamics. Experiments across users with varying skill levels demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing statistically significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional teleoperation.</p></details> |  | None |

Typically, models deployed on immersive computing devices are static and limited to their default set of classes. The goal of our research is to provide users and developers with the capability to personalize their experience by adding new action classes to their device models continually. Importantly, a user should be able to add new classes in a low-shot and efficient manner, while this process should not require storing or replaying any of user's sensitive training data. We formalize this problem as privacy-aware few-shot continual action recognition. Towards this end, we propose POET: Prompt-Offset Tuning. While existing prompt tuning approaches have shown great promise for continual learning of image, text, and video modalities; they demand access to extensively pretrained transformers. Breaking away from this assumption, POET demonstrates the efficacy of prompt tuning a significantly lightweight backbone, pretrained exclusively on the base class data. We propose a novel spatio-temporal learnable prompt offset tuning approach, and are the first to apply such prompt tuning to Graph Neural Networks. We contribute two new benchmarks for our new problem setting in human action recognition: (i) NTU RGB+D dataset for activity recognition, and (ii) SHREC-2017 dataset for hand gesture recognition. We find that POET consistently outperforms comprehensive benchmarks.

Sign language recognition (SLR) systems aim to recognize sign gestures and translate them into spoken language. One of the main challenges in SLR is the scarcity of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach for SLR (SSLR), employing a pseudo-label method to annotate unlabeled samples. The sign gestures are represented using pose information that encodes the signer's skeletal joint points. This information is used as input for the Transformer backbone model utilized in the proposed approach. To demonstrate the learning capabilities of SSL across various labeled data sizes, several experiments were conducted using different percentages of labeled data with varying numbers of classes. The performance of the SSL approach was compared with a fully supervised learning-based model on the WLASL-100 dataset.

However, the limited scale of radar datasets hinders the performance. Existing synthetic data generation methods fall short in two key areas. On the one hand, modeling-based approaches fail to accurately simulate the wave propagation and reflection at the hand-gesture level, facing unique complexities such as diffraction and occlusion. On the other hand, generative model-based methods are hard to converge while radar data is limited, lacking interpretability, and sometimes fail to produce kinematically plausible results. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid spectrum synthetic framework leveraging visual hand gesture data. It combines a cylinder mesh-based hand reflection model with a small-scale neural network called RadarWeightNet, which focuses on assigning weights to simulated signals. Our framework addresses two key challenges: achieving accurate simulation of complex hand geometry and bridging the simulation-to-real gap in a data-driven manner while preserving interpretability, which balances physical accuracy with machine learning adaptability. We tested our framework under extreme scenarios where radar data is scarce. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid framework, achieving up to 63% SSIM in synthetic performance and up to 30% improvement in classification performance in few-shot learning.</p></details> |  | None |

The spiking mechanism facilitates sparse encoding, enabling spatial and temporal data to be represented in a discrete manner. However, SNNs still lag behind artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of performance and computational efficiency. One major challenge in SNNs is the timestep-wise iterative update of neuronal states, which makes it difficult to achieve an optimal trade-off among accuracy, latency, and training cost. Although some methods perform well with shorter timesteps, few propose strategies to overcome such constraint effectively. Moreover, many recent SNN advancements rely on either optimizations tailored to specific architectures or a collection of specialized neuron-level strategies. While these approaches can enhance performance, they often lead to increased computational expense and restrict their application to particular architectures or modalities. This leaves room for further exploration of simple, universal, and structure-agnostic strategies that could offer broader applicability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2), a novel state update mechanism for spiking neurons. Inspired by skip connections in deep networks, AMP2 incorporates the membrane potential of neurons into network, eliminating the need for iterative updates. Our method achieves significant improvements across various 3D modalities, including 3D point clouds and event streams, boosting Spiking PointNet's accuracy on ModelNet40 from 87.36% to 89.74% and surpassing ANN PointNet in recognition accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Time Frequency Analysis of EMG Signal for Gesture Recognition using Fine grained Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14708v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromyography (EMG) based hand gesture recognition converts forearm muscle activity into control commands for prosthetics, rehabilitation, and human computer interaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to EMG-based hand gesture recognition that uses fine-grained classification and presents XMANet, which unifies low-level local and high level semantic cues through cross layer mutual attention among shallow to deep CNN experts. Using stacked spectrograms and scalograms derived from the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform (WT), we benchmark XMANet against ResNet50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetB0. Experimental results on the Grabmyo dataset indicate that, using STFT, the proposed XMANet model outperforms the baseline ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV3, and DenseNet121 models with improvement of approximately 1.72%, 4.38%, 5.10%, and 2.53%, respectively. When employing the WT approach, improvements of around 1.57%, 1.88%, 1.46%, and 2.05% are observed over the same baselines. Similarly, on the FORS EMG dataset, the XMANet(ResNet50) model using STFT shows an improvement of about 5.04% over the baseline ResNet50. In comparison, the XMANet(DenseNet121) and XMANet(MobileNetV3) models yield enhancements of approximately 4.11% and 2.81%, respectively. Moreover, when using WT, the proposed XMANet achieves gains of around 4.26%, 9.36%, 5.72%, and 6.09% over the baseline ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetB0 models, respectively. These results confirm that XMANet consistently improves performance across various architectures and signal processing techniques, demonstrating the strong potential of fine grained features for accurate and robust EMG classification.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to less capable ML models that can be embedded in resource-limited devices, use cases are limited to simple inference tasks such as visual keyword spotting, gesture recognition, and predictive analytics. In this context, the Hierarchical Inference (HI) system has emerged as a promising solution that augments the capabilities of the local ML by offloading selected samples to an edge server or cloud for remote ML inference. Existing works demonstrate through simulation that HI improves accuracy. However, they do not account for the latency and energy consumption on the device, nor do they consider three key heterogeneous dimensions that characterize ML systems: hardware, network connectivity, and models. In contrast, this paper systematically compares the performance of HI with on-device inference based on measurements of accuracy, latency, and energy for running embedded ML models on five devices with different capabilities and three image classification datasets. For a given accuracy requirement, the HI systems we designed achieved up to 73% lower latency and up to 77% lower device energy consumption than an on-device inference system. The key to building an efficient HI system is the availability of small-size, reasonably accurate on-device models whose outputs can be effectively differentiated for samples that require remote inference. Despite the performance gains, HI requires on-device inference for all samples, which adds a fixed overhead to its latency and energy consumption. Therefore, we design a hybrid system, Early Exit with HI (EE-HI), and demonstrate that compared to HI, EE-HI reduces the latency by up to 59.7% and lowers the device's energy consumption by up to 60.4%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Breaking the Barriers: Video Vision Transformers for Word-Level Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07792v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language is a fundamental means of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) community, enabling nuanced expression through gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. Despite its critical role in facilitating interaction within the DHH population, significant barriers persist due to the limited fluency in sign language among the hearing population. Overcoming this communication gap through automatic sign language recognition (SLR) remains a challenge, particularly at a dynamic word-level, where temporal and spatial dependencies must be effectively recognized. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown potential in SLR, they are computationally intensive and have difficulties in capturing global temporal dependencies between video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) model for word-level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Transformer models make use of self-attention mechanisms to effectively capture global relationships across spatial and temporal dimensions, which makes them suitable for complex gesture recognition tasks. The VideoMAE model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 75.58% on the WLASL100 dataset, highlighting its strong performance compared to traditional CNNs with 65.89%. Our study demonstrates that transformer-based architectures have great potential to advance SLR, overcome communication barriers and promote the inclusion of DHH individuals.</p></details> |  | None |

Their ability to process event-driven inputs, such as data from dynamic vision sensors (DVS), further enhances their applicability to edge computing tasks. However, the resource constraints of edge hardware necessitate techniques like weight quantization, which reduce the memory footprint of SNNs while preserving accuracy. Despite its importance, existing quantization methods typically focus on synaptic weights quantization without taking account of other critical parameters, such as scaling neuron firing thresholds. To address this limitation, we present the first benchmark for the DVS gesture recognition task using SNNs optimized for the many-core neuromorphic chip SpiNNaker2. Our study evaluates two quantization pipelines for fixed-point computations. The first approach employs post training quantization (PTQ) with percentile-based threshold scaling, while the second uses quantization aware training (QAT) with adaptive threshold scaling. Both methods achieve accurate 8-bit on-chip inference, closely approximating 32-bit floating-point performance. Additionally, our baseline SNNs perform competitively against previously reported results without specialized techniques. These models are deployed on SpiNNaker2 using the neuromorphic intermediate representation (NIR). Ultimately, we achieve 94.13% classification accuracy on-chip, demonstrating the SpiNNaker2's potential for efficient, low-energy neuromorphic computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables, Conference-2025 Neuro Inspired Computational Elements (NICE)</p></details> | None |

Toward such a socially acceptable Human-Robot Interaction, we conducted a study ($N=24$) in an AR-simulated context of a coffee chat.

Our findings reveal common patterns of social cues over intentions, the effects of robot morphology on social cue position and conversational role on social cue complexity, and users' rationale in choosing social cues. We offer insights into understanding social cues concerning perceptions of robots, cognitive load, and social context. Additionally, we discuss design considerations on approaching, social cue recognition, and response strategies for future service robots.</p></details> | CHI '25 | None |

However, the current technology still has problems like insufficient sensitivity and limited durability, which hinder its wide application. This paper presents a highly sensitive, modular, and flexible capacitive sensor based on line-shaped electrodes and liquid metal (EGaIn), integrated into a sensor module tailored to the human hand's anatomy. The proposed system independently captures bending information from each finger joint, while additional measurements between adjacent fingers enable the recording of subtle variations in inter-finger spacing. This design enables accurate gesture recognition and dynamic hand morphological reconstruction of complex movements using point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our classifier based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves an accuracy of 99.15% across 30 gestures. Meanwhile, a transformer-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) accurately reconstructs dynamic hand shapes with an Average Distance (AD) of 2.076\pm3.231 mm, with the reconstruction accuracy at individual key points surpassing SOTA benchmarks by 9.7% to 64.9%. The proposed glove shows excellent accuracy, robustness and scalability in gesture recognition and hand reconstruction, making it a promising solution for next-generation HCI systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current external tools applicable for learning music theory through writing when human instruction is unavailable are either limited in feedback, lacking a written modality, or assuming already strong familiarity of music theory concepts. In this paper, we describe Maestoso, an educational tool for novice learners to learn music theory through sketching practice of quizzed music structures. Maestoso first automatically recognizes students' sketched input of quizzed concepts, then relies on existing sketch and gesture recognition techniques to automatically recognize the input, and finally generates instructor-emulated feedback. From our evaluations, we demonstrate that Maestoso performs reasonably well on recognizing music structure elements and that novice students can comfortably grasp introductory music theory in a single session.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome the lack of signal based time-varying feature problems, we propose a lightweight squeeze-excitation deep learning-based multi stream spatial temporal dynamics time-varying feature extraction approach to build an effective sEMG-based hand gesture recognition system. Each branch of the proposed model was designed to extract hierarchical features, capturing both global and detailed spatial-temporal relationships to ensure feature effectiveness. The first branch, utilizing a Bidirectional-TCN (Bi-TCN), focuses on capturing long-term temporal dependencies by modelling past and future temporal contexts, providing a holistic view of gesture dynamics. The second branch, incorporating a 1D Convolutional layer, separable CNN, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, efficiently extracts spatial-temporal features while emphasizing critical feature channels, enhancing feature relevance. The third branch, combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), captures bidirectional temporal relationships and time-varying patterns. Outputs from all branches are fused using concatenation to capture subtle variations in the data and then refined with a channel attention module, selectively focusing on the most informative features while improving computational efficiency. The proposed model was tested on the Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB5 datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 96.41%, 92.40%, and 93.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of the system to handle complex sEMG dynamics, offering advancements in prosthetic limb control and human-machine interface technologies with significant implications for assistive technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose CLIP sign language adaptation (CLIP-SLA), a novel CSLR framework that leverages the powerful pre-trained visual encoder from the CLIP model to sign language tasks through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We introduce two variants, SLA-Adapter and SLA-LoRA, which integrate PEFT modules into the CLIP visual encoder, enabling fine-tuning with minimal trainable parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed frameworks is validated on four datasets: Phoenix2014, Phoenix2014-T, CSL-Daily, and Isharah-500, where both CLIP-SLA variants outperformed several SOTA models with fewer trainable parameters. Extensive ablation studies emphasize the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methods with different vision-language models for CSLR. These findings showcase the potential of adapting large-scale pre-trained models for scalable and efficient CSLR, which pave the way for future advancements in sign language understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches face difficulties adequately capturing the intrinsic connections between the modalities and overlooking the corresponding semantic representations of intent. To address these limitations, we present the Anchor-based Multimodal Embedding with Semantic Synchronization (A-MESS) framework. We first design an Anchor-based Multimodal Embedding (A-ME) module that employs an anchor-based embedding fusion mechanism to integrate multimodal inputs. Furthermore, we develop a Semantic Synchronization (SS) strategy with the Triplet Contrastive Learning pipeline, which optimizes the process by synchronizing multimodal representation with label descriptions produced by the large language model. Comprehensive experiments indicate that our A-MESS achieves state-of-the-art and provides substantial insight into multimodal representation and downstream tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 | None |
| **[UAC: Uncertainty-Aware Calibration of Neural Networks for Gesture Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02895v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has the potential to impact safety and efficiency in safety-critical domains such as construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. For example, using sensor data from wearable devices, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), human gestures can be detected while maintaining privacy, thereby ensuring that safety protocols are followed. However, strict safety requirements in these domains have limited the adoption of AI, since accurate calibration of predicted probabilities and robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) data is necessary. This paper proposes UAC (Uncertainty-Aware Calibration), a novel two-step method to address these challenges in IMU-based gesture recognition. First, we present an uncertainty-aware gesture network architecture that predicts both gesture probabilities and their associated uncertainties from IMU data. This uncertainty is then used to calibrate the probabilities of each potential gesture. Second, an entropy-weighted expectation of predictions over multiple IMU data windows is used to improve accuracy while maintaining correct calibration. Our method is evaluated using three publicly available IMU datasets for gesture detection and is compared to three state-of-the-art calibration methods for neural networks: temperature scaling, entropy maximization, and Laplace approximation. UAC outperforms existing methods, achieving improved accuracy and calibration in both OOD and in-distribution scenarios. Moreover, we find that, unlike our method, none of the state-of-the-art methods significantly improve the calibration of IMU-based gesture recognition models. In conclusion, our work highlights the advantages of uncertainty-aware calibration of neural networks, demonstrating improvements in both calibration and accuracy for gesture detection using IMU data.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures | None |

These systems, leveraging FMCW signals, have shown success in human-centric applications like localization, gesture recognition, and so on. However, comprehensive mmWave datasets for diverse applications are scarce, often constrained by pre-processed signatures (e.g., point clouds or RA heatmaps) and inconsistent annotation formats. To overcome these limitations, we propose mmGen, a novel and generalized framework tailored for full-scene mmWave signal generation. By constructing physical signal transmission models, mmGen synthesizes human-reflected and environment-reflected mmWave signals from the constructed 3D meshes. Additionally, we incorporate methods to account for material properties, antenna gains, and multipath reflections, enhancing the realism of the synthesized signals. We conduct extensive experiments using a prototype system with commercial mmWave devices and Kinect sensors. The results show that the average similarity of Range-Angle and micro-Doppler signatures between the synthesized and real-captured signals across three different environments exceeds 0.91 and 0.89, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness and practical applicability of mmGen.</p></details> | IEEE INFOCOM 2025 | None |

This research area presents a complex challenge in computer vision because of the rapid and intricate movements inherent in sign languages, which encompass hand gestures, body postures, and even facial expressions. Recently, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to handle variations in subjects and backgrounds independently. However, current skeleton-based SLR methods exhibit three limitations: 1) they often neglect the importance of realistic hand poses, where most studies train SLR models on non-realistic skeletal representations; 2) they tend to assume complete data availability in both training or inference phases, and capture intricate relationships among different body parts collectively; 3) these methods treat all sign glosses uniformly, failing to account for differences in complexity levels regarding skeletal representations. To enhance the realism of hand skeletal representations, we present a kinematic hand pose rectification method for enforcing constraints. Mitigating the impact of missing data, we propose a feature-isolated mechanism to focus on capturing local spatial-temporal context. This method captures the context concurrently and independently from individual features, thus enhancing the robustness of the SLR model. Additionally, to adapt to varying complexity levels of sign glosses, we develop an input-adaptive inference approach to optimise computational efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as evidenced by achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on WLASL100 and LSA64. For WLASL100, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 86.50\%, marking a relative improvement of 2.39% over the previous SOTA.

The current robotic surgical systems provide us with rich multi-modal data such as video and kinematics. While some recent works in multi-modal neural networks learn the relationships between vision and kinematics data, current approaches treat kinematics information as independent signals, with no underlying relation between tool-tip poses. However, instrument poses are geometrically related, and the underlying geometry can aid neural networks in learning gesture representation. Therefore, we propose combining motion invariant measures (curvature and torsion) with vision and kinematics data using a relational graph network to capture the underlying relations between different data streams. We show that gesture recognition improves when combining invariant signals with tool position, achieving 90.3\% frame-wise accuracy on the JIGSAWS suturing dataset. Our results show that motion invariant signals coupled with position are better representations of gesture motion compared to traditional position and quaternion representations. Our results highlight the need for geometric-aware modeling of kinematics for gesture recognition.</p></details> |  | None |

While event cameras show distinct advantages in handling high dynamic range with ultra-low power consumption, existing RGB-based architectures face inherent limitations in processing asynchronous event streams due to their synchronous frame-based nature. Moreover, from an egocentric perspective, event cameras record data that include events generated by both head movements and hand gestures, thereby increasing the complexity of gesture recognition. To address this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for event data processing, incorporating (1) a lightweight CNN with asymmetric depthwise convolutions to reduce parameters while preserving spatiotemporal features, (2) a plug-and-play state-space model as context block that decouples head movement noise from gesture dynamics, and (3) a parameter-free Bins-Temporal Shift Module (BSTM) that shifts features along bins and temporal dimensions to fuse sparse events efficiently. We further build the EgoEvGesture dataset, the first large-scale dataset for egocentric gesture recognition using event cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 62.7% accuracy in heterogeneous testing with only 7M parameters, 3.1% higher than state-of-the-art approaches. Notable misclassifications in freestyle motions stem from high inter-personal variability and unseen test patterns differing from training data.

This poses a challenge when reference frames vary due to different work cell layouts, imprecise frame calibrations, or other environmental changes. This paper investigated the use of invariant trajectory descriptors for robust hand palm motion gesture recognition under reference frame changes. First, a novel dataset of recorded Hand Palm Motion (HPM) gestures is introduced. The motion gestures in this dataset were specifically designed to be distinguishable without dependence on specific reference frames or directional cues. Afterwards, multiple invariant trajectory descriptor approaches were benchmarked to assess how their performances generalize to this novel HPM dataset. After this offline benchmarking, the best scoring approach is validated for online recognition by developing a real-time Proof of Concept (PoC). In this PoC, hand palm motion gestures were used to control the real-time movement of a manipulator arm. The PoC demonstrated a high recognition reliability in real-time operation, achieving an $F_1$-score of 92.3%. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the invariant descriptor approach as a standalone solution. Moreover, we believe that the invariant descriptor approach can also be utilized within other state-of-the-art pattern recognition and learning systems to improve their robustness against reference frame variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, this work has been submitted as a conference paper for consideration in the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), the content in this preprint is identical to the version submitted for peer review</p></details> | None |

Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) refers to the AI-driven process of automatically recognizing hand gestures and lip movements in CS, converting them into text. However, previous work often relies on complex fusion modules and training techniques. Additionally, due to the limited amount of data in CS, the extraction of hand features, as well as recognition modeling, has consistently been subpar, significantly limiting the effectiveness of ACSR. To address this issue, we have innovatively explored the capabilities of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in recognizing hand shapes and positions in CS. More precisely, we propose a new Semi Training-Free paradigm for ACSR, named STF-ACSR. This approach leverages zero-shot recognition of hand movements through the Chinese CS Prompt Module (CCSPM), which equipped a training-free keyframe filtering and customized prompt engineering based on MLLM. It then integrates the recognition results into the lip-reading model using a Minimalist Fusion Module (MFM), effectively achieving superior recognition results. Furthermore, specifically for this study, we have supplemented the existing dataset of 6 normal hearing CS cuers by recording additional data from 8 cuers with hearing impairments, resulting in a new mixed dataset. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that STF-ACSR significantly outperforms previous methods on both normal and hearing-impaired data. Implementation and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/STF_ACSR.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/DennisHgj/STF_ACSR) |

While hand gesture recognition in computer vision has advanced significantly, critical challenges remain in creating systems that are intuitive, adaptable across diverse users and environments, and energy-efficient enough for practical wearable applications. Our approach tackles these challenges through carefully selected microgestures: lateral thumb swipes across the index finger (in both directions) and a double pinch between thumb and index fingertips. These human-centered interactions leverage natural hand movements, ensuring intuitive usability without requiring users to learn complex command sequences. To overcome variability in users and environments, we developed a novel simulation methodology that enables comprehensive domain sampling without extensive real-world data collection. Our power-optimised architecture maintains exceptional performance, achieving F1 scores above 80\% on benchmark datasets featuring diverse users and environments. The resulting models operate at just 6-8 mW when exploiting the Qualcomm Snapdragon Hexagon DSP, with our 2-channel implementation exceeding 70\% F1 accuracy and our 6-channel model surpassing 80\% F1 accuracy across all gesture classes in user studies. These results were achieved using only synthetic training data. This improves on the state-of-the-art for F1 accuracy by 20\% with a power reduction 25x when using DSP. This advancement brings deploying ultra-low-power vision systems in wearable devices closer and opens new possibilities for seamless human-computer interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures.

However traditional methods often require data transmission to centralized processing unit with substantial computational resources after collecting it from edge devices. Neuromorphic computing is an emerging field that seeks to design specialized hardware for computing systems inspired by the structure, function, and dynamics of the human brain, offering significant advantages in latency and power consumption. This paper explores a novel neuromorphic implementation approach for gesture recognition by extracting spatiotemporal spiking information from surface electromyography (sEMG) data in an event-driven manner. At the same time, the network was designed by implementing a simple-structured and hardware-friendly Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) framework called Rotating Neuron Reservoir (RNR) within the domain of Spiking neural network (SNN). The spiking RNR (sRNR) is promising to pipeline an innovative solution to compact embedded wearable systems, enabling low-latency, real-time processing directly at the sensor level. The proposed system was validated by an open-access large-scale sEMG database and achieved an average classification accuracy of 74.6\% and 80.3\% using a classical machine learning classifier and a delta learning rule algorithm respectively. While the delta learning rule could be fully spiking and implementable on neuromorphic chips, the proposed gesture recognition system demonstrates the potential for near-sensor low-latency processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, journal</p></details> | None |

We present Maestro, a RISC-V SoC with unified Vector-Tensor Unit (VTU) and memory-coupled Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) accelerators targeting edge processing for wearable ultrasound devices, fabricated using low-cost TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The VTU achieves peak 302GFLOPS/W and 19.8GFLOPS at FP16, while the multi-precision 16/32-bit floating-point FFT accelerator delivers peak 60.6GFLOPS/W and 3.6GFLOPS at FP16, We evaluate Maestro on a US-based gesture recognition task, achieving 1.62GFLOPS in signal processing at 26.68GFLOPS/W, and 19.52GFLOPS in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) workloads at 298.03GFLOPS/W. Compared to a state-of-the-art SoC with a similar mission profile, Maestro achieves a 5x speedup while consuming only 12mW, with an energy consumption of 2.5mJ in a wearable US channel preprocessing and ML-based postprocessing pipeline.</p></details> |  | None |

In interaction, effectively obtaining high-quality demonstrations remains a challenge. In this work, we develop an immersive virtual reality (VR) demonstration system that allows operators to perceive stereoscopic environments. This system ensures "the operator's visual perception matches the robot's sensory input" and "the operator's actions directly determine the robot's behaviors" - as if the operator replaces the robot in human interaction engagements. We propose a prediction-driven latency compensation strategy to reduce robotic reaction delays and enhance interaction fluency. FABG naturally acquires human interactive behaviors and subconscious motions driven by intuition, eliminating manual behavior scripting. We deploy FABG on a real-world 25-degree-of-freedom (DoF) humanoid robot, validating its effectiveness through four fundamental interaction tasks: expression response, dynamic gaze, foveated attention, and gesture recognition, supported by data collection and policy training.

In this work, we propose One-Shot Gesture Recognition (OSG), a novel method that enables real-time, pose-based, temporal gesture recognition underwater from a single demonstration, eliminating the need for extensive dataset collection or model retraining. OSG leverages shape-based classification techniques, including Hu moments, Zernike moments, and Fourier descriptors, to robustly recognize gestures in visually-challenging underwater environments. Our system achieves high accuracy on real-world underwater data and operates efficiently on embedded hardware commonly found on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), demonstrating its feasibility for deployment on-board robots. Compared to deep learning approaches, OSG is lightweight, computationally efficient, and highly adaptable, making it ideal for diver-to-robot communication. We evaluate OSG's performance on an augmented gesture dataset and real-world underwater video data, comparing its accuracy against deep learning methods. Our results show OSG's potential to enhance U-HRI by enabling the immediate deployment of user-defined gestures without the constraints of predefined gesture languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IROS2025</p></details> | None |

The streaming gesture recognition framework, Duo Streamers, proposed in this paper, addresses these challenges through a three-stage sparse recognition mechanism, an RNN-lite model with an external hidden state, and specialized training and post-processing pipelines, thereby making innovative progress in real-time performance and lightweight design. Experimental results show that Duo Streamers matches mainstream methods in accuracy metrics, while reducing the real-time factor by approximately 92.3%, i.e., delivering a nearly 13-fold speedup. In addition, the framework shrinks parameter counts to 1/38 (idle state) and 1/9 (busy state) compared to mainstream models. In summary, Duo Streamers not only offers an efficient and practical solution for streaming gesture recognition in resource-constrained devices but also lays a solid foundation for extended applications in multimodal and diverse scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, existing datasets primarily focus on elementary tasks like object pointing and pushing, limiting their applicability to complex domains. They prioritize simpler human command data but place less emphasis on training robots to correctly interpret tasks and respond appropriately. To address these gaps, we present the NatSGLD dataset, which was collected using a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method, where participants interacted with a robot they believed to be autonomous. NatSGLD records humans' multimodal commands (speech and gestures), each paired with a demonstration trajectory and a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that provides a ground-truth interpretation of the commanded tasks. This dataset serves as a foundational resource for research at the intersection of HRI and machine learning. By providing multimodal inputs and detailed annotations, NatSGLD enables exploration in areas such as multimodal instruction following, plan recognition, and human-advisable reinforcement learning from demonstrations. We release the dataset and code under the MIT License at https://www.snehesh.com/natsgld/ to support future HRI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2403.02274</p></details> | None |

Among various modalities, skeleton-based approaches have gained significant popularity, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing 3D temporal data while ensuring robustness to environmental variations. However, most existing works focus on segment-based recognition, making them unsuitable for real-time, continuous recognition scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel online recognition system designed for real-time skeleton sequence streaming. Our approach leverages a hybrid architecture combining Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (S-GCN) for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer-based Graph Encoder (TGE) for capturing temporal dependencies across frames. Additionally, we introduce a continual learning mechanism to enhance model adaptability to evolving data distributions, ensuring robust recognition in dynamic environments. We evaluate our method on the SHREC'21 benchmark dataset, demonstrating its superior performance in online hand gesture recognition. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly reduces false positive rates, making it a compelling solution for real-time applications. The proposed system can be seamlessly integrated into various domains, including human-robot collaboration and assistive technologies, where natural and intuitive interaction is crucial.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a generic video camera-aided convolutional neural network (CNN) based air-writing framework. Gestures are performed using a marker of fixed color in front of a generic video camera, followed by color-based segmentation to identify the marker and track the trajectory of the marker tip. A pre-trained CNN is then used to classify the gesture. The recognition accuracy is further improved using transfer learning with the newly acquired data. The performance of the system varies significantly on the illumination condition due to color-based segmentation. In a less fluctuating illumination condition, the system is able to recognize isolated unistroke numerals of multiple languages.

| **[Position and Rotation Invariant Sign Language Recognition from 3D Kinect Data with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12669v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language is a gesture-based symbolic communication medium among speech and hearing impaired people. It also serves as a communication bridge between non-impaired and impaired populations. Unfortunately, in most situations, a non-impaired person is not well conversant in such symbolic languages restricting the natural information flow between these two categories. Therefore, an automated translation mechanism that seamlessly translates sign language into natural language can be highly advantageous. In this paper, we attempt to perform recognition of 30 basic Indian sign gestures. Gestures are represented as temporal sequences of 3D maps (RGB + depth), each consisting of 3D coordinates of 20 body joints captured by the Kinect sensor. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as the classifier. To improve the classifier's performance, we use geometric transformation for the alignment correction of depth frames.

Despite advancements in ASR that address disfluencies, there has been little attention on integrating non-verbal communication methods, such as gestures, which individuals with language disorders substantially rely on to supplement their communication. Recognizing the need to interpret the latent meanings of visual information not captured by speech alone, we propose a gesture-aware ASR system utilizing a multimodal large language model with zero-shot learning for individuals with speech impairments. Our experiment results and analyses show that including gesture information significantly enhances semantic understanding. This study can help develop effective communication technologies, specifically designed to meet the unique needs of individuals with language impairments.</p></details> |  | None |

Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario.

However, wireless signals are sensitive to the surroundings. Various factors, e.g. environments, locations, and individuals, may induce extra impact on wireless propagation. Such a change can be regarded as a domain, in which the data distribution shifts. A vast majority of the sensing schemes are learning-based. They are dependent on the training domains, resulting in performance degradation in unseen domains. Researchers have proposed various solutions to address this issue. But these solutions leverage either semi-supervised or unsupervised domain adaptation techniques. They still require some data in the target domains and do not perform well in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a domain generalization framework DGSense, to eliminate the domain dependence problem in wireless sensing. The framework is a general solution working across diverse sensing tasks and wireless technologies. Once the sensing model is built, it can generalize to unseen domains without any data from the target domain. To achieve the goal, we first increase the diversity of the training set by a virtual data generator, and then extract the domain independent features via episodic training between the main feature extractor and the domain feature extractors. The feature extractors employ a pre-trained Residual Network (ResNet) with an attention mechanism for spatial features, and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) for temporal features. To demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of DGSense, we evaluated on WiFi gesture recognition, Millimeter Wave (mmWave) activity recognition, and acoustic fall detection. All the systems exhibited high generalization capability to unseen domains, including new users, locations, and environments, free of new data and retraining.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

However, a significant challenge in practical implementations of HD-sEMG-based models is the low accuracy of inter-session and inter-subject classification. Variability between sessions can reach up to 40% due to the inherent temporal variability of HD-sEMG signals. Targeting this challenge, the paper introduces the MoEMba framework, a novel approach leveraging Selective StateSpace Models (SSMs) to enhance HD-sEMG-based gesture recognition. The MoEMba framework captures temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions through channel attention techniques. Furthermore, wavelet feature modulation is integrated to capture multi-scale temporal and spatial relations, improving signal representation. Experimental results on the CapgMyo HD-sEMG dataset demonstrate that MoEMba achieves a balanced accuracy of 56.9%, outperforming its state-of-the-art counterparts. The proposed framework's robustness to session-to-session variability and its efficient handling of high-dimensional multivariate time series data highlight its potential for advancing HD-sEMG-powered HCI systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Individuals with hearing impairments often find communication challenging, necessitating the use of sign language. However, there are limited public services that offer such inclusivity. On the other hand, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) present promising solutions to overcome communication barriers faced by the deaf. This study aims to explore the application of AI in developing models for a simplified sign language translation app and dictionary, designed for integration into public service facilities, to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments, thereby enhancing inclusivity in public services. The researchers compared the performance of LSTM and 1D CNN + Transformer (1DCNNTrans) models for sign language recognition. Through rigorous testing and validation, it was found that the LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 94.67%, while the 1DCNNTrans model achieved an accuracy of 96.12%. Model performance evaluation indicated that although the LSTM exhibited lower inference latency, it showed weaknesses in classifying classes with similar keypoints. In contrast, the 1DCNNTrans model demonstrated greater stability and higher F1 scores for classes with varying levels of complexity compared to the LSTM model. Both models showed excellent performance, exceeding 90% validation accuracy and demonstrating rapid classification of 50 sign language gestures.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |

This characteristic introduces two novel challenges regarding micro-gestures that are worth rethinking. The first is whether strategies designed for other action recognition are entirely applicable to micro-gestures. The second is whether micro-gestures, as supplementary data, can provide additional insights for emotional understanding. In recognizing micro-gestures, we explored various augmentation strategies that take into account the subtle spatial and brief temporal characteristics of micro-gestures, often accompanied by repetitiveness, to determine more suitable augmentation methods. Considering the significance of temporal domain information for micro-gestures, we introduce a simple and efficient plug-and-play spatiotemporal balancing fusion method. We not only studied our method on the considered micro-gesture dataset but also conducted experiments on mainstream action datasets. The results show that our approach performs well in micro-gesture recognition and on other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous micro-gesture recognition methods. For emotional understanding based on micro-gestures, we construct complex emotional reasoning scenarios. Our evaluation, conducted with large language models, shows that micro-gestures play a significant and positive role in enhancing comprehensive emotional understanding. The scenarios we developed can be extended to other micro-gesture-based tasks such as deception detection and interviews. We confirm that our new insights contribute to advancing research in micro-gesture and emotional artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pr...</summary><p>We provide a link to the public release of the code and data in this new version</p></details> | None |

In response, we present advancements in XentricAI, an explainable hand gesture recognition (HGR) system designed to meet these regulatory requirements. XentricAI adresses fundamental challenges in HGR, such as the opacity of black-box models using explainable AI methods and the handling of distributional shifts in real-world data through transfer learning techniques. We extend an existing radar-based HGR dataset by adding 28,000 new gestures, with contributions from multiple users across varied locations, including 24,000 out-of-distribution gestures. Leveraging this real-world dataset, we enhance XentricAI's capabilities by integrating a variational autoencoder module for improved gesture anomaly detection, incorporating user-specific thresholding. This integration enables the identification of 11.50% more anomalous gestures. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a 97.5% sucess rate in characterizing these anomalies, significantly improving system explainability.

| **[Spatial Adaptation Layer: Interpretable Domain Adaptation For Biosignal Sensor Array Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08058v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning offers promising methods for processing signals recorded with wearable devices such as surface electromyography (sEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, in these applications, despite high within-session performance, intersession performance is hindered by electrode shift, a known issue across modalities. Existing solutions often require large and expensive datasets and/or lack robustness and interpretability. Thus, we propose the Spatial Adaptation Layer (SAL), which can be applied to any biosignal array model and learns a parametrized affine transformation at the input between two recording sessions. We also introduce learnable baseline normalization (LBN) to reduce baseline fluctuations. Tested on two HD-sEMG gesture recognition datasets, SAL and LBN outperformed standard fine-tuning on regular arrays, achieving competitive performance even with a logistic regressor, with orders of magnitude less, physically interpretable parameters. Our ablation study showed that forearm circumferential translations account for the majority of performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCNN...</summary><p>IJCNN(submitted), 6 pages</p></details> | None |

It determines gestures by monitoring current and power changes in different coils. The data processing includes noise removal, sorting, highpass filtering, and slicing. A Bayesian network and particle filtering are employed for motion tracking. Through experiments, this solution proves to have wide applications, high recognition accuracy, and low cost.

However, these bottom-facing cameras can sometimes be inconvenient and pose a risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information, such as private body parts or personal surroundings. To mitigate these issues, we introduce EgoHand. This system provides an alternative solution by integrating millimeter-wave radar and IMUs for hand gesture recognition, thereby offering users an additional option for gesture interaction that enhances privacy protection. To accurately recognize hand gestures, we devise a two-stage skeleton-based gesture recognition scheme. In the first stage, a novel end-to-end Transformer architecture is employed to estimate the coordinates of hand joints. Subsequently, these estimated joint coordinates are utilized for gesture recognition. Extensive experiments involving 10 subjects show that EgoHand can detect hand gestures with 90.8% accuracy. Furthermore, EgoHand demonstrates robust performance across a variety of cross-domain tests, including different users, dominant hands, body postures, and scenes.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> | None |

| **[Assessing the Acceptance of a Mid-Air Gesture Syntax for Smart Space Interaction: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04464v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article explores the use of a location-aware mid-air gesture-based command triplet syntax to interact with a smart space. The syntax, inspired by human language, is built as a vocative case with an imperative structure. In a sentence like 'Light, please switch on', the object being activated is invoked via making a gesture that mimics its initial letter/acronym (vocative, coincident with the sentence's elliptical subject). A geometrical or directional gesture then identifies the action (imperative verb) and may include an object feature or a second object with which to network (complement), which also represented by the initial or acronym letter. Technically, an interpreter relying on a trainable multidevice gesture recognition layer makes the pair/triplet syntax decoding possible. The recognition layer works on acceleration and position input signals from graspable (smartphone) and free-hand devices (smartwatch and external depth cameras), as well as a specific compiler. On a specific deployment at a Living Lab facility, the syntax has been instantiated via the use of a lexicon derived from English (with respect to the initial letters and acronyms). A within-subject analysis with twelve users has enabled the analysis of the syntax acceptance (in terms of usability, gesture agreement for actions over objects, and social acceptance) and technology preference of the gesture syntax within its three device implementations (graspable, wearable, and device-free ones). Participants express consensus regarding the simplicity of learning the syntax and its potential effectiveness in managing smart resources. Socially, participants favoured the Watch for outdoor activities and the Phone for home and work settings, underscoring the importance of social context in technology design. The Phone emerged as the preferred option for gesture recognition due to its efficiency and familiarity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Extraction Of Cumulative Blobs From Dynamic Gestures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04002v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gesture recognition is a perceptual user interface, which is based on CV technology that allows the computer to interpret human motions as commands, allowing users to communicate with a computer without the use of hands, thus making the mouse and keyboard superfluous. Gesture recognition's main weakness is a light condition because gesture control is based on computer vision, which heavily relies on cameras. These cameras are used to interpret gestures in 2D and 3D, so the extracted information can vary depending on the source of light. The limitation of the system cannot work in a dark environment. A simple night vision camera can be used as our camera for motion capture as they also blast out infrared light which is not visible to humans but can be clearly seen with a camera that has no infrared filter this majorly overcomes the limitation of systems which cannot work in a dark environment. So, the video stream from the camera is fed into a Raspberry Pi which has a Python program running OpenCV module which is used for detecting, isolating and tracking the path of dynamic gesture, then we use an algorithm of machine learning to recognize the pattern drawn and accordingly control the GPIOs of the raspberry pi to perform some activities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04783v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sound-Based Recognition of Touch Gestures and Emotions for Enhanced Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00038v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion recognition and touch gesture decoding are crucial for advancing human-robot interaction (HRI), especially in social environments where emotional cues and tactile perception play important roles. However, many humanoid robots, such as Pepper, Nao, and Furhat, lack full-body tactile skin, limiting their ability to engage in touch-based emotional and gesture interactions. In addition, vision-based emotion recognition methods usually face strict GDPR compliance challenges due to the need to collect personal facial data. To address these limitations and avoid privacy issues, this paper studies the potential of using the sounds produced by touching during HRI to recognise tactile gestures and classify emotions along the arousal and valence dimensions. Using a dataset of tactile gestures and emotional interactions from 28 participants with the humanoid robot Pepper, we design an audio-only lightweight touch gesture and emotion recognition model with only 0.24M parameters, 0.94MB model size, and 0.7G FLOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed sound-based touch gesture and emotion recognition model effectively recognises the arousal and valence states of different emotions, as well as various tactile gestures, when the input audio length varies. The proposed model is low-latency and achieves similar results as well-known pretrained audio neural networks (PANNs), but with much smaller FLOPs, parameters, and model size.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 | None |

A pyramidal hierarchy of multiscale features is extracted using the transformer multiscaled head attention model. The proposed model employs different attention dimensions for each head of the transformer which enables it to provide attention at the multiscale level. Further, in addition to single modality, recognition performance using multiple modalities is examined. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MsMHA-VTN with an overall accuracy of 88.22\% and 99.10\% on NVGesture and Briareo datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mouth Articulation-Based Anchoring for Improved Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19909v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a vital role in numerous practical applications. Traditional approaches to cross-corpus emotion transfer often concentrate on adapting acoustic features to align with different corpora, domains, or labels. However, acoustic features are inherently variable and error-prone due to factors like speaker differences, domain shifts, and recording conditions. To address these challenges, this study adopts a novel contrastive approach by focusing on emotion-specific articulatory gestures as the core elements for analysis. By shifting the emphasis on the more stable and consistent articulatory gestures, we aim to enhance emotion transfer learning in SER tasks. Our research leverages the CREMA-D and MSP-IMPROV corpora as benchmarks and it reveals valuable insights into the commonality and reliability of these articulatory gestures. The findings highlight mouth articulatory gesture potential as a better constraint for improving emotion recognition across different settings or domains.</p></details> |  | None |

In the fields of virtual reality, augmented reality and smart home, traditional input methods have gradually failed to meet the needs of users for interactive experience. As an intuitive and convenient interaction method, gestures have received more and more attention. This paper proposes a gesture recognition method based on a three-dimensional hand skeleton model. By simulating the three-dimensional spatial distribution of hand joints, a simplified hand skeleton structure is constructed. By connecting the palm and each finger joint, a dynamic and static gesture model of the hand is formed, which further improves the accuracy and efficiency of gesture recognition. Experimental results show that this method can effectively recognize various gestures and maintain high recognition accuracy and real-time response capabilities in different environments. In addition, combined with multimodal technologies such as eye tracking, the intelligence level of the gesture recognition system can be further improved, bringing a richer and more intuitive user experience. In the future, with the continuous development of computer vision, deep learning and multimodal interaction technology, natural interaction based on gestures will play an important role in a wider range of application scenarios and promote revolutionary progress in human-computer interaction.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models often struggle with generating anatomically accurate representations of human hands. The resulting images frequently exhibit issues such as incorrect numbers of fingers, unnatural twisting or interlacing of fingers, or blurred and indistinct hands. These issues stem from the inherent complexity of hand structures and the difficulty in aligning textual descriptions with precise visual depictions of hands. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named Hand1000 that enables the generation of realistic hand images with target gesture using only 1,000 training samples. The training of Hand1000 is divided into three stages with the first stage aiming to enhance the model's understanding of hand anatomy by using a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to extract gesture representation. The second stage further optimizes text embedding by incorporating the extracted hand gesture representation, to improve alignment between the textual descriptions and the generated hand images. The third stage utilizes the optimized embedding to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to generate realistic hand images. In addition, we construct the first publicly available dataset specifically designed for text-to-hand image generation. Based on the existing hand gesture recognition dataset, we adopt advanced image captioning models and LLaMA3 to generate high-quality textual descriptions enriched with detailed gesture information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hand1000 significantly outperforms existing models in producing anatomically correct hand images while faithfully representing other details in the text, such as faces, clothing, and colors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

Nevertheless, the significant challenge lies in obtaining large-scale, high-quality mmWave gesture datasets. To tackle this problem, we present iRadar, a novel cross-modal gesture recognition framework that employs Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data to synthesize the radar signals generated by the corresponding gestures. The key idea is to exploit the IMU signals, which are commonly available in contemporary wearable devices, to synthesize the radar signals that would be produced if the same gesture was performed in front of a mmWave radar. However, several technical obstacles must be overcome due to the differences between mmWave and IMU signals, the noisy gesture sensing of mmWave radar, and the dynamics of human gestures. Firstly, we develop a method for processing IMU and mmWave data to extract critical gesture features. Secondly, we propose a diffusion-based IMU-to-radar translation model that accurately transforms IMU data into mmWave data. Lastly, we devise a novel transformer model to enhance gesture recognition performance. We thoroughly evaluate iRadar, involving 18 gestures and 30 subjects in three scenarios, using five wearable devices. Experimental results demonstrate that iRadar consistently achieves 99.82% Top-3 accuracy across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

The deployment of DNNs on edge-devices, endowed with limited time and memory resources, requires designing lightweight and efficient variants of these networks. Pruning is one of the lightweight network design techniques that operate by removing unnecessary network parts, in a structured or an unstructured manner, including individual weights, neurons or even entire channels. Nonetheless, structured and unstructured pruning methods, when applied separately, may either be inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we devise a novel semi-structured method that discards the downsides of structured and unstructured pruning while gathering their upsides to some extent. The proposed solution is based on a differentiable cascaded parametrization which combines (i) a band-stop mechanism that prunes weights depending on their magnitudes, (ii) a weight-sharing parametrization that prunes connections either individually or group-wise, and (iii) a gating mechanism which arbitrates between different group-wise and entry-wise pruning. All these cascaded parametrizations are built upon a common latent tensor which is trained end-to-end by minimizing a classification loss and a surrogate tensor rank regularizer. Extensive experiments, conducted on the challenging tasks of action and hand-gesture recognition, show the clear advantage of our proposed semi-structured pruning approach against both structured and unstructured pruning, when taken separately, as well as the related work.</p></details> |  | None |

While professional guidelines emphasize proper handwashing to reduce the risk of viral infections, surveys reveal that adherence to these recommendations remains low. To address this gap, we propose UWash, a wearable solution leveraging smartwatches to evaluate handwashing procedures, aiming to raise awareness and cultivate high-quality handwashing habits. We frame the task of handwashing assessment as an action segmentation problem, similar to those in computer vision, and introduce a simple yet efficient two-stream UNet-like network to achieve this goal. Experiments involving 51 subjects demonstrate that UWash achieves 92.27% accuracy in handwashing gesture recognition, an error of <0.5 seconds in onset/offset detection, and an error of <5 points in gesture scoring under user-dependent settings. The system also performs robustly in user-independent and user-independent-location-independent evaluations. Remarkably, UWash maintains high performance in real-world tests, including evaluations with 10 random passersby at a hospital 9 months later and 10 passersby in an in-the-wild test conducted 2 years later. UWash is the first system to score handwashing quality based on gesture sequences, offering actionable guidance for improving daily hand hygiene.

Currently, prosthetic hands controlled by signals such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and electromyography (EMG) face difficulties in precisely recognizing the amputees' grasping gestures and executing anthropomorphic grasp processes. Although prosthetic hands equipped with vision systems enables the objects' feature recognition, they lack perception of human grasping intention. Therefore, this paper explores the estimation of grasping gestures solely through visual data to accomplish anthropopathic grasping control and the determination of grasping intention within a multi-object environment. To address this, we propose the Spatial Geometry-based Gesture Mapping (SG-GM) method, which constructs gesture functions based on the geometric features of the human hand grasping processes. It's subsequently implemented on the prosthetic hand. Furthermore, we propose the Motion Trajectory Regression-based Grasping Intent Estimation (MTR-GIE) algorithm. This algorithm predicts pre-grasping object utilizing regression prediction and prior spatial segmentation estimation derived from the prosthetic hand's position and trajectory. The experiments were conducted to grasp 8 common daily objects including cup, fork, etc. The experimental results presented a similarity coefficient $R^{2}$ of grasping process of 0.911, a Root Mean Squared Error ($RMSE$) of 2.47\degree, a success rate of grasping of 95.43$\%$, and an average duration of grasping process of 3.07$\pm$0.41 s. Furthermore, grasping experiments in a multi-object environment were conducted. The average accuracy of intent estimation reached 94.35$\%$. Our methodologies offer a groundbreaking approach to enhance the prosthetic hand's functionality and provides valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  | None |

The conventional workflow involves manually adjusting the patient support to align the center of the target body part with the laser projector or other guiding devices. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we propose an automated patient positioning system that utilizes a camera to detect specific hand gestures from technicians, allowing users to indicate the target patient region to the system and initiate automated positioning. Our approach relies on a novel multi-stage pipeline to recognize and interpret the technicians' gestures, translating them into precise motions of medical devices. We evaluate our proposed pipeline during actual MRI scanning procedures, using RGB-Depth cameras to capture the process. Results show that our system achieves accurate and precise patient positioning with minimal technician intervention. Furthermore, we validate our method on HaGRID, a large-scale hand gesture dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in hand detection and gesture recognition.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 | None |

Among these types of models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have arisen as a powerful tool for generating synthetic data that mimic real-world scenarios with high fidelity. However, Human Gesture Recognition (HGR), a subset of HAR, particularly in healthcare applications, using time series data such as allergic gestures, remains highly unexplored. In this paper, we examine and evaluate the performance of two GANs in the generation of synthetic gesture motion data that compose a part of an open-source benchmark dataset. The data is related to the disease identification domain and healthcare, specifically to allergic rhinitis. We also focus on these AI models' performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, and privacy. Furthermore, we examine the scenario if the synthetic data can substitute real data, in training scenarios and how well models trained on synthetic data can be generalized for the allergic rhinitis gestures. In our work, these gestures are related to 6-axes accelerometer and gyroscope data, serving as multi-variate time series instances, and retrieved from smart wearable devices. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the feasibility of synthesizing motion gestures for allergic rhinitis from wearable IoT device data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and testing their impact on the generalization of gesture recognition systems. It is worth noting that, even if our method has been applied to a specific category of gestures, it is designed to be generalized and can be deployed also to other motion data in the HGR domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT), 2024</p></details> | None |

In wireless communication systems, CSI provides essential insights into channel conditions, enabling system optimizations like channel compensation and dynamic resource allocation. However, the high computational complexity of CSI estimation algorithms necessitates the development of fast deep learning methods for CSI prediction. In wireless sensing systems, CSI can be leveraged to infer environmental changes, facilitating various functions, including gesture recognition and people identification. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant advantages over model-based approaches in these fine-grained CSI classification tasks, particularly when classes vary across different scenarios. However, a major challenge in training deep learning networks for wireless systems is the limited availability of data, further complicated by the diverse formats of many public datasets, which hinder integration. Additionally, collecting CSI data can be resource-intensive, requiring considerable time and manpower. To address these challenges, we propose CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, effectively utilizing limited data through a pre-training and fine-tuning approach. Building on CSI-BERT1, we enhance the model architecture by introducing an Adaptive Re-Weighting Layer (ARL) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to better capture sub-carrier and timestamp information, effectively addressing the permutation-invariance problem. Furthermore, we propose a Mask Prediction Model (MPM) fine-tuning method to improve the model's adaptability for CSI prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, accurately recognizing predefined gestures within a closed set is still inadequate in practice; a robust open-set system needs to effectively reject unknown gestures while correctly classifying known ones, which is rarely explored in the field of myoelectric gesture recognition. To handle this challenge, we first report a significant distinction in prediction inconsistency discovered for unknown classes, which arises from different perspectives and can substantially enhance open-set recognition performance. Based on this insight, we propose a novel dual-perspective inconsistency learning approach, PredIN, to explicitly magnify the prediction inconsistency by enhancing the inconsistency of class feature distribution within different perspectives. Specifically, PredIN maximizes the class feature distribution inconsistency among the dual perspectives to enhance their differences. Meanwhile, it optimizes inter-class separability within an individual perspective to maintain individual performance. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the PredIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin. Our proposed method simultaneously achieves accurate closed-set classification for predefined gestures and effective rejection for unknown gestures, exhibiting its efficacy and superiority in open-set gesture recognition based on sEMG.</p></details> | Under review | None |

First, we discuss various forms of subsea telerobotics applications, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) interface systems, and the challenges they face in robust underwater sensing, real-time estimation, and low-latency communication. Through this analysis, we highlight how advanced HMIs facilitate intuitive interactions between human operators and robots to overcome these challenges. A detailed review then categorizes and evaluates the cutting-edge HMI systems based on their offered features from both human perspectives (e.g., enhancing operator control and situational awareness) and machine perspectives (e.g., improving safety, mission accuracy, and task efficiency). Moreover, we examine the literature on bidirectional interaction and intelligent collaboration in terms of sensory feedback and intuitive control mechanisms for both physical and virtual interfaces. The paper concludes by identifying critical challenges, open research questions, and future directions, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary collaboration in subsea telerobotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages including 22 pages of main text</p></details> | None |
| **[ConvMixFormer- A Resource-efficient Convolution Mixer for Transformer-based Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07118v3)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have demonstrated remarkable success in many domains such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. With the growing interest in transformer-based architectures, they are now utilized for gesture recognition. So, we also explore and devise a novel ConvMixFormer architecture for dynamic hand gestures. The transformers use quadratic scaling of the attention features with the sequential data, due to which these models are computationally complex and heavy. We have considered this drawback of the transformer and designed a resource-efficient model that replaces the self-attention in the transformer with the simple convolutional layer-based token mixer. The computational cost and the parameters used for the convolution-based mixer are comparatively less than the quadratic self-attention. Convolution-mixer helps the model capture the local spatial features that self-attention struggles to capture due to their sequential processing nature. Further, an efficient gate mechanism is employed instead of a conventional feed-forward network in the transformer to help the model control the flow of features within different stages of the proposed model. This design uses fewer learnable parameters which is nearly half the vanilla transformer that helps in fast and efficient training. The proposed method is evaluated on NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture and Briareo datasets and our model has achieved state-of-the-art results on single and multimodal inputs. We have also shown the parameter efficiency of the proposed ConvMixFormer model compared to other methods.

We cover 15 new gestures with conversation and control functions, including two-handed ones. Building on the foundational concepts proposed by HaGRID's authors, we implemented the dynamic gesture recognition algorithm and further enhanced it by adding three new groups of manipulation gestures. The ``no gesture" class was diversified by adding samples of natural hand movements, which allowed us to minimize false positives by 6 times. Combining extra samples with HaGRID, the received version outperforms the original in pre-training models for gesture-related tasks. Besides, we achieved the best generalization ability among gesture and hand detection datasets. In addition, the second version enhances the quality of the gestures generated by the diffusion model. HaGRIDv2, pre-trained models, and a dynamic gesture recognition algorithm are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>hand ...</summary><p>hand gesture recognition, dataset, hgr system, large-scale database</p></details> | None |
| **[Micro Hand Gesture Recognition System Using Ultrasonic Active Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00216v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a micro hand gesture recognition system and methods using ultrasonic active sensing. This system uses micro dynamic hand gestures for recognition to achieve human-computer interaction (HCI). The implemented system, called hand-ultrasonic gesture (HUG), consists of ultrasonic active sensing, pulsed radar signal processing, and time-sequence pattern recognition by machine learning. We adopt lower frequency (300 kHz) ultrasonic active sensing to obtain high resolution range-Doppler image features. Using high quality sequential range-Doppler features, we propose a state-transition-based hidden Markov model for gesture recognition. This method achieves a recognition accuracy of nearly 90\% by using symbolized range-Doppler features and significantly reduces the computational complexity and power consumption. Furthermore, to achieve higher classification accuracy, we utilize an end-to-end neural network model and obtain a recognition accuracy of 96.32\%. In addition to offline analysis, a real-time prototype is released to verify our method's potential for application in the real world.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lack of efficient and high-accuracy deep SNN learning algorithms prevents them from practical edge deployments at a strictly bounded cost. In this paper, we propose the spatiotemporal orthogonal propagation (STOP) algorithm to tackle this challenge. Our algorithm enables fully synergistic learning of synaptic weights as well as firing thresholds and leakage factors in spiking neurons to improve SNN accuracy, in a unified temporally-forward trace-based framework to mitigate the huge memory requirement for storing neural states across all time-steps in the forward pass. Characteristically, the spatially-backward neuronal errors and temporally-forward traces propagate orthogonally to and independently of each other, substantially reducing computational complexity. Our STOP algorithm obtained high recognition accuracies of 94.84%, 74.92%, 98.26% and 77.10% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets with adequate deep convolutional SNNs of VGG-11 or ResNet-18 structures. Compared with other deep SNN training algorithms, our method is more plausible for edge intelligent scenarios where resources are limited but high-accuracy in-situ learning is desired.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (exclude supplementary), 5 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Robust Dynamic Gesture Recognition at Ultra-Long Distances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18413v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic hand gestures play a crucial role in conveying nonverbal information for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), eliminating the need for complex interfaces. Current models for dynamic gesture recognition suffer from limitations in effective recognition range, restricting their application to close proximity scenarios. In this letter, we present a novel approach to recognizing dynamic gestures in an ultra-range distance of up to 28 meters, enabling natural, directive communication for guiding robots in both indoor and outdoor environments. Our proposed SlowFast-Transformer (SFT) model effectively integrates the SlowFast architecture with Transformer layers to efficiently process and classify gesture sequences captured at ultra-range distances, overcoming challenges of low resolution and environmental noise. We further introduce a distance-weighted loss function shown to enhance learning and improve model robustness at varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.1% on a diverse dataset with challenging ultra-range gestures. This enables robots to react appropriately to human commands from a far distance, providing an essential enhancement in HRI, especially in scenarios requiring seamless and natural interaction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FORS-EMG: A Novel sEMG Dataset for Hand Gesture Recognition Across Multiple Forearm Orientations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07484v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals hold significant potential for gesture recognition and robust prosthetic hand development. However, sEMG signals are affected by various physiological and dynamic factors, including forearm orientation, electrode displacement, and limb position. Most existing sEMG datasets lack these dynamic considerations. This study introduces a novel multichannel sEMG dataset to evaluate commonly used hand gestures across three distinct forearm orientations. The dataset was collected from nineteen able-bodied subjects performing twelve hand gestures in three forearm orientations--supination, rest, and pronation. Eight MFI EMG electrodes were strategically placed at the elbow and mid-forearm to record high-quality EMG signals. Signal quality was validated through Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Motion artifact ratio (SMR) metrics. Hand gesture classification performance across forearm orientations was evaluated using machine learning classifiers, including LDA, SVM, and KNN, alongside five feature extraction methods: TDD, TSD, FTDD, AR-RMS, and SNTDF. Furthermore, deep learning models such as 1D CNN, RNN, LSTM, and hybrid architectures were employed for a comprehensive analysis. Notably, the LDA classifier achieved the highest F1 score of 88.58\% with the SNTDF feature set when trained on hand gesture data of resting and tested across gesture data of all orientations. The promising results from extensive analyses underscore the proposed dataset's potential as a benchmark for advancing gesture recognition technologies, clinical sEMG research, and human-computer interaction applications. The dataset is publicly available in MATLAB format. Dataset: \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ummerummanchaity/fors-emg-a-novel-semg-dataset}</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |

It has wide applications in prosthesis control, rehabilitation training, and human-computer interaction. Using electrodes placed on the skin, the EMG sensor captures muscle signals, which are processed and filtered to reduce noise. Numerous feature extraction and machine learning algorithms have been proposed to extract and classify muscle signals to distinguish between various hand gestures. This paper aims to benchmark the performance of EMG-based hand gesture recognition using novel feature extraction methods, namely, fused time-domain descriptors, temporal-spatial descriptors, and wavelet transform-based features, combined with the state-of-the-art machine and deep learning models. Experimental investigations on the Grabmyo dataset demonstrate that the 1D Dilated CNN performed the best with an accuracy of $97\%$ using fused time-domain descriptors such as power spectral moments, sparsity, irregularity factor and waveform length ratio. Similarly, on the FORS-EMG dataset, random forest performed the best with an accuracy of $94.95\%$ using temporal-spatial descriptors (which include time domain features along with additional features such as coefficient of variation (COV), and Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO)).</p></details> | IEEE BIBM 2024 | None |
| **[A Diffusion-based Data Generator for Training Object Recognition Models in Ultra-Range Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09846v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object recognition, commonly performed by a camera, is a fundamental requirement for robots to complete complex tasks. Some tasks require recognizing objects far from the robot's camera. A challenging example is Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition (URGR) in human-robot interaction where the user exhibits directive gestures at a distance of up to 25~m from the robot. However, training a model to recognize hardly visible objects located in ultra-range requires an exhaustive collection of a significant amount of labeled samples. The generation of synthetic training datasets is a recent solution to the lack of real-world data, while unable to properly replicate the realistic visual characteristics of distant objects in images. In this letter, we propose the Diffusion in Ultra-Range (DUR) framework based on a Diffusion model to generate labeled images of distant objects in various scenes. The DUR generator receives a desired distance and class (e.g., gesture) and outputs a corresponding synthetic image. We apply DUR to train a URGR model with directive gestures in which fine details of the gesturing hand are challenging to distinguish. DUR is compared to other types of generative models showcasing superiority both in fidelity and in recognition success rate when training a URGR model. More importantly, training a DUR model on a limited amount of real data and then using it to generate synthetic data for training a URGR model outperforms directly training the URGR model on real data. The synthetic-based URGR model is also demonstrated in gesture-based direction of a ground robot.</p></details> |  | None |

By utilizing optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system achieves high-precision gesture recognition, significantly improving user interactions with digital interfaces. The process begins with preprocessing collected gesture images to meet CNN input requirements, followed by sophisticated feature extraction and classification techniques. To address class imbalance, we employ Focal Loss as the loss function, ensuring robust model performance across diverse gesture types. Experimental results demonstrate notable improvements in model metrics, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Recall metrics improving as we transition from simpler models like VGG16 to more advanced ones such as DenseNet. Our enhanced model achieves strong AUC and Recall values, outperforming standard benchmarks. Notably, the system's ability to support real-time and efficient gesture recognition paves the way for a new era in UI design, where intuitive user gestures can be seamlessly integrated into everyday technology use, reducing the learning curve and enhancing user satisfaction. The implications of this development extend beyond technical performance to fundamentally reshape user-technology interactions, underscoring the critical role of gesture-based interfaces in the next generation of UI development. Such advancements promise to significantly enhance smart life experiences, positioning gesture recognition as a key driver in the evolution of user-centric interfaces.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16711v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their bio-inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons inherently capture temporal information. This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods, such as encrypting messages, eye contact, and micro-gestures, had problems with either inaccurate information transmission or leakage of interaction intentions. To this end, a novel gesture-free hand intention recognition scheme was proposed, that adopted surface electromyography(sEMG) and isometric contraction theory to recognize different hand intentions without any gesture. Specifically, this work includes four parts: (1) the experimental system, consisting of the upper computer software, self-conducted myoelectric watch, and sports platform, is built to get sEMG signals and simulate multiple usage scenarios; (2) the paradigm is designed to standard prompt and collect the gesture-free sEMG datasets. Eight-channel signals of ten subjects were recorded twice per subject at about 5-10 days intervals; (3) the toolbox integrates preprocessing methods (data segmentation, filter, normalization, etc.), commonly used sEMG signal decoding methods, and various plotting functions, to facilitate the research of the dataset; (4) the benchmark results of widely used methods are provided. The results involve single-day, cross-day, and cross-subject experiments of 6-class and 12-class gesture-free hand intention when subjects with different sports motions.

| **[Word-level Sign Language Recognition with Multi-stream Neural Networks Focusing on Local Regions and Skeletal Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15989v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Word-level sign language recognition (WSLR) has attracted attention because it is expected to overcome the communication barrier between people with speech impairment and those who can hear. In the WSLR problem, a method designed for action recognition has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy. Indeed, it sounds reasonable for an action recognition method to perform well on WSLR because sign language is regarded as an action. However, a careful evaluation of the tasks reveals that the tasks of action recognition and WSLR are inherently different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel WSLR method that takes into account information specifically useful for the WSLR problem. We realize it as a multi-stream neural network (MSNN), which consist of three streams: 1) base stream, 2) local image stream, and 3) skeleton stream. Each stream is designed to handle different types of information. The base stream deals with quick and detailed movements of the hands and body, the local image stream focuses on handshapes and facial expressions, and the skeleton stream captures the relative positions of the body and both hands. This approach allows us to combine various types of data for more comprehensive gesture analysis. Experimental results on the WLASL and MS-ASL datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method; it achieved an improvement of approximately 10\%--15\% in Top-1 accuracy when compared with conventional methods.</p></details> |  | None |
