| **[Astrea: A MOE-based Visual Understanding Model with Progressive Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09445v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a pivotal paradigm in multimodal understanding, offering a powerful framework for integrating visual and linguistic information. However, the increasing complexity and diversity of tasks present significant challenges in coordinating load balancing across heterogeneous visual experts, where optimizing one specialist's performance often compromises others' capabilities. To address task heterogeneity and expert load imbalance, we propose Astrea, a novel multi-expert collaborative VLM architecture based on progressive pre-alignment. Astrea introduces three key innovations: 1) A heterogeneous expert coordination mechanism that integrates four specialized models (detection, segmentation, classification, captioning) into a comprehensive expert matrix covering essential visual comprehension elements; 2) A dynamic knowledge fusion strategy featuring progressive pre-alignment to harmonize experts within the VLM latent space through contrastive learning, complemented by probabilistically activated stochastic residual connections to preserve knowledge continuity; 3) An enhanced optimization framework utilizing momentum contrastive learning for long-range dependency modeling and adaptive weight allocators for real-time expert contribution calibration. Extensive evaluations across 12 benchmark tasks spanning VQA, image captioning, and cross-modal retrieval demonstrate Astrea's superiority over state-of-the-art models, achieving an average performance gain of +4.7\%. This study provides the first empirical demonstration that progressive pre-alignment strategies enable VLMs to overcome task heterogeneity limitations, establishing new methodological foundations for developing general-purpose multimodal agents.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VL-ICL Bench: The Devil in the Details of Multimodal In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13164v4)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) famously exhibit emergent in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks using few-shot examples provided as a prompt, without updating the model's weights. Built on top of LLMs, vision large language models (VLLMs) have advanced significantly in areas such as recognition, reasoning, and grounding. However, investigations into \emph{multimodal ICL} have predominantly focused on few-shot visual question answering (VQA), and image captioning, which we will show neither exploit the strengths of ICL, nor test its limitations. The broader capabilities and limitations of multimodal ICL remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark VL-ICL Bench for multimodal in-context learning, encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks that involve both images and text as inputs and outputs, and different types of challenges, from {perception to reasoning and long context length}. We evaluate the abilities of state-of-the-art VLLMs against this benchmark suite, revealing their diverse strengths and weaknesses, and showing that even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4, find the tasks challenging. By highlighting a range of new ICL tasks, and the associated strengths and limitations of existing models, we hope that our dataset will inspire future work on enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of VLLMs, as well as inspire new applications that leverage VLLM ICL. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ys-zong/VL-ICL.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/ys-zong/VL-ICL) |
| **[SVLA: A Unified Speech-Vision-Language Assistant with Multimodal Reasoning and Speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24164v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision and language models show strong performance in tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and retrieval. However, challenges remain in integrating speech, text, and vision into a unified model, especially for spoken tasks. Speech generation methods vary (some produce speech directly), others through text (but their impact on quality is unclear). Evaluation often relies on automatic speech recognition, which may introduce bias. We propose SVLA, a unified speech vision language model based on a transformer architecture that handles multimodal inputs and outputs. We train it on 38.2 million speech text image examples, including 64.1 hours of synthetic speech. We also introduce Speech VQA Accuracy, a new metric for evaluating spoken responses. SVLA improves multimodal understanding and generation by better combining speech, vision, and language.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |
| **[Enhancing Object Coherence in Layout-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10522v7)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image generation. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine control over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains challenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence (e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the hand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and self-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for this task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains rich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in the images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and latent images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in our experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the image synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we develop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly integrate local contextual physical coherence relation into each pixel's generation process. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the physical coherence restrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding. Through visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of SCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable physical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/CodeGoat24/EOCNet</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/CodeGoat24/EOCNet) |
| **[Context-Independent OCR with Multimodal LLMs: Effects of Image Resolution and Visual Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23667v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their high versatility in tasks such as image captioning, document analysis, and automated content generation, multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention across various industrial fields. In particular, they have been shown to surpass specialized models in Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Nevertheless, their performance under different image conditions remains insufficiently investigated, and individual character recognition is not guaranteed due to their reliance on contextual cues. In this work, we examine a context-independent OCR task using single-character images with diverse visual complexities to determine the conditions for accurate recognition. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs can match conventional OCR methods at about 300 ppi, yet their performance deteriorates significantly below 150 ppi. Additionally, we observe a very weak correlation between visual complexity and misrecognitions, whereas a conventional OCR-specific model exhibits no correlation. These results suggest that image resolution and visual complexity may play an important role in the reliable application of multimodal LLMs to OCR tasks that require precise character-level accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Will Pre-Training Ever End? A First Step Toward Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs via Self-Improving Systematic Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v5)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) has shifted focus from pre-training to inference-time compute scaling and post-training optimization, driven by concerns over limited high-quality real-world data. However, these strategies alone are insufficient for advancing model capabilities. We hypothesize that effective model improvement requires a strong synergy among pre-training, inference-time compute scaling, and post-training optimization. In this paper, we validate this hypothesis in the context of multimodal pre-training for foundation MLLM construction. We introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework for constructing next-generation foundation MLLMs by imparting multimodal knowledge and enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we introduce Chain-of-Description, a step-by-step visual understanding method to improve comprehensive perception, and integrate structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to support in-depth multimodal reasoning. SIcog first equips a base model with systematic perception and reasoning using minimal external supervision. The enhanced model then generates candidate image captions and CoT-style reasoning responses for unlabeled images and image-question pairs across diverse tasks, which are curated through a self-consistency mechanism. These curated samples are subsequently used for large-scale multimodal pre-training, completing a self-learning cycle that strengthens the model's cognitive foundation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with substantially improved multimodal cognition, outperforming prevailing pre-training approaches. These findings empirically establish SIcog as a promising framework for realizing a complete self-improving paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages.

| **[Semantic-Spatial Feature Fusion with Dynamic Graph Refinement for Remote Sensing Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23453v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image captioning aims to generate semantically accurate descriptions that are closely linked to the visual features of remote sensing images. Existing approaches typically emphasize fine-grained extraction of visual features and capturing global information. However, they often overlook the complementary role of textual information in enhancing visual semantics and face challenges in precisely locating objects that are most relevant to the image context. To address these challenges, this paper presents a semantic-spatial feature fusion with dynamic graph refinement (SFDR) method, which integrates the semantic-spatial feature fusion (SSFF) and dynamic graph feature refinement (DGFR) modules. The SSFF module utilizes a multi-level feature representation strategy by leveraging pre-trained CLIP features, grid features, and ROI features to integrate rich semantic and spatial information. In the DGFR module, a graph attention network captures the relationships between feature nodes, while a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes objects that are most relevant to the current scene and suppresses less significant ones. Therefore, the proposed SFDR method significantly enhances the quality of the generated descriptions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

| **[Missing Target-Relevant Information Prediction with World Model for Accurate Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17109v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) involves diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intent across domain, scene, object, and attribute. The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image, especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named PrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted relevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pter61/predicir.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Pter61/predicir) |
| **[Barking Up The Syntactic Tree: Enhancing VLM Training with Syntactic Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08110v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) implicitly learn to associate image regions with words from large-scale training data, demonstrating an emergent capability for grounding concepts without dense annotations[14,18,51]. However, the coarse-grained supervision from image-caption pairs is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities in object-concept correspondence, even with enormous data volume. Rich semantic and syntactic structures within the text modality have been overlooked as sources of supervision. Starting from contrastive architectures (BLIP and ALBEF) that show strong intrinsic grounding abilities, we propose HIerarchically STructured Learning (HIST). HIST enhances spatial vision-language alignment without using additional human annotations, by hierarchically decomposing captions into the constituent Subjects, Phrases, and Composite Phrases, and enforcing entailment relation between a parent and its children in the hierarchy. Specifically, we introduce two novel loss functions: (1) Subject Loss, which aligns image content with the subject of the corresponding phrase, acting as an entailment of standard contrastive/matching losses at the Phrase level; (2) Composition Loss, to balance attention across multiple objects. HIST is general, and can be applied to any VLM for which attention between vision and language can be computed. Compared to baseline VLMs, HIST achieves up to +9.8% improvement in visual grounding and +6.3% in multi-object referring segmentation. Surprisingly, the improved spatial grounding leads to improvements in other downstream VLM tasks: +1.1% in image-text retrieval, and +0.2% in visual question answering.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An End-to-End Model for Photo-Sharing Multi-modal Dialogue Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08650v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-Sharing Multi-modal dialogue generation requires a dialogue agent not only to generate text responses but also to share photos at the proper moment. Using image text caption as the bridge, a pipeline model integrates an image caption model, a text generation model, and an image generation model to handle this complex multi-modal task. However, representing the images with text captions may loss important visual details and information and cause error propagation in the complex dialogue system. Besides, the pipeline model isolates the three models separately because discrete image text captions hinder end-to-end gradient propagation. We propose the first end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation, which integrates an image perceptron and an image generator with a large language model. The large language model employs the Q-Former to perceive visual images in the input end. For image generation in the output end, we propose a dynamic vocabulary transformation matrix and use straight-through and gumbel-softmax techniques to align the large language model and stable diffusion model and achieve end-to-end gradient propagation. We perform experiments on PhotoChat and DialogCC datasets to evaluate our end-to-end model. Compared with pipeline models, the end-to-end model gains state-of-the-art performances on various metrics of text and image generation. More analysis experiments also verify the effectiveness of the end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 | None |
| **[Identifying Multi-modal Knowledge Neurons in Pretrained Transformers via Two-stage Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22941v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. Although these models allow for integrated visual and language understanding, they present challenges such as opaque internal processing and the generation of hallucinations and misinformation. Therefore, there is a need for a method to clarify the location of knowledge in MLLMs. In this study, we propose a method to identify neurons associated with specific knowledge using MiniGPT-4, a Transformer-based MLLM. Specifically, we extract knowledge neurons through two stages: activation differences filtering using inpainting and gradient-based filtering using GradCAM. Experiments on the image caption generation task using the MS COCO 2017 dataset, BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore quantitative evaluation, and qualitative evaluation using an activation heatmap showed that our method is able to locate knowledge with higher accuracy than existing methods. This study contributes to the visualization and explainability of knowledge in MLLMs and shows the potential for future knowledge editing and control.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Personalization for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13360v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.

| **[JEEM: Vision-Language Understanding in Four Arabic Dialects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21910v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce JEEM, a benchmark designed to evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on visual understanding across four Arabic-speaking countries: Jordan, The Emirates, Egypt, and Morocco. JEEM includes the tasks of image captioning and visual question answering, and features culturally rich and regionally diverse content. This dataset aims to assess the ability of VLMs to generalize across dialects and accurately interpret cultural elements in visual contexts. In an evaluation of five prominent open-source Arabic VLMs and GPT-4V, we find that the Arabic VLMs consistently underperform, struggling with both visual understanding and dialect-specific generation. While GPT-4V ranks best in this comparison, the model's linguistic competence varies across dialects, and its visual understanding capabilities lag behind. This underscores the need for more inclusive models and the value of culturally-diverse evaluation paradigms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BACON: Improving Clarity of Image Captions via Bag-of-Concept Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03314v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in large Vision-Language Models have brought precise, accurate image captioning, vital for advancing multi-modal image understanding and processing. Yet these captions often carry lengthy, intertwined contexts that are difficult to parse and frequently overlook essential cues, posing a great barrier for models like GroundingDINO and SDXL, which lack the strong text encoding and syntax analysis needed to fully leverage dense captions. To address this, we propose BACON, a prompting method that breaks down VLM-generated captions into disentangled, structured elements such as objects, relationships, styles, and themes. This approach not only minimizes confusion from handling complex contexts but also allows for efficient transfer into a JSON dictionary, enabling models without linguistic processing capabilities to easily access key information. We annotated 100,000 image-caption pairs using BACON with GPT-4V and trained an LLaVA captioner on this dataset, enabling it to produce BACON-style captions without relying on costly GPT-4V. Evaluations of overall quality, precision, and recall-as well as user studies-demonstrate that the resulting caption model consistently outperforms other SOTA VLM models in generating high-quality captions. Besides, we show that BACON-style captions exhibit better clarity when applied to various models, enabling them to accomplish previously unattainable tasks or surpass existing SOTA solutions without training. For example, BACON-style captions help GroundingDINO achieve 1.51x higher recall scores on open-vocabulary object detection tasks compared to leading methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mitigating Low-Level Visual Hallucinations Requires Self-Awareness: Database, Model and Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20673v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework. However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems. While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20853v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal generative models that can understand and generate across multiple modalities are dominated by autoregressive (AR) approaches, which process tokens sequentially from left to right, or top to bottom. These models jointly handle images, text, video, and audio for various tasks such as image captioning, question answering, and image generation. In this work, we explore discrete diffusion models as a unified generative formulation in the joint text and image domain, building upon their recent success in text generation. Discrete diffusion models offer several advantages over AR models, including improved control over quality versus diversity of generated samples, the ability to perform joint multimodal inpainting (across both text and image domains), and greater controllability in generation through guidance. Leveraging these benefits, we present the first Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion (UniDisc) model which is capable of jointly understanding and generating text and images for a variety of downstream tasks. We compare UniDisc to multimodal AR models, performing a scaling analysis and demonstrating that UniDisc outperforms them in terms of both performance and inference-time compute, enhanced controllability, editability, inpainting, and flexible trade-off between inference time and generation quality.

However, few studies have developed benchmarks specifically tailored for detailed captions to measure their accuracy and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we introduce a detailed caption benchmark, termed as CompreCap, to evaluate the visual context from a directed scene graph view. Concretely, we first manually segment the image into semantically meaningful regions (i.e., semantic segmentation mask) according to common-object vocabulary, while also distinguishing attributes of objects within all those regions. Then directional relation labels of these objects are annotated to compose a directed scene graph that can well encode rich compositional information of the image. Based on our directed scene graph, we develop a pipeline to assess the generated detailed captions from LVLMs on multiple levels, including the object-level coverage, the accuracy of attribute descriptions, the score of key relationships, etc. Experimental results on the CompreCap dataset confirm that our evaluation method aligns closely with human evaluation scores across LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

This novel task aims to generate temporally fine-grained captions that not only accurately describe each frame but also capture the subtle progression of actions throughout a video sequence. Despite the strong capabilities of existing leading vision language models, they often struggle to discern the nuances of frame-wise differences. To address this, we propose ProgressCaptioner, a captioning model designed to capture the fine-grained temporal dynamics within an action sequence. Alongside, we develop the FrameCap dataset to support training and the FrameCapEval benchmark to assess caption quality. The results demonstrate that ProgressCaptioner significantly surpasses leading captioning models, producing precise captions that accurately capture action progression and set a new standard for temporal precision in video captioning. Finally, we showcase practical applications of our approach, specifically in aiding keyframe selection and advancing video understanding, highlighting its broad utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025, Project website: https://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/ProgressCaptioner/</p></details> | None |
| **[PAINT: Paying Attention to INformed Tokens to Mitigate Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12206v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and describing visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various vision-language tasks. However, these models often generate descriptions containing objects or details that are absent in the input image, a phenomenon commonly known as hallucination. Our work investigates the key reasons behind this issue by analyzing the pattern of self-attention in transformer layers. We find that hallucinations often arise from the progressive weakening of attention weight to visual tokens in the deeper layers of the LLM. Some previous works naively boost the attention of all visual tokens to mitigate this issue, resulting in suboptimal hallucination reduction. To address this, we identify two critical sets of visual tokens that facilitate the transfer of visual information from the vision encoder to the LLM. Local tokens encode grounded information about objects present in an image, while summary tokens capture the overall aggregated representation of the image. Importantly, these two sets of tokens require different levels of weight enhancement. To this end, we propose \textbf{PAINT} (\textbf{P}aying \textbf{A}ttention to \textbf{IN}formed \textbf{T}okens), a plug-and-play framework that intervenes in the self-attention mechanism of the LLM, selectively boosting the attention weights of local and summary tokens with experimentally learned margins. Evaluation on the MSCOCO image captioning dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces hallucination rates by up to 62.3\% compared to baseline models while maintaining accuracy.

Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Mind the Gap: Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19707v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools, excelling in tasks that integrate visual and textual comprehension, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and image-text retrieval. However, existing benchmarks for VLMs include spatial components, which often fail to isolate spatial reasoning from related tasks such as object detection or semantic comprehension. In this paper, we address these deficiencies with a multi-faceted approach towards understanding spatial reasoning. Informed by the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of human spatial reasoning abilities, we present a detailed analysis that first delineates the core elements of spatial reasoning: spatial relations, orientation and navigation, mental rotation, and spatial visualization, and then assesses the performance of these models in both synthetic and real-world images, bridging controlled and naturalistic contexts. We analyze 13 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models, uncovering pivotal insights into their spatial reasoning performance. Our results reveal profound shortcomings in current VLMs, with average accuracy across the 13 models approximating random chance, highlighting spatial reasoning as a persistent obstacle.

However, inconsistencies between the visual information and the generated text, a phenomenon referred to as hallucinations, remain an unsolved problem with regard to the trustworthiness of LVLMs. To address this problem, recent works proposed to incorporate computationally costly Large (Vision) Language Models in order to detect hallucinations on a sentence- or subsentence-level. In this work, we introduce MetaToken, a lightweight binary classifier to detect hallucinations on the token-level at negligible cost. Based on a statistical analysis, we reveal key factors of hallucinations in LVLMs. MetaToken can be applied to any open-source LVLM without any knowledge about ground truth data providing a calibrated detection of hallucinations. We evaluate our method on four state-of-the-art LVLMs demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest definition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of information through natural language. That information could be stored in a large database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG researchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning (image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG is closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT) and Dialog Systems. Some NLG researchers exclude MT from their definition of the field, since there is no content selection involved where the system has to determine what to say. Conversely, dialog systems do not typically fall under the header of Natural Language Generation since NLG is just one component of dialog systems (the others being Natural Language Understanding and Dialog Management). However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), different subfields of Natural Language Processing have converged on similar methodologies for the production of natural language and the evaluation of automatically generated text.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages + references.

| **[Improved Alignment of Modalities in Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19508v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models have achieved remarkable results in making language models understand vision inputs. However, a unified approach to align these models across diverse tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering remains a challenge. Existing methods either require very big language models or very big datasets which is not efficient in utilizing existing models. This paper addresses this gap and devises a training strategy of auto-regressive vision-language models, to unify vision-language tasks like image-captioning and visual question answering. We propose four training stages for aligning the vision model with the language model, in other words, the language model is given an ability to process visual inputs. We also devise different attention masks for training transformer-based language models that improve the quality of visual features. Further, we introduce some findings, 1) the attention mask should not be applied on visual inputs, 2) the Language model converges faster on AI- generated data, 3) More work should be done in the alignment stage during the pre-training of the model, 4) the model can easily adapt to any downstream tasks like visual question answering on healthcare datasets like PathVQA. After training the model for one epoch for all the stages, it outperforms large models like VILA-13 billion models on common benchmarks like CIDEr scores on COCO and Flickr30k datasets and achieves very close scores to GIT-2 on the same dataset despite being a much smaller model trained on a much smaller dataset. All of the training is done using best practices available like multi- GPU parallel training, lower-precision training with 16-bit float numbers, faster attention (SDPA), and gradient accumulation, and completed the training within 12 hours.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or image-caption data, disregarding pathology reports with more clinically authentic information from pathologists and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Even recent slide-level FMs still struggle to provide whole-slide context for patch representation. In this study, for the first time, we develop a pathology foundation model incorporating three levels of modalities: pathology slides, pathology reports, and gene expression data, which resulted in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types, amounting to over 116 million pathological patch images. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm that injects the multimodal whole-slide context into the patch representation, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the pretraining workflow for CPath, enabling the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate three modalities at the whole-slide context for enhancing pathology FMs. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, we built the largest spectrum of oncological benchmark, spanning 7 categories of oncological applications in 15 types of 97 practical oncological tasks.</p></details> | 62 pages | None |

Inspired by concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and based on visual-question answering (VQA) chains, ImageSet2Text iteratively extracts key concepts from image subsets, encodes them into a structured graph, and refines insights using an external knowledge graph and CLIP-based validation. This iterative process enhances interpretability and enables accurate and detailed set-level summarization. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate ImageSet2Text's descriptions on accuracy, completeness, readability and overall quality, benchmarking it against existing vision-language models and introducing new datasets for large-scale group image captioning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19296v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) allows users to search target images with a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text that describes the user's modification demand over the reference image. Nevertheless, due to the expensive labor cost of training data annotation, recent researchers have shifted to the challenging task of zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR), which targets fulfilling CIR without annotated triplets. The pioneer ZS-CIR studies focus on converting the CIR task into a standard text-to-image retrieval task by pre-training a textual inversion network that can map a given image into a single pseudo-word token. Despite their significant progress, their coarse-grained textual inversion may be insufficient to capture the full content of the image accurately. To overcome this issue, in this work, we propose a novel Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for ZS-CIR, named FTI4CIR. In particular, FTI4CIR comprises two main components: fine-grained pseudo-word token mapping and tri-wise caption-based semantic regularization. The former maps the image into a subject-oriented pseudo-word token and several attribute-oriented pseudo-word tokens to comprehensively express the image in the textual form, while the latter works on jointly aligning the fine-grained pseudo-word tokens to the real-word token embedding space based on a BLIP-generated image caption template. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reverse Prompt: Cracking the Recipe Inside Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19937v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has become increasingly popular, but achieving the desired images often requires extensive prompt engineering. In this paper, we explore how to decode textual prompts from reference images, a process we refer to as image reverse prompt engineering. This technique enables us to gain insights from reference images, understand the creative processes of great artists, and generate impressive new images. To address this challenge, we propose a method known as automatic reverse prompt optimization (ARPO). Specifically, our method refines an initial prompt into a high-quality prompt through an iteratively imitative gradient prompt optimization process: 1) generating a recreated image from the current prompt to instantiate its guidance capability; 2) producing textual gradients, which are candidate prompts intended to reduce the difference between the recreated image and the reference image; 3) updating the current prompt with textual gradients using a greedy search method to maximize the CLIP similarity between prompt and reference image. We compare ARPO with several baseline methods, including handcrafted techniques, gradient-based prompt tuning methods, image captioning, and data-driven selection method. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our ARPO converges quickly to generate high-quality reverse prompts. More importantly, we can easily create novel images with diverse styles and content by directly editing these reverse prompts. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent approaches offer some grounding capabilities, they cannot track object identities across multiple references or ground both actions and objects simultaneously. We propose a novel ID-based grounding system that enables consistent object reference tracking and action-object linking, and present GroundCap, a dataset containing 52,016 images from 77 movies, with 344 human-annotated and 52,016 automatically generated captions. Each caption is grounded on detected objects (132 classes) and actions (51 classes) using a tag system that maintains object identity while linking actions to the corresponding objects. Our approach features persistent object IDs for reference tracking, explicit action-object linking, and segmentation of background elements through K-means clustering. We propose gMETEOR, a metric combining caption quality with grounding accuracy, and establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Pixtral-12B. Human evaluation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in producing verifiable descriptions with coherent object references.</p></details> | 37 pages | None |

To address this gap, we introduce ComicsPAP, a large-scale benchmark designed for comic strip understanding. Comprising over 100k samples and organized into 5 subtasks under a Pick-a-Panel framework, ComicsPAP demands models to identify the missing panel in a sequence. Our evaluations, conducted under both multi-image and single-image protocols, reveal that current state-of-the-art LMMs perform near chance on these tasks, underscoring significant limitations in capturing sequential and contextual dependencies. To close the gap, we adapted LMMs for comic strip understanding, obtaining better results on ComicsPAP than 10x bigger models, demonstrating that ComicsPAP offers a robust resource to drive future research in multimodal comic comprehension.</p></details> |  | None |

However, leveraging these models to boost performance on downstream tasks with synthetic data poses several challenges, including aligning with real data distribution, scaling synthetic sample volumes, and ensuring their quality. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{A}uto \textbf{C}herry-\textbf{P}icker (ACP), a novel framework that generates high-quality cross-modality training samples at scale to augment perception and multi-modal training. ACP first uses LLMs to sample descriptions and layouts based on object combinations from real data priors, eliminating the need for ground truth image captions or annotations. Next, we use an off-the-shelf controllable diffusion model to generate multiple images. Then, the generated data are refined using a comprehensively designed metric, Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS), to ensure quality. Our customized synthetic high-quality samples boost performance in various scenarios, especially in addressing challenges associated with long-tailed distribution and imbalanced datasets. Experiment results on downstream tasks demonstrate that ACP can significantly improve the performance of existing models. In addition, we find a positive correlation between CLIS and performance gains in downstream tasks. This finding shows the potential for evaluation metrics as the role for various visual perception and MLLM tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 | None |
| **[Flowing from Words to Pixels: A Noise-Free Framework for Cross-Modality Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15213v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, and their generalization, flow matching, have had a remarkable impact on the field of media generation. Here, the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion models, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly, for text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth estimation, and image super-resolution. We hope this paper contributes to accelerating progress in cross-modal media generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 camera-ready version.

| **[Fixing Imbalanced Attention to Mitigate In-Context Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12206v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and describing visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various vision-language tasks. However, these models often generate descriptions containing objects or details that are absent in the input image, a phenomenon commonly known as hallucination. Our work investigates the key reasons behind this issue by analyzing the pattern of self-attention in transformer layers. We find that hallucinations often arise from the progressive weakening of attention weight to visual tokens in the deeper layers of the LLM. Some previous works naively boost the attention of all visual tokens to mitigate this issue, resulting in suboptimal hallucination reduction. To address this, we identify two critical sets of visual tokens that facilitate the transfer of visual information from the vision encoder to the LLM. Local tokens encode grounded information about objects present in an image, while summary tokens capture the overall aggregated representation of the image. Importantly, these two sets of tokens require different levels of weight enhancement. To this end, we propose \textbf{PAINT} (\textbf{P}aying \textbf{A}ttention to \textbf{IN}formed \textbf{T}okens), a plug-and-play framework that intervenes in the self-attention mechanism of the LLM, selectively boosting the attention weights of local and summary tokens with experimentally learned margins. Evaluation on the MSCOCO image captioning dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces hallucination rates by up to 62.3\% compared to baseline models while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 tables, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

However, recent findings suggest high semantic similarity between well-trained unimodal encoders, which raises a key question: Is there a plausible way to connect unimodal backbones for vision-language tasks? To this end, we propose a novel framework that aligns vision and language using frozen unimodal encoders. It involves selecting semantically similar encoders in the latent space, curating a concept-rich dataset of image-caption pairs, and training simple MLP projectors. We evaluated our approach on 12 zero-shot classification datasets and 2 image-text retrieval datasets. Our best model, utilizing DINOv2 and All-Roberta-Large text encoder, achieves 76\(\%\) accuracy on ImageNet with a 20-fold reduction in data and 65-fold reduction in compute requirements compared multi-modal alignment where models are trained from scratch. The proposed framework enhances the accessibility of multimodal model development while enabling flexible adaptation across diverse scenarios.

We outline a stable training approach from inception, an alignment recipe, and an architectural parameterization tailored for the early-fusion, token-based, mixed-modal setting. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive range of tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, text generation, image generation, and long-form mixed modal generation. Chameleon demonstrates broad and general capabilities, including state-of-the-art performance in image captioning tasks, outperforms Llama-2 in text-only tasks while being competitive with models such as Mixtral 8x7B and Gemini-Pro, and performs non-trivial image generation, all in a single model. It also matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including Gemini Pro and GPT-4V, according to human judgments on a new long-form mixed-modal generation evaluation, where either the prompt or outputs contain mixed sequences of both images and text. Chameleon marks a significant step forward in a unified modeling of full multimodal documents.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Self-Improving Systematic Cognition for Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges with fine-grained perception and complex reasoning. Prevalent multimodal pre-training approaches in MLLM construction focus on enhancing perception by training on high-quality image captions. While leveraging advanced MLLMs for caption generation enhances scalability, their outputs often lack comprehensiveness and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework designed to construct next-generation foundation MLLMs by enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description (CoD), an approach that improves an MLLM's systematic perception by enabling step-by-step visual understanding. CoD sequentially focuses on salient content, fine-grained details, relational attributes, and peripheral context, before generating a coherent description, ensuring greater accuracy and comprehensiveness. Additionally, we adopt a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning technique to enable MLLMs to integrate in-depth multimodal reasoning. To construct a next-generation foundation MLLM with self-improved cognition, SIcog first equips an MLLM with systematic perception and reasoning abilities using minimal external annotations. The enhanced models then generate detailed captions and CoT reasoning data, which are further curated through self-consistency. This curated data is ultimately used for multimodal pre-training to develop next-generation foundation models. Extensive experiments on both low- and high-resolution MLLMs across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that, SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with significantly improved cognition, achieving benchmark-leading performance compared to prevalent pre-training approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages.

Yet, without vast amounts of spatial supervision, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle at this task. In this paper, we introduce TWIST & SCOUT, a framework that equips pre-trained MLLMs with visual grounding ability without forgetting their existing image and language understanding skills. To this end, we propose TWIST, a twin-expert stepwise tuning module that modifies the decoder of the language model using one frozen module pre-trained on image understanding tasks and another learnable one for visual grounding tasks. This allows the MLLM to retain previously learned knowledge and skills, while acquiring what is missing. To fine-tune the model effectively, we generate a high-quality synthetic dataset we call SCOUT, which mimics human reasoning in visual grounding. This dataset provides rich supervision signals, describing a step-by-step multimodal reasoning process, thereby simplifying the task of visual grounding. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets, encompassing grounded image captioning, zero-shot localization, and visual grounding tasks. Our method consistently delivers strong performance across all tasks, while retaining the pre-trained image understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated with Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by 6.77% on average and retrieval performance by 4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model.

While recent works have made progress, learning to align medical images and textual findings remains challenging due to the relative scarcity of labeled medical data. For example, datasets for this task are much smaller than those used for image captioning in computer vision. In this work, we propose to transfer representations from CLIP, a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model, to better capture cross-modal semantics between images and texts. However, directly applying CLIP is suboptimal due to the domain gap between natural images and radiology. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce UniCrossAdapter, lightweight adapter modules that are incorporated into CLIP and fine-tuned on the target task while keeping base parameters fixed. The adapters are distributed across modalities and their interaction to enhance vision-language alignment. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, advancing state-of-the-art in radiology report generation. The proposed transfer learning framework provides a means of harnessing semantic knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models to tackle data-scarce medical vision-language tasks.

This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4V) in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks.

Unlike objective tasks such as object/scene recognition, perceptual tasks rely on subjective human assessments, making its data-labeling difficult. The scarcity of such human-annotated data results in small datasets leading to poor generalization. Typically, specialized models were designed for each perceptual task, tailored to its unique characteristics and its own training dataset. We propose a unified architectural framework for solving multiple different perceptual tasks leveraging CLIP as a prior. Our approach is based on recent cognitive findings which indicate that CLIP correlates well with human judgment. While CLIP was explicitly trained to align images and text, it implicitly also learned human inclinations. We attribute this to the inclusion of human-written image captions in CLIP's training data, which contain not only factual image descriptions, but inevitably also human sentiments and emotions. This makes CLIP a particularly strong prior for perceptual tasks. Accordingly, we suggest that minimal adaptation of CLIP suffices for solving a variety of perceptual tasks. Our simple unified framework employs a lightweight adaptation to fine-tune CLIP to each task, without requiring any task-specific architectural changes. We evaluate our approach on three tasks: (i) Image Memorability Prediction, (ii) No-reference Image Quality Assessment, and (iii) Visual Emotion Analysis. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on all three tasks, while demonstrating improved generalization across different datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work we introduce two novel image-caption datasets for training of remote sensing foundation models. The first dataset pairs aerial and satellite imagery with captions generated by Gemini using landmarks extracted from Google Maps. The second dataset utilizes public web images and their corresponding alt-text, filtered for the remote sensing domain, resulting in a diverse dataset with greater breadth in image styles and subject matter. These datasets are used to pre-train the MaMMUT~\citep{kuo2023mammutsimplearchitecturejoint} VLM architecture, resulting in state-of-the-art generalization performance in zero-shot cross-modal retrieval on well-known public benchmarks. Finally, we present our ongoing research to distill image-level knowledge gained in the VLM contrastive training procedure to enhance the model's localization ability. Specifically, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels for image regions based on the model's attention maps and use these labels for further training. To mitigate noisy attention maps and create robust segmentation masks, we introduce a novel attention-pooling mechanism called the Smooth-Attention-Operation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aligning Vision to Language: Text-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models.

| **[Treble Counterfactual VLMs: A Causal Approach to Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06169v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multi-modal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and reasoning. However, they often generate hallucinated outputs inconsistent with the visual context or prompt, limiting reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging. Existing studies link hallucination to statistical biases, language priors, and biased feature learning but lack a structured causal understanding. In this work, we introduce a causal perspective to analyze and mitigate hallucination in VLMs. We hypothesize that hallucination arises from unintended direct influences of either the vision or text modality, bypassing proper multi-modal fusion. To address this, we construct a causal graph for VLMs and employ counterfactual analysis to estimate the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of vision, text, and their cross-modal interaction on the output. We systematically identify and mitigate these unintended direct effects to ensure that responses are primarily driven by genuine multi-modal fusion. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) designing structural causal graphs to distinguish correct fusion pathways from spurious modality shortcuts, (2) estimating modality-specific and cross-modal NDE using perturbed image representations, hallucinated text embeddings, and degraded visual inputs, and (3) implementing a test-time intervention module to dynamically adjust the model's dependence on each modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination while preserving task performance, providing a robust and interpretable framework for improving VLM reliability. To enhance accessibility and reproducibility, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/TREE985/Treble-Counterfactual-VLMs.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TREE985/Treble-Counterfactual-VLMs) |

Yet, most approaches focus on learning robust natural image priors while modeling the scene's noise statistics. In extremely low-light conditions, these methods often remain insufficient. Additional information is needed, such as multiple captures or, as suggested here, scene description. As an alternative, we propose using a text-based description of the scene as an additional prior, something the photographer can easily provide. Inspired by the remarkable success of text-guided diffusion models in image generation, we show that adding image caption information significantly improves image denoising and reconstruction for both synthetic and real-world images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  | None |

With the rise of LLMs, modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate detailed and comprehensive image descriptions. However, benchmarking the quality of such captions remains unresolved. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) How well do current VLMs actually perform on image captioning, particularly compared to humans? We built CapArena, a platform with over 6000 pairwise caption battles and high-quality human preference votes. Our arena-style evaluation marks a milestone, showing that leading models like GPT-4o achieve or even surpass human performance, while most open-source models lag behind. (2) Can automated metrics reliably assess detailed caption quality? Using human annotations from CapArena, we evaluate traditional and recent captioning metrics, as well as VLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that while some metrics (e.g., METEOR) show decent caption-level agreement with humans, their systematic biases lead to inconsistencies in model ranking. In contrast, VLM-as-a-Judge demonstrates robust discernment at both the caption and model levels. Building on these insights, we release CapArena-Auto, an accurate and efficient automated benchmark for detailed captioning, achieving 94.3% correlation with human rankings at just $4 per test.

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> | Under Review | [Code Link](https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon) |

However, human-written captions prioritize conveying a central message alongside visual descriptions using pragmatic cues. To enhance pragmatic diversity, it is essential to explore alternative ways of communicating these messages in conjunction with visual content. To address this challenge, we propose RONA, a novel prompting strategy for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) that leverages Coherence Relations as an axis for variation. We demonstrate that RONA generates captions with better overall diversity and ground-truth alignment, compared to MLLM baselines across multiple domains.

| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[GeoPix: Multi-Modal Large Language Model for Pixel-level Image Understanding in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06828v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in image- and region-level remote sensing (RS) image understanding tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding. However, existing RS MLLMs lack the pixel-level dialogue capability, which involves responding to user instructions with segmentation masks for specific instances. In this paper, we propose GeoPix, a RS MLLM that extends image understanding capabilities to the pixel level. This is achieved by equipping the MLLM with a mask predictor, which transforms visual features from the vision encoder into masks conditioned on the LLM's segmentation token embeddings. To facilitate the segmentation of multi-scale objects in RS imagery, a class-wise learnable memory module is integrated into the mask predictor to capture and store class-wise geo-context at the instance level across the entire dataset. In addition, to address the absence of large-scale datasets for training pixel-level RS MLLMs, we construct the GeoPixInstruct dataset, comprising 65,463 images and 140,412 instances, with each instance annotated with text descriptions, bounding boxes, and masks. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training strategy to balance the distinct requirements of text generation and masks prediction in multi-modal multi-task optimization. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and superiority of GeoPix in pixel-level segmentation tasks, while also maintaining competitive performance in image- and region-level benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Florenz: Scaling Laws for Systematic Generalization in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09443v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual transfer enables vision-language models (VLMs) to perform vision tasks in various languages with training data only in one language. Current approaches rely on large pre-trained multilingual language models. However, they face the curse of multilinguality, sacrificing downstream task performance for multilingual capabilities, struggling with lexical ambiguities, and falling behind recent advances. In this work, we study the scaling laws of systematic generalization with monolingual VLMs for multilingual tasks, focusing on the impact of model size and seen training samples. We propose Florenz, a monolingual encoder-decoder VLM with 0.4B to 11.2B parameters combining the pre-trained VLM Florence-2 and the large language model Gemma-2. Florenz is trained with varying compute budgets on a synthetic dataset that features intentionally incomplete language coverage for image captioning, thus, testing generalization from the fully covered translation task. We show that not only does indirectly learning unseen task-language pairs adhere to a scaling law, but also that with our data generation pipeline and the proposed Florenz model family, image captioning abilities can emerge in a specific language even when only data for the translation task is available. Fine-tuning on a mix of downstream datasets yields competitive performance and demonstrates promising scaling trends in multimodal machine translation (Multi30K, CoMMuTE), lexical disambiguation (CoMMuTE), and image captioning (Multi30K, XM3600, COCO Karpathy).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Measuring directional bias amplification in image captions using predictability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07878v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases but can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</p></details> |  | None |

We investigate using superpixels coupled with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between detector-based captioning architectures and those that solely pretrain on large datasets. Our novel superpixel approach ensures that the model receives object-like features whilst the use of VLMs provides our model with open set object understanding. Furthermore, we extend our architecture to make use of multi-resolution inputs, allowing our model to view images in different levels of detail, and use an attention mechanism to determine which parts are most relevant to the caption. We demonstrate our model's performance with multiple VLMs and through a range of ablations detailing the impact of different architectural choices. Our full model achieves a competitive CIDEr score of $136.9$ on the COCO Karpathy split.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |

Recent advancements have seen researchers exploring learning multi-modal codebook (i.e., text-aligned codebook) by utilizing image caption semantics, aiming to enhance codebook performance in cross-modal tasks. However, existing image-text paired datasets exhibit a notable flaw in that the text descriptions tend to be overly concise, failing to adequately describe the images and provide sufficient semantic knowledge, resulting in limited alignment of text and codebook at a fine-grained level. In this paper, we propose a novel Text-Augmented Codebook Learning framework, named TA-VQ, which generates longer text for each image using the visual-language model for improved text-aligned codebook learning. However, the long text presents two key challenges: how to encode text and how to align codebook and text. To tackle two challenges, we propose to split the long text into multiple granularities for encoding, i.e., word, phrase, and sentence, so that the long text can be fully encoded without losing any key semantic knowledge. Following this, a hierarchical encoder and novel sampling-based alignment strategy are designed to achieve fine-grained codebook-text alignment. Additionally, our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing VQ models. Extensive experiments in reconstruction and various downstream tasks demonstrate its effectiveness compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, the evaluation of detailed image captioning remains underexplored due to outdated evaluation metrics and coarse annotations. In this paper, we introduce DeCapBench along with a novel metric, DCScore, specifically designed for detailed captioning tasks. DCScore evaluates hallucinations and fine-grained comprehensiveness by deconstructing responses into the smallest self-sufficient units, termed primitive information units, and assessing them individually. Our evaluation shows that DCScore aligns more closely with human judgment than other rule-based or model-based metrics. Concurrently, DeCapBench exhibits a high correlation with VLM arena results on descriptive tasks, surpassing existing benchmarks for vision-language models. Additionally, we present an automatic fine-grained feedback collection method, FeedQuill, for preference optimization based on our advanced metric, showing robust generalization capabilities across auto-generated preference data. Extensive experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces hallucinations but also enhances performance across various benchmarks, achieving superior detail captioning performance while surpassing GPT-4o.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures | None |

To tackle the challenge, we identify the current lack of a metric that finely measures the caption quality in concept level. We hereby introduce HalFscore, a novel metric built upon the language graph and is designed to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of dense captions at a granular level. Additionally, we identify the root cause of hallucination as the model's over-reliance on its language prior. To address this, we propose PerturboLLaVA, which reduces the model's reliance on the language prior by incorporating adversarially perturbed text during training. This method enhances the model's focus on visual inputs, effectively reducing hallucinations and producing accurate, image-grounded descriptions without incurring additional computational overhead. PerturboLLaVA significantly improves the fidelity of generated captions, outperforming existing approaches in handling multimodal hallucinations and achieving improved performance across general multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods relying on direct distillation often struggle with low-confidence data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose CAREVL, a novel method for preference reward modeling by reliably using both high- and low-confidence data. First, a cluster of auxiliary expert models (textual reward models) innovatively leverages image captions as weak supervision signals to filter high-confidence data. The high-confidence data are then used to fine-tune the LVLM. Second, low-confidence data are used to generate diverse preference samples using the fine-tuned LVLM. These samples are then scored and selected to construct reliable chosen-rejected pairs for further training. CAREVL achieves performance improvements over traditional distillation-based methods on VL-RewardBench and MLLM-as-a-Judge benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness.

A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications.

For this reason, self-supervised image-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision applications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack of explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between image-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose image-text model, which can be effectively used off the shelf for dense and global vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights. First, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image captions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense understanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for learning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method that combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across both dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique: we propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised masked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial enhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale our model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of public images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets in total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and global understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks.

Despite significant advances in developing sophisticated methods and large-scale datasets for training vision-language models (VLMs), two critical challenges persist: the scarcity of non-English descriptive datasets and the lack of multilingual capability evaluation for models. These limitations fundamentally impede the progress and practical deployment of RSIC, particularly in the era of large VLMs. To address these challenges, this paper presents several significant contributions to the field. First, we introduce and analyze BRSIC (Bilingual Remote Sensing Image Captioning), a comprehensive bilingual dataset that enriches three established English RSIC datasets with Chinese descriptions, encompassing 13,634 images paired with 68,170 bilingual captions. Building upon this foundation, we develop a systematic evaluation framework that addresses the prevalent inconsistency in evaluation protocols, enabling rigorous assessment of model performance through standardized retraining procedures on BRSIC. Furthermore, we present an extensive empirical study of eight state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs), examining their capabilities across multiple paradigms including zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and multi-lingual training. This comprehensive evaluation provides crucial insights into the strengths and limitations of current LVLMs in handling multilingual remote sensing tasks. Additionally, our cross-dataset transfer experiments reveal interesting findings.

While MLLMs demonstrate remarkable versatility, MLLMs appears limited performance on special applications. But tuning MLLMs for downstream tasks encounters two key challenges: Task-Expert Specialization, where distribution shifts between pre-training and target datasets constrain target performance, and Open-World Stabilization, where catastrophic forgetting erases the model general knowledge. In this work, we systematically review recent advancements in MLLM tuning methodologies, classifying them into three paradigms: (I) Selective Tuning, (II) Additive Tuning, and (III) Reparameterization Tuning. Furthermore, we benchmark these tuning strategies across popular MLLM architectures and diverse downstream tasks to establish standardized evaluation analysis and systematic tuning principles. Finally, we highlight several open challenges in this domain and propose future research directions.

In low-data scenarios, standard contrastive learning can struggle to align modalities effectively due to overfitting and unstable training dynamics. In this paper, we propose a variance-aware loss scheduling approach that dynamically adjusts the weighting of the contrastive loss based on the statistical variability (uncertainty) in the model's alignment predictions. Using a subset of the Flickr8k image-caption dataset to simulate limited data conditions, we demonstrate that our approach improves image-text retrieval accuracy compared to a fixed-weight baseline. We also compare against other adaptive weighting strategies (using output entropy and cosine similarity spread) and find that variance-aware scheduling provides the best overall trade-off. Qualitatively, our method yields more distinct multimodal embeddings as shown by t-SNE visualizations. Moreover, in a stress test with noise-injected captions and images, the variance-guided loss proves more robust, maintaining higher recall when random perturbations are introduced. These results highlight the benefit of adaptive loss weighting for multimodal alignment in low-data regimes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Are Large Vision Language Models Good Game Players?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02358v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding and reasoning about both visual and textual information. However, existing evaluation methods for LVLMs, primarily based on benchmarks like Visual Question Answering and image captioning, often fail to capture the full scope of LVLMs' capabilities. These benchmarks are limited by issues such as inadequate assessment of detailed visual perception, data contamination, and a lack of focus on multi-turn reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose \method{}, a game-based evaluation framework designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' cognitive and reasoning skills in structured environments. \method{} uses a set of games to evaluate LVLMs on four core tasks: Perceiving, Question Answering, Rule Following, and End-to-End Playing, with each target task designed to assess specific abilities, including visual perception, reasoning, decision-making, etc. Based on this framework, we conduct extensive experiments that explore the limitations of current LVLMs, such as handling long structured outputs and perceiving detailed and dense elements.

| **[Locality Alignment Improves Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11087v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption in recent years, but many still struggle with basic spatial reasoning errors. We hypothesize that this is due to VLMs adopting pre-trained vision backbones, specifically vision transformers (ViTs) trained with image-level supervision and minimal inductive biases. Such models may fail to encode the class contents at each position in the image, and our goal is to resolve this with a vision backbone that effectively captures both local and global image semantics. Our main insight is that we do not require new supervision to learn this capability - pre-trained models contain significant knowledge of local semantics that we can extract and use for scalable self-supervision. We propose a new efficient post-training stage for ViTs called locality alignment and a novel fine-tuning procedure called MaskEmbed that uses a masked reconstruction loss to learn semantic contributions for each image patch. We first evaluate locality alignment with a vision-only benchmark, finding that it improves a model's performance at patch-level semantic segmentation, especially for strong backbones trained with image-caption pairs (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP). We then train a series of VLMs with and without locality alignment, and show that locality-aligned backbones improve performance across a range of benchmarks, particularly ones that involve spatial understanding (e.g., RefCOCO, OCID-Ref, TallyQA, VSR, AI2D). Overall, we demonstrate that we can efficiently learn local semantic extraction via a locality alignment stage, and that this procedure benefits VLM training recipes that use off-the-shelf vision backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-Ready</p></details> | None |
| **[Text-driven Adaptation of Foundation Models for Few-shot Surgical Workflow Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09555v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Surgical workflow analysis is crucial for improving surgical efficiency and safety. However, previous studies rely heavily on large-scale annotated datasets, posing challenges in cost, scalability, and reliance on expert annotations. To address this, we propose Surg-FTDA (Few-shot Text-driven Adaptation), designed to handle various surgical workflow analysis tasks with minimal paired image-label data. Methods: Our approach has two key components. First, Few-shot selection-based modality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings with text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap. Second, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder, eliminating the need for paired image-text data. This decoder is then applied to aligned image embeddings, enabling image-related tasks without explicit image-text pairs. Results: We evaluate our approach to generative tasks (image captioning) and discriminative tasks (triplet recognition and phase recognition). Results show that Surg-FTDA outperforms baselines and generalizes well across downstream tasks. Conclusion: We propose a text-driven adaptation approach that mitigates the modality gap and handles multiple downstream tasks in surgical workflow analysis, with minimal reliance on large annotated datasets. The code and dataset will be released in https://github.com/CAMMA-public/Surg-FTDA</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/CAMMA-public/Surg-FTDA) |

In image captioning, many state-of-the-art models have achieved impressive performances while relying on resource-intensive architectures. This made them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This limitation is particularly noticeable for applications involving low-resource languages. We demonstrate the case of image captioning in Assamese language, where lack of effective, scalable systems can restrict the accessibility of AI-based solutions for native Assamese speakers. This work presents AC-Lite, a computationally efficient model for image captioning in low-resource Assamese language. AC-Lite reduces computational requirements by replacing computation-heavy visual feature extractors like FasterRCNN with lightweight ShuffleNetv2x1.5. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are used as the caption decoder to further reduce computational demands and model parameters. Furthermore, the integration of bilinear attention enhances the model's overall performance. AC-Lite can operate on edge devices, thereby eliminating the need for computation on remote servers. The proposed AC-Lite model achieves 82.3 CIDEr score on the COCO-AC dataset with 1.098 GFLOPs and 25.65M parameters.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Group Relative Policy Optimization for Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01333v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning tasks usually use two-stage training to complete model optimization. The first stage uses cross-entropy as the loss function for optimization, and the second stage uses self-critical sequence training (SCST) for reinforcement learning optimization. However, the SCST algorithm has certain defects. SCST relies only on a single greedy decoding result as a baseline. If the model itself is not stable enough, the greedy decoding result may be relatively worst, which will lead to a high variance of advantage estimation, further leading to unstable policy updates. In addition, SCST only compares one sampling result with the greedy decoding result, and the generation diversity is limited, which may fall into a local optimum. In this paper, we propose using the latest Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning algorithm as an optimization solution for the second stage. GRPO generates multiple candidate captions for the input image and then continuously optimizes the model through intragroup comparison. By constraining the amplitude of policy updates and KL divergence, the stability of the model during training is greatly guaranteed. In addition, compared to SCST, which only samples one answer, GRPO samples and generates multiple answers. Multiple candidate answers in the group cover a wider solution space. Combined with KL divergence constraints, GRPO can improve diversity while ensuring model stability. The code for this article is available at https://github.com/liangxu-one/ms-models/tree/image_caption_grpo/research/arxiv_papers/Image_Caption_GRPO.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/liangxu-one/ms-models) |

In this paper, we propose AuroraCap, a video captioner based on a large multimodal model. We follow the simplest architecture design without additional parameters for temporal modeling. To address the overhead caused by lengthy video sequences, we implement the token merging strategy, reducing the number of input visual tokens. Surprisingly, we found that this strategy results in little performance loss. AuroraCap shows superior performance on various video and image captioning benchmarks, for example, obtaining a CIDEr of 88.9 on Flickr30k, beating GPT-4V (55.3) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (82.2). However, existing video caption benchmarks only include simple descriptions, consisting of a few dozen words, which limits research in this field. Therefore, we develop VDC, a video detailed captioning benchmark with over one thousand carefully annotated structured captions. In addition, we propose a new LLM-assisted metric VDCscore for bettering evaluation, which adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to transform long caption evaluation into multiple short question-answer pairs. With the help of human Elo ranking, our experiments show that this benchmark better correlates with human judgments of video detailed captioning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

In this work, we present the first survey and taxonomy of over 70 different image captioning metrics and their usage in hundreds of papers, specifically designed to help users select the most suitable metric for their needs. We find that despite the diversity of proposed metrics, the vast majority of studies rely on only five popular metrics, which we show to be weakly correlated with human ratings. We hypothesize that combining a diverse set of metrics can enhance correlation with human ratings. As an initial step, we demonstrate that a linear regression-based ensemble method, which we call EnsembEval, trained on one human ratings dataset, achieves improved correlation across five additional datasets, showing there is a lot of room for improvement by leveraging a diverse set of metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

This work delves into the intricacies of hallucinatory phenomena exhibited by widely used image captioners, unraveling interesting patterns. Specifically, we step upon previously introduced techniques of conceptual counterfactual explanations to address VL hallucinations. The deterministic and efficient nature of the employed conceptual counterfactuals backbone is able to suggest semantically minimal edits driven by hierarchical knowledge, so that the transition from a hallucinated caption to a non-hallucinated one is performed in a black-box manner. HalCECE, our proposed hallucination detection framework is highly interpretable, by providing semantically meaningful edits apart from standalone numbers, while the hierarchical decomposition of hallucinated concepts leads to a thorough hallucination analysis. Another novelty tied to the current work is the investigation of role hallucinations, being one of the first works to involve interconnections between visual concepts in hallucination detection. Overall, HalCECE recommends an explainable direction to the crucial field of VL hallucination detection, thus fostering trustworthy evaluation of current and future VL systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing metrics for evaluating the quality of text generated by VLMs typically focus on an overall evaluation for a specific task, such as image captioning. While the overall evaluation is essential for any task, the criteria prioritized can differ depending on the task, making it challenging for current metrics to adapt to multi-task scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose HarmonicEval, a reference-free comprehensive evaluation metric that aggregates criterion-wise scores to produce the overall score in a bottom-up manner. Furthermore, we construct the Multi-task Multi-criteria Human Evaluation (MMHE) dataset, which comprises 18,000 expert human judgments across four multi-modal tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that HarmonicEval achieves higher correlations with human judgments than conventional metrics while providing numerical scores for each criterion.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their growing importance, the security of VLMs, particularly against backdoor attacks, is under explored. Moreover, prior works often assume attackers have access to the original training data, which is often unrealistic. In this paper, we address a more practical and challenging scenario where attackers must rely solely on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. We introduce VLOOD (Backdooring Vision-Language Models with Out-of-Distribution Data), a novel approach with two key contributions: (1) demonstrating backdoor attacks on VLMs in complex image-to-text tasks while minimizing degradation of the original semantics under poisoned inputs, and (2) proposing innovative techniques for backdoor injection without requiring any access to the original training data. Our evaluation on image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks confirms the effectiveness of VLOOD, revealing a critical security vulnerability in VLMs and laying the foundation for future research on securing multimodal models against sophisticated threats.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

We participated in all the three tracks (Image Captioning, Text only and Multimodal translation tasks) for Indic languages (ie.

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of CLIP's performance limitations in multi-object contexts through controlled experiments. We introduce two custom datasets, SimCO and CompCO, to evaluate CLIP's image and text encoders in various multi-object configurations. Our findings reveal significant biases in both encoders: the image encoder favors larger objects, while the text encoder prioritizes objects mentioned first in descriptions. We hypothesize these biases originate from CLIP's training process and provide evidence through analyses of the COCO dataset and CLIP's training progression. Additionally, we extend our investigation to Stable Diffusion models, revealing that biases in the CLIP text encoder significantly impact text-to-image generation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate how these biases affect CLIP's performance in image-caption matching and generation tasks, particularly when manipulating object sizes and their order in captions. This work contributes valuable insights into CLIP's behavior in complex visual environments and highlights areas for improvement in future vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 Workshop EVAL-FoMo</p></details> | None |

Peer-reviewed journals are foundational repositories of specialized knowledge, written in discipline-specific language that differs from general Internet content used to train most large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We hypothesized that by combining a family of scientific journals with generative AI models, we could invent novel tools for scientific communication, education, and clinical care. We converted 23,000 articles from Neurosurgery Publications into a multimodal database - NeuroPubs - of 134 million words and 78,000 image-caption pairs to develop six datasets for building AI models. We showed that the content of NeuroPubs uniquely represents neurosurgery-specific clinical contexts compared with broader datasets and PubMed. For publishing, we employed generalist VLMs to automatically generate graphical abstracts from articles. Editorial board members rated 70% of these as ready for publication without further edits. For education, we generated 89,587 test questions in the style of the ABNS written board exam, which trainee and faculty neurosurgeons found indistinguishable from genuine examples 54% of the time. We used these questions alongside a curriculum learning process to track knowledge acquisition while training our 34 billion-parameter VLM (CNS-Obsidian). In a blinded, randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated the non-inferiority of CNS-Obsidian to GPT-4o (p = 0.1154) as a diagnostic copilot for a neurosurgical service. Our findings lay a novel foundation for AI with Science and establish a framework to elevate scientific communication using state-of-the-art generative artificial intelligence while maintaining rigorous quality standards.</p></details> |  | None |

The benchmark comprises four tasks: image captioning, multi-modal question answering, multi-modal fact verification, and image reranking. All tasks are set in an open-domain setting, requiring RAG models to retrieve query-relevant information from a multi-modal document collection and use it as input context for RAG modeling. To enhance the context utilization capabilities of MLLMs, we also introduce Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning (MM-RAIT), an instruction tuning method that optimizes MLLMs within multi-modal contexts.

To address this challenge, we introduce VisCon-100K, a novel dataset derived from interleaved image-text web documents. Our approach transforms 45K web documents from the OBELICS dataset into 100K image conversation samples. We utilize GPT-4V to generate image-contextual captions and OpenChat 3.5 model to convert these captions into diverse free-form and multiple-choice question-answer pairs. Integrating this dataset for fine-tuning considerably enhances VLM performance across multiple benchmarks. Unlike methods that focus solely on fine-grained visual content, our approach leverages accompanying web context, yielding superior results. We also discover that a 'leaky modality mix', where conversation samples contain questions answerable from both the image and its contextual caption, outperforms non-leaky combinations of captions and Q&A pairs. VisCon-100k dataset shows strong performance with two popular VLM approaches: text-only large language model (LLM) aligned with a vision encoder using image captions data (ShareGPT4V-7b) and multimodally pretrained LLM (IDEFICS2-8b) using interleaved image-text data. In addition to releasing the VisCon-100K dataset, we provide a contextual captioner trained on this dataset, facilitating scalable fine-tuning data generation for future research and open-source applications.

In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts.

However, they often generate hallucinations by describing non-existent objects or attributes, compromising their reliability. This study analyzes hallucination patterns in image captioning, showing that not all tokens in the generation process are influenced by image input and that image dependency can serve as a useful signal for hallucination detection. To address this, we develop an automated pipeline to identify hallucinated objects and train a token-level classifier using hidden representations from parallel inference passes-with and without image input. Leveraging this classifier, we introduce a decoding strategy that effectively controls hallucination rates in image captioning at inference time.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures | None |

While recent work addressing this issue has predominantly focused on using GPT models for data preprocessing on relatively simple public datasets, there is a need to explore a broader range of Large Language Models (LLMs) and tackle more challenging and diverse datasets. In this study, we investigate the use of multiple LLMs, including LLaMA 3.1 70B, GPT-4 Turbo, and Sonnet 3.5 v2, to refine and clean the textual outputs of BLIP and GIT. We assess the impact of LLM-assisted data cleaning by comparing downstream-task (SemEval 2024 Subtask "Multilabel Persuasion Detection in Memes") models trained on cleaned versus non-cleaned data. While our experimental results show improvements when using LLM-cleaned captions, statistical tests reveal that most of these improvements are not significant. This suggests that while LLMs have the potential to enhance data cleaning and repairing, their effectiveness may be limited depending on the context they are applied to, the complexity of the task, and the level of noise in the text. Our findings highlight the need for further research into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in data preprocessing pipelines, especially when dealing with challenging datasets, contributing empirical evidence to the ongoing discussion about integrating LLMs into data preprocessing pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel zero-shot video captioning approach that combines frame-level scene graphs from a video to obtain intermediate representations for caption generation. Our method first generates frame-level captions using an image VLM, converts them into scene graphs, and consolidates these graphs to produce comprehensive video-level descriptions. To achieve this, we leverage a lightweight graph-to-text model trained solely on text corpora, eliminating the need for video captioning annotations. Experiments on the MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions datasets show that our approach outperforms zero-shot video captioning baselines, demonstrating that aggregating frame-level scene graphs yields rich video understanding without requiring large-scale paired data or high inference cost.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Good Representation, Better Explanation: Role of Convolutional Neural Networks in Transformer-Based Remote Sensing Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16095v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) is the process of generating meaningful descriptions from remote sensing images. Recently, it has gained significant attention, with encoder-decoder models serving as the backbone for generating meaningful captions. The encoder extracts essential visual features from the input image, transforming them into a compact representation, while the decoder utilizes this representation to generate coherent textual descriptions. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information. The decoder has been well explored for text generation, whereas the encoder remains relatively unexplored. However, optimizing the encoder is crucial as it directly influences the richness of extracted features, which in turn affects the quality of generated captions. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate twelve different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures within a transformer-based encoder framework to assess their effectiveness in RSIC. The evaluation consists of two stages: first, a numerical analysis categorizes CNNs into different clusters, based on their performance. The best performing CNNs are then subjected to human evaluation from a human-centric perspective by a human annotator. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different search strategies, namely greedy search and beam search, to ensure the best caption. The results highlight the critical role of encoder selection in improving captioning performance, demonstrating that specific CNN architectures significantly enhance the quality of generated descriptions for remote sensing images. By providing a detailed comparison of multiple encoders, this study offers valuable insights to guide advances in transformer-based image captioning models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches rely on 3D point clouds, which present challenges in encoding efficiency and neural network processing. With the advent of advanced LiDAR sensors like Ouster OS1, which, in addition to 3D point clouds, produce fixed resolution depth, signal, and ambient panoramic 2D images, new opportunities emerge for LiDAR based tasks. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to connect LiDAR data with text by leveraging 2D imagery generated by the OS1 sensor instead of 3D point clouds. Using the Florence 2 large model in a zero-shot setting, we perform image captioning and object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that Florence 2 generates more informative captions and achieves superior performance in object detection tasks compared to existing methods like CLIP.

| **[Weakly Supervised Video Scene Graph Generation via Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15370v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) studies are trained in a fully supervised manner, which requires all frames in a video to be annotated, thereby incurring high annotation cost compared to Image Scene Graph Generation (ImgSGG). Although the annotation cost of VidSGG can be alleviated by adopting a weakly supervised approach commonly used for ImgSGG (WS-ImgSGG) that uses image captions, there are two key reasons that hinder such a naive adoption: 1) Temporality within video captions, i.e., unlike image captions, video captions include temporal markers (e.g., before, while, then, after) that indicate time related details, and 2) Variability in action duration, i.e., unlike human actions in image captions, human actions in video captions unfold over varying duration. To address these issues, we propose a Natural Language-based Video Scene Graph Generation (NL-VSGG) framework that only utilizes the readily available video captions for training a VidSGG model. NL-VSGG consists of two key modules: Temporality-aware Caption Segmentation (TCS) module and Action Duration Variability-aware caption-frame alignment (ADV) module. Specifically, TCS segments the video captions into multiple sentences in a temporal order based on a Large Language Model (LLM), and ADV aligns each segmented sentence with appropriate frames considering the variability in action duration. Our approach leads to a significant enhancement in performance compared to simply applying the WS-ImgSGG pipeline to VidSGG on the Action Genome dataset. As a further benefit of utilizing the video captions as weak supervision, we show that the VidSGG model trained by NL-VSGG is able to predict a broader range of action classes that are not included in the training data, which makes our framework practical in reality.</p></details> | 10 pages, ICLR 2025 | None |

However, hallucination remains a major challenge, especially in fields like healthcare where details are critical. In this work, we show how MLLMs may be enhanced to support Visual RAG (V-RAG), a retrieval-augmented generation framework that incorporates both text and visual data from retrieved images. On the MIMIC-CXR chest X-ray report generation and Multicare medical image caption generation datasets, we show that Visual RAG improves the accuracy of entity probing, which asks whether a medical entities is grounded by an image. We show that the improvements extend both to frequent and rare entities, the latter of which may have less positive training data. Downstream, we apply V-RAG with entity probing to correct hallucinations and generate more clinically accurate X-ray reports, obtaining a higher RadGraph-F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>GenAI...</summary><p>GenAI4Health - AAAI '25</p></details> | None |

Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability. This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy. To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 16 leading models on MedXpertQA. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite this, there is still a significant domain gap between the modalities of vision and language, especially when training data is scarce in few-shot settings, where only very limited data are available for training. In order to mitigate this issue, a multi-modal meta-learning framework has been proposed to bridge the gap between two frozen pretrained large vision and language models by introducing a tunable prompt connecting these two large models. For few-shot image captioning, the existing multi-model meta-learning framework utilizes a one-step prompting scheme to accumulate the visual features of input images to guide the language model, which struggles to generate accurate image descriptions with only a few training samples. Instead, we propose a chain-of-thought (CoT) meta-learning scheme as a multi-step image captioning procedure to better imitate how humans describe images. In addition, we further propose to learn different meta-parameters of the model corresponding to each CoT step in distinct subspaces to avoid interference. We evaluated our method on three commonly used image captioning datasets, i.e., MSCOCO, Flickr8k, and Flickr30k, under few-shot settings. The results of our experiments indicate that our chain-of-thought subspace meta-learning strategy is superior to the baselines in terms of performance across different datasets measured by different metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on direct tasks like image captioning or are limited to a narrow set of categories, such as humor or satire, for deep semantic understanding. To address this gap, we introduce, for the first time, a comprehensive, multi-level Chinese-based benchmark designed specifically for evaluating the understanding of implicit meanings in images. This benchmark is systematically categorized into four subtasks: surface-level content understanding, symbolic meaning interpretation, background knowledge comprehension, and implicit meaning comprehension. We propose an innovative semi-automatic method for constructing datasets, adhering to established construction protocols. Using this benchmark, we evaluate 15 open-source large vision language models (LVLMs) and GPT-4o, revealing that even the best-performing model lags behind human performance by nearly 14% in understanding implicit meaning. Our findings underscore the intrinsic challenges current LVLMs face in grasping nuanced visual semantics, highlighting significant opportunities for future research and development in this domain. We will publicly release our InsightVision dataset, code upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures | None |

The dynamic nature of video also complicates the design of multimodal models that can effectively caption these sequences. However, we find that by using minimal computational resources and without complex modifications to address video dynamics, an image-based model can be repurposed to outperform several specialised video captioning systems. Our adapted model demonstrates top tier performance on major benchmarks, ranking 2nd on MSRVTT and MSVD, and 3rd on VATEX. We transform it into a competitive video captioner by post training a typical image captioning model BLIP2 with only 6,000 video text pairs and simply concatenating frames (significantly fewer data than other methods), which use 2.5 to 144 million pairs. From a resource optimization perspective, this video captioning study focuses on three fundamental factors: optimizing model scale, maximizing data efficiency, and incorporating reinforcement learning. This extensive study demonstrates that a lightweight, image based adaptation strategy can rival state-of-the-art video captioning systems, offering a practical solution for low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025).

However, training these models requires large-scale datasets, which brings challenges related to efficiency, effectiveness, quality, and privacy of web data. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis and curation method for generating image-caption pairs. Unlike traditional methods, where captions are generated from images, SynthVLM utilizes advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically synthesize and select high-resolution images from text descriptions, thereby creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. To demonstrate the power of SynthVLM, we introduce SynthVLM-100K, a high-quality dataset consisting of 100,000 curated and synthesized image-caption pairs. In both model and human evaluations, SynthVLM-100K outperforms traditional real-world datasets. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B, which achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various vision question-answering (VQA) tasks. Notably, our models outperform LLaVA across most metrics with only 18\% pretrain data. Furthermore, SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B attain SOTA performance on the MMLU benchmark, demonstrating that the high-quality SynthVLM-100K dataset preserves language abilities.

Still, despite advancements such as the CLIPScore metric, multilingual captioning evaluation has remained relatively unexplored. This work presents several strategies, and extensive experiments, related to evaluating CLIPScore variants in multilingual settings. To address the lack of multilingual test data, we consider two different strategies: (1) using quality aware machine-translated datasets with human judgements, and (2) re-purposing multilingual datasets that target semantic inference and reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of finetuned multilingual models to generalize across languages and to handle complex linguistic challenges. Tests with machine-translated data show that multilingual CLIPScore models can maintain a high correlation with human judgements across different languages, and additional tests with natively multilingual and multicultural data further attest to the high-quality assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Findings of NAACL 2025</p></details> | None |

Towards Visual Instruction-Free Fine-tuning for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11427v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual instruction tuning has become the predominant technology in eliciting the multimodal task-solving capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Despite the success, as visual instructions require images as the input, it would leave the gap in inheriting the task-solving capabilities from the backbone LLMs, and make it costly to collect a large-scale dataset. To address it, we propose ViFT, a visual instruction-free fine-tuning framework for LVLMs. In ViFT, we only require the text-only instructions and image caption data during training, to separately learn the task-solving and visual perception abilities. During inference, we extract and combine the representations of the text and image inputs, for fusing the two abilities to fulfill multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ViFT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several visual reasoning and visual instruction following benchmarks, with rather less training data. Our code and data will be publicly released.</p></details> | under review | None |

These models embed multimodal facts within their parameters, rather than relying on external knowledge bases to store factual information explicitly. However, the content discerned by LVLMs may deviate from factuality due to inherent bias or incorrect inference. To address this issue, we introduce MFC-Bench, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of LVLMs across three stages of verdict prediction for MFC: Manipulation, Out-of-Context, and Veracity Classification. Through our evaluation on MFC-Bench, we benchmarked a dozen diverse and representative LVLMs, uncovering that current models still fall short in multimodal fact-checking and demonstrate insensitivity to various forms of manipulated content. We hope that MFC-Bench could raise attention to the trustworthy AI potentially assisted by LVLMs in the future. The MFC-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://github.com/wskbest/MFC-Bench, contributing to ongoing research in the multimodal fact-checking field.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/wskbest/MFC-Bench) |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted to incorporate external knowledge into LLMs; however, existing RAG-based methods rely on separate retrieval banks, introducing computational overhead and limiting the utilization of LLMs' inherent zero-shot capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose TPCap, a novel trigger-augmented and multi-modal purification framework for zero-shot image captioning without external retrieval libraries. TPCap consists of two key components: trigger-augmented (TA) generation and multi-modal purification (MP). The TA module employs a trigger projector with frozen and learnable projections to activate LLMs' contextual reasoning, enhance visual-textual alignment, and mitigate data bias. The MP module further refines the generated entity-related information by filtering noise and enhancing feature quality, ensuring more precise and factually consistent captions. We evaluate TPCap on COCO, NoCaps, Flickr30k, and WHOOPS datasets. With only 0.82M trainable parameters and training on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, TPCap achieves competitive performance comparable to state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like image captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.</p></details> |  | None |

Alternatively, smaller VLMs prioritize high-level scene descriptions, overlooking finer details that contribute to a richer understanding of an image. In this paper, we introduce a training-free framework that enhances caption diversity and informativeness by explicitly attending to distinct image regions using a comparably small VLM, BLIP, as the backbone. Our approach leverages structured segmentation to produce hierarchical representations that capture both global and localized semantics. Without requiring additional model training, we demonstrate that our method allows smaller VLMs to achieve performance comparable to larger models in terms of image-caption alignment, semantic integrity, and diversity. We evaluate our framework on MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Nocaps test datasets, achieving a Div-2 score of 0.735, 0.750, and 0.748 for each dataset respectively, while maintaining strong image-caption relevancy and semantic integrity with the human-annotated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives. However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS. This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures | None |

In this setup, a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts feature representations from the input image, which then guide the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence caption generation process. Although much research has focused on refining the decoder, the quality of image representations from the encoder remains crucial for accurate captioning. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates features from two distinct CNN based encoders, capturing complementary information to enhance caption generation. Additionally, we propose a weighted averaging technique to combine the outputs of all GRUs in the stacked decoder. Furthermore, a comparison-based beam search strategy is incorporated to refine caption selection. The results demonstrate that our fusion-based approach, along with the enhanced stacked decoder, significantly outperforms both the transformer-based state-of-the-art model and other LSTM-based baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs, efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel Instruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) task.</p></details> |  | None |

In this perspective paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of negation constructs, illustrating how structural, semantic, and cultural factors influence multimodal foundation models. We present open research questions and highlight key challenges, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues to achieve robust negation handling. Finally, we advocate for specialized benchmarks, language-specific tokenization, fine-grained attention mechanisms, and advanced multimodal architectures.

Central to our investigation is the role of question templates in guiding VLMs to generate accurate answers. We identify that specific templates significantly influence VQA outcomes, underscoring the need for strategic template selection. Another pivotal aspect of our study is augmenting VLMs with image captions, providing them with additional visual cues alongside direct image features in VQA tasks. Surprisingly, this augmentation significantly improves the VLMs' performance in many cases, even though VLMs "see" the image directly! We explore chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and find that while standard CoT reasoning causes drops in performance, advanced methods like self-consistency can help recover it. Furthermore, we find that text-only few-shot examples enhance VLMs' alignment with the task format, particularly benefiting models prone to verbose zero-shot answers. Lastly, to mitigate the challenges associated with evaluating free-form open-ended VQA responses using string-matching based VQA metrics, we introduce a straightforward LLM-guided pre-processing technique to adapt the model responses to the expected ground-truth answer distribution. In summary, our research sheds light on the intricacies of prompting strategies in VLMs for VQA, emphasizing the synergistic use of captions, templates, and pre-processing to enhance model efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/rabiulcste/vqazero</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/rabiulcste/vqazero) |

In this paper, we evaluate their multilingual, multimodal capabilities by testing on a visual reasoning task. We observe that proprietary systems like GPT-4V obtain the best performance on this task now, but open models lag in comparison. Surprisingly, GPT-4V exhibits similar performance between English and other languages, indicating the potential for equitable system development across languages. Our analysis on model failures reveals three key aspects that make this task challenging: multilinguality, complex reasoning, and multimodality. To address these challenges, we propose three targeted interventions including a translate-test approach to tackle multilinguality, a visual programming approach to break down complex reasoning, and a method that leverages image captioning to address multimodality. Our interventions achieve the best open performance on this task in a zero-shot setting, boosting open models LLaVA-v1.5-13B by 13.4%, LLaVA-v1.6-34B by 20.3%, and Qwen-VL by 16.7%, while also minorly improving GPT-4V's performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Can these stories be told via image captioning? Images from folklore genres, such as mythology, folk dance, cultural signs, and symbols, are vital to every culture. Our research compares the performance of four popular vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA, and OpenFlamingo) in identifying culturally specific information in such images and creating accurate and culturally sensitive image captions. We also propose a new evaluation metric, the Cultural Awareness Score (CAS), which measures the degree of cultural awareness in image captions. We provide a dataset MOSAIC-1.5k labeled with ground truth for images containing cultural background and context and a labeled dataset with assigned Cultural Awareness Scores that can be used with unseen data.

| **[Linear Alignment of Vision-language Models for Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05591v4)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language models like CLIP have advanced the state of the art in a variety of multi-modal tasks including image captioning and caption evaluation. Many approaches leverage CLIP for cross-modal retrieval to condition pre-trained language models on visual input. However, CLIP generally suffers from a mis-alignment of image and text modalities in the joint embedding space. We investigate efficient methods to linearly re-align the joint embedding space for the downstream task of image captioning. This leads to an efficient training protocol that merely requires computing a closed-form solution for a linear mapping in the joint CLIP space. Consequently, we propose a lightweight captioning method called ReCap, which can be trained up to 1000 times faster than existing lightweight methods. Moreover, we propose two new learning-based image-captioning metrics built on CLIP score along with our proposed alignment. We evaluate ReCap on MS-COCO, Flickr30k, VizWiz and MSRVTT. On the former two, ReCap performs comparably to state-of-the-art lightweight methods using rule-based metrics while outperforming them on most of the CLIP-based metrics. On the latter two benchmarks, ReCap consistently outperforms competitors across all metrics and exhibits strong transfer capabilities and resilience to noise. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics correlate stronger with human judgement than existing metrics on the Flickr8k-Expert, Flickr8k-Crowdflower, and THumB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (+ references and appendix)</p></details> | None |

However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging the Visual Gap: Fine-Tuning Multimodal Models with Knowledge-Adapted Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09018v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> | None |

However, merely extracting text is insufficient when dealing with complex documents. Fully comprehending such documents requires an understanding of their structure -- including formatting, formulas, tables, and the reading order of multiple blocks and columns across multiple pages -- as well as semantic information for detecting elements like footnotes and image captions. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for downstream tasks such as retrieval, document question answering, and data curation for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this, we introduce \'Eclair, a general-purpose text-extraction tool specifically designed to process a wide range of document types. Given an image, \'Eclair is able to extract formatted text in reading order, along with bounding boxes and their corresponding semantic classes. To thoroughly evaluate these novel capabilities, we introduce our diverse human-annotated benchmark for document-level OCR and semantic classification. \'Eclair achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this benchmark, outperforming other methods across key metrics. Additionally, we evaluate \'Eclair on established benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and strength across several evaluation standards.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Decoder-Only LLMs are Better Controllers for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04412v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Groundbreaking advancements in text-to-image generation have recently been achieved with the emergence of diffusion models. These models exhibit a remarkable ability to generate highly artistic and intricately detailed images based on textual prompts. However, obtaining desired generation outcomes often necessitates repetitive trials of manipulating text prompts just like casting spells on a magic mirror, and the reason behind that is the limited capability of semantic understanding inherent in current image generation models. Specifically, existing diffusion models encode the text prompt input with a pre-trained encoder structure, which is usually trained on a limited number of image-caption pairs. The state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) based on the decoder-only structure have shown a powerful semantic understanding capability as their architectures are more suitable for training on very large-scale unlabeled data. In this work, we propose to enhance text-to-image diffusion models by borrowing the strength of semantic understanding from large language models, and devise a simple yet effective adapter to allow the diffusion models to be compatible with the decoder-only structure. Meanwhile, we also provide a supporting theoretical analysis with various architectures (e.g., encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only), and conduct extensive empirical evaluations to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the enhanced models with our adapter module are superior to the stat-of-the-art models in terms of text-to-image generation quality and reliability.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods adopt a two-stage pipeline: weakly supervised pre-training with image captions and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fully annotated scene graphs. Nonetheless, they omit explicit modeling of interacting objects and treat all objects equally, resulting in mismatched relation pairs. To this end, we propose an interaction-aware OVSGG framework INOVA. During pre-training, INOVA employs an interaction-aware target generation strategy to distinguish interacting objects from non-interacting ones. In SFT, INOVA devises an interaction-guided query selection tactic to prioritize interacting objects during bipartite graph matching. Besides, INOVA is equipped with an interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to enhance the robustness by pushing interacting object pairs away from the background. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks (VG and GQA) show that INOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-aware mechanisms for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.</p></details> |  | None |

Building upon the COCO dataset with advanced COCONut panoptic masks, this dataset aims to overcome limitations in existing image-text datasets that often lack detailed, scene-comprehensive descriptions. The COCONut-PanCap dataset incorporates fine-grained, region-level captions grounded in panoptic segmentation masks, ensuring consistency and improving the detail of generated captions. Through human-edited, densely annotated descriptions, COCONut-PanCap supports improved training of vision-language models (VLMs) for image understanding and generative models for text-to-image tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that COCONut-PanCap significantly boosts performance across understanding and generation tasks, offering complementary benefits to large-scale datasets. This dataset sets a new benchmark for evaluating models on joint panoptic segmentation and grounded captioning tasks, addressing the need for high-quality, detailed image-text annotations in multi-modal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://xdeng7.github.io/coconut.github.io/coconut_pancap.html</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xdeng7.github.io/coconut.github.io) |

Existing methods seek to mitigate these risks by applying constrained adversarial fine-tuning to CLIP vision encoders on ImageNet-scale data, ensuring their generalization ability is preserved. However, this limited adversarial training restricts robustness and broader generalization. In this work, we explore an alternative approach of leveraging existing vision classification models that have been adversarially pre-trained on large-scale data. Our analysis reveals two principal contributions: (1) the extensive scale and diversity of adversarial pre-training enables these models to demonstrate superior robustness against diverse adversarial threats, ranging from imperceptible perturbations to advanced jailbreaking attempts, without requiring additional adversarial training, and (2) end-to-end MLLM integration with these robust models facilitates enhanced adaptation of language components to robust visual features, outperforming existing plug-and-play methodologies on complex reasoning tasks. Through systematic evaluation across visual question-answering, image captioning, and jail-break attacks, we demonstrate that MLLMs trained with these robust models achieve superior adversarial robustness while maintaining favorable clean performance. Our framework achieves 2x and 1.5x average robustness gains in captioning and VQA tasks, respectively, and delivers over 10% improvement against jailbreak attacks.

Much current work in this area now uses transformers, applying a metaphor of machine translation from code to function names. Still, function naming models face challenges in generalizing to projects unrelated to the training set. In this paper, we take a completely new approach by transferring advances in automated image captioning to the domain of binary reverse engineering, such that different parts of a binary function can be associated with parts of its name. We propose BLens, which combines multiple binary function embeddings into a new ensemble representation, aligns it with the name representation latent space via a contrastive learning approach, and generates function names with a transformer architecture tailored for function names. Our experiments demonstrate that BLens significantly outperforms the state of the art. In the usual setting of splitting per binary, we achieve an $F_1$ score of 0.79 compared to 0.70. In the cross-project setting, which emphasizes generalizability, we achieve an $F_1$ score of 0.46 compared to 0.29. Finally, in an experimental setting reducing shared components across projects, we achieve an $F_1$ score of $0.32$ compared to $0.19$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (Usenix 2025). 20 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Visual Attention Never Fades: Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration for Detailed Image Captioning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01419v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detailed image captioning is essential for tasks like data generation and aiding visually impaired individuals. High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging this multi-modal information effectively for VAD poses a significant challenge, as the model must identify action-relevant cues with precision. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-modal VAD architecture, referred to as the Joint Actor-centric Visual, Audio, Language Encoder (JoVALE). JoVALE is the first VAD method to integrate audio and visual features with scene descriptive context sourced from large-capacity image captioning models. At the heart of JoVALE is the actor-centric aggregation of audio, visual, and scene descriptive information, enabling adaptive integration of crucial features for recognizing each actor's actions. We have developed a Transformer-based architecture, the Actor-centric Multi-modal Fusion Network, specifically designed to capture the dynamic interactions among actors and their multi-modal contexts. Our evaluation on three prominent VAD benchmarks, including AVA, UCF101-24, and JHMDB51-21, demonstrates that incorporating multi-modal information significantly enhances performance, setting new state-of-the-art performances in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025, 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> | None |

Debunking them requires (1) providing the true context of the image and (2) checking the veracity of the image's caption. However, existing automated fact-checking methods fail to tackle both objectives explicitly. In this work, we introduce COVE, a new method that predicts first the true COntext of the image and then uses it to predict the VEracity of the caption. COVE beats the SOTA context prediction model on all context items, often by more than five percentage points. It is competitive with the best veracity prediction models on synthetic data and outperforms them on real-world data, showing that it is beneficial to combine the two tasks sequentially. Finally, we conduct a human study that reveals that the predicted context is a reusable and interpretable artifact to verify new out-of-context captions for the same image.

The latency improvement and accuracy in these techniques crucially depend on the criteria used to make exit decisions. We propose a new decision criterion where exit classifiers are treated as experts BEEM and aggregate their confidence scores. The confidence scores are aggregated only if neighbouring experts are consistent in prediction as the samples pass through them, thus capturing their ensemble effect. A sample exits when the aggregated confidence value exceeds a threshold. The threshold is set using the error rates of the intermediate exits aiming to surpass the performance of conventional DNN inference. Experimental results on the COCO dataset for Image captioning and GLUE datasets for various language tasks demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of state-of-the-art EE methods, achieving improvements in speed-up by a factor 1.5x to 2.1x. When compared to the final layer, its accuracy is comparable in harder Image Captioning and improves in the easier language tasks.

Achieving human-level recognition of the apparent emotion of a person in real world situations remains an unsolved task in computer vision. Facial expressions are not enough: body pose, contextual knowledge, and commonsense reasoning all contribute to how humans perform this emotional theory of mind task. In this paper, we examine two major approaches enabled by recent large vision language models: 1) image captioning followed by a language-only LLM, and 2) vision language models, under zero-shot and fine-tuned setups. We evaluate the methods on the Emotions in Context (EMOTIC) dataset and demonstrate that a vision language model, fine-tuned even on a small dataset, can significantly outperform traditional baselines.

Conventional image captioning models are not able to generate appropriate instructions because their architectures are typically optimized for single-image. In this study, we propose a model that handles both the target object and receptacle to generate free-form instruction sentences for mobile manipulation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel training method that effectively incorporates the scores from both learning-based and n-gram based automatic evaluation metrics as rewards. This method enables the model to learn the co-occurrence relationships between words and appropriate paraphrases. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods including representative multimodal large language models on standard automatic evaluation metrics.

For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</p></details> |  | None |

It is about predicting the most accurate caption given a specific image or video. The research community has achieved impressive results by continuously proposing new models and approaches to improve the overall model's performance. Nevertheless, despite increasing proposals, the performance metrics used to measure their advances have remained practically untouched through the years. A probe of that, nowadays metrics like BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE are still very used, aside from more sophisticated metrics such as BertScore and ClipScore. Hence, it is essential to adjust how are measure the advances, limitations, and scopes of the new image captioning proposals, as well as to adapt new metrics to these new advanced image captioning approaches. This work proposes a new evaluation metric for the image captioning problem. To do that, first, it was generated a human-labeled dataset to assess to which degree the captions correlate with the image's content. Taking these human scores as ground truth, we propose a new metric, and compare it with several well-known metrics, from classical to newer ones. Outperformed results were also found, and interesting insights were presented and discussed.</p></details> | 28 pages | None |

Variations in molecular images and caption subtasks pose a significant challenge in both image representation learning and task modeling. Yet, existing methods only focus on a specific caption task that translates a molecular image into its graph structure, i.e., OCSR. In this paper, we propose the Optical Chemical Structure Understanding (OCSU) task, which extends OCSR to molecular image caption from motif level to molecule level and abstract level. We present two approaches for that, including an OCSR-based method and an end-to-end OCSR-free method. The proposed Double-Check achieves SOTA OCSR performance on real-world patent and journal article scenarios via attentive feature enhancement for local ambiguous atoms. Cascading with SMILES-based molecule understanding methods, it can leverage the power of existing task-specific models for OCSU. While Mol-VL is an end-to-end optimized VLM-based model. An OCSU dataset, Vis-CheBI20, is built based on the widely used CheBI20 dataset for training and evaluation. Extensive experimental results on Vis-CheBI20 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Improving OCSR capability can lead to a better OCSU performance for OCSR-based approach, and the SOTA performance of Mol-VL demonstrates the great potential of end-to-end approach.</p></details> |  | None |

However, previous works only utilize the retrieved text as text prompts, and the visual information relies only on the CLIP visual embedding. Because of this issue, there is a limitation that the image descriptions inherent in the prompt are not sufficiently reflected in the visual embedding space. To tackle this issue, we propose ViPCap, a novel retrieval text-based visual prompt for lightweight image captioning. ViPCap leverages the retrieved text with image information as visual prompts to enhance the ability of the model to capture relevant visual information. By mapping text prompts into the CLIP space and generating multiple randomized Gaussian distributions, our method leverages sampling to explore randomly augmented distributions and effectively retrieves the semantic features that contain image information. These retrieved features are integrated into the image and designated as the visual prompt, leading to performance improvements on the datasets such as COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps. Experimental results demonstrate that ViPCap significantly outperforms prior lightweight captioning models in efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating the potential for a plug-and-play solution.

Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar captions given an image. In this paper, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed Visual Minimal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions. The image pair and caption pair contain minimal changes, i.e., only one aspect changes at a time from among the following: object, attribute, count, and spatial relation. These changes test the models' understanding of objects, attributes (such as color, material, shape), counts, and spatial relationships between objects. We built an automatic framework using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators. Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities. We also generate a large-scale training dataset to finetune CLIP and Idefics2, showing significant improvements in fine-grained understanding across benchmarks and in CLIP's general image-text alignment.

| **[An Ensemble Model with Attention Based Mechanism for Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14828v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning creates informative text from an input image by creating a relationship between the words and the actual content of an image. Recently, deep learning models that utilize transformers have been the most successful in automatically generating image captions. The capabilities of transformer networks have led to notable progress in several activities related to vision. In this paper, we thoroughly examine transformer models, emphasizing the critical role that attention mechanisms play. The proposed model uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to create textual captions and a deep learning convolutional neural network to extract features from the images. To create the captions, we present a novel ensemble learning framework that improves the richness of the generated captions by utilizing several deep neural network architectures based on a voting mechanism that chooses the caption with the highest bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score. The proposed model was evaluated using publicly available datasets. Using the Flickr8K dataset, the proposed model achieved the highest BLEU-[1-3] scores with rates of 0.728, 0.495, and 0.323, respectively. The suggested model outperformed the latest methods in Flickr30k datasets, determined by BLEU-[1-4] scores with rates of 0.798, 0.561, 0.387, and 0.269, respectively. The model efficacy was also obtained by the Semantic propositional image caption evaluation (SPICE) metric with a scoring rate of 0.164 for the Flicker8k dataset and 0.387 for the Flicker30k. Finally, ensemble learning significantly advances the process of image captioning and, hence, can be leveraged in various applications across different domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing methods either distill the caption from the LMM models or construct the captions from the internet images or by human. We propose to leverage off-the-shelf visual specialists, which were trained from annotated images initially not for image captioning, for enhancing the image caption. Our approach, named DCE, explores object low-level and fine-grained attributes (e.g., depth, emotion and fine-grained categories) and object relations (e.g., relative location and human-object-interaction (HOI)), and combine the attributes into the descriptive caption. Experiments demonstrate that such visual specialists are able to improve the performance for visual understanding tasks as well as reasoning that benefits from more accurate visual understanding. We will release the source code and the pipeline so that other visual specialists are easily combined into the pipeline.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a target-aware prompting strategy. This method first extracts object labels and their spatial information from the image using an object detector. Then, an attribute predictor further refines the semantic features of the objects. These refined features are subsequently integrated and fed into the decoder, enhancing the model's understanding of the image context. Experimental results on the COCO and nocaps datasets demonstrate that OPCap effectively mitigates hallucination and significantly improves the quality of generated captions.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike previous approaches that resort to lightweight adversarial fine-tuning of a pre-trained CLIP model, we perform large-scale adversarial vision-language pre-training from scratch using web-scale data. We then strengthen the defense by incorporating adversarial visual instruction tuning. The resulting models from each stage, $\Delta$CLIP and $\Delta^2$LLaVA, show substantially enhanced zero-shot robustness and set a new state-of-the-art in adversarial defense for vision-language models. For example, the adversarial robustness of $\Delta$CLIP surpasses that of the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20%. %For example, $\Delta$CLIP surpasses the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20% in terms of adversarial robustness. Similarly, compared to prior art, $\Delta^2$LLaVA brings a ~30% robustness improvement to image captioning task and a ~20% robustness improvement to visual question answering task. Furthermore, our models exhibit stronger zero-shot recognition capability, fewer hallucinations, and superior reasoning performance compared to baselines.

However, progress toward generalist biomedical VLMs is limited by the lack of annotated, publicly accessible datasets across biology and medicine. Existing efforts are restricted to narrow domains, missing the full diversity of biomedical knowledge encoded in scientific literature. To address this gap, we introduce BIOMEDICA, a scalable, open-source framework to extract, annotate, and serialize the entirety of the PubMed Central Open Access subset into an easy-to-use, publicly accessible dataset. Our framework produces a comprehensive archive with over 24 million unique image-text pairs from over 6 million articles. Metadata and expert-guided annotations are also provided. We demonstrate the utility and accessibility of our resource by releasing BMCA-CLIP, a suite of CLIP-style models continuously pre-trained on the BIOMEDICA dataset via streaming, eliminating the need to download 27 TB of data locally. On average, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across 40 tasks - spanning pathology, radiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, surgery, molecular biology, parasitology, and cell biology - excelling in zero-shot classification with a 6.56% average improvement (as high as 29.8% and 17.5% in dermatology and ophthalmology, respectively), and stronger image-text retrieval, all while using 10x less compute. To foster reproducibility and collaboration, we release our codebase and dataset for the broader research community.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite strong performance, LMMs are not directly suited for foundational discriminative vision-language tasks (i.e., tasks requiring discrete label predictions) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for discriminative tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative models. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach for finding features in the model's latent space to more effectively leverage LMMs for discriminative tasks. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 1\% of the heads) in LMMs as strong features for VL tasks. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of discriminative tasks. Our experiments also imply that SAVs can scale in performance with additional examples and generalize to similar tasks, establishing SAVs as both effective and robust multimodal feature representations.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634. Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.

Yet, they often encounter difficulty while solving complex physics problems that require arithmetic calculation and a good understanding of concepts. Moreover, many physics problems include images that contain important details required to understand the problem's context. We propose an LMM-based chatbot to answer multimodal physics MCQs. For domain adaptation, we utilize the MM-PhyQA dataset comprising Indian high school-level multimodal physics problems. To improve the LMM's performance, we experiment with two techniques, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and Image Captioning. In image captioning, we add a detailed explanation of the diagram in each image, minimizing hallucinations and image processing errors. We further explore the integration of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methodology inspired by the ranking approach in RLHF to enhance the human-like problem-solving abilities of the models. The RLHF approach incorporates human feedback into the learning process of LLMs, improving the model's problem-solving skills, truthfulness, and reasoning capabilities, minimizing the hallucinations in the answers, and improving the quality instead of using vanilla-supervised fine-tuned models. We employ the LLaVA open-source model to answer multimodal physics MCQs and compare the performance with and without using RLHF.</p></details> |  | None |

As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.</p></details> |  | None |

The typical feedback at training time, i.e., preferences of choice given two samples, does not naturally transfer to the inference phase. We introduce a novel type of feedback -- caption reformulations -- and train models to mimic reformulation feedback based on human annotations. Our method does not require training the image captioning model itself, thereby demanding substantially less computational effort. We experiment with two types of reformulation feedback: first, we collect a dataset of human reformulations that correct errors in the generated captions. We find that incorporating reformulation models trained on this data into the inference phase of existing image captioning models results in improved captions, especially when the original captions are of low quality. We apply our method to non-English image captioning, a domain where robust models are less prevalent, and gain substantial improvement. Second, we apply reformulations to style transfer. Quantitative evaluations reveal state-of-the-art performance on German image captioning and English style transfer, while human validation with a detailed comparative framework exposes the specific axes of improvement.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating Image Caption via Cycle-consistent Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03567v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating image captions typically relies on reference captions, which are costly to obtain and exhibit significant diversity and subjectivity. While reference-free evaluation metrics have been proposed, most focus on cross-modal evaluation between captions and images. Recent research has revealed that the modality gap generally exists in the representation of contrastive learning-based multi-modal systems, undermining the reliability of cross-modality metrics like CLIPScore. In this paper, we propose CAMScore, a cyclic reference-free automatic evaluation metric for image captioning models. To circumvent the aforementioned modality gap, CAMScore utilizes a text-to-image model to generate images from captions and subsequently evaluates these generated images against the original images. Furthermore, to provide fine-grained information for a more comprehensive evaluation, we design a three-level evaluation framework for CAMScore that encompasses pixel-level, semantic-level, and objective-level perspectives. Extensive experiment results across multiple benchmark datasets show that CAMScore achieves a superior correlation with human judgments compared to existing reference-based and reference-free metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework.</p></details> |  | None |

MLLMs demonstrate capabilities such as generating image captions and answering image-based questions, bridging the gap towards real-world human-computer interactions and hinting at a potential pathway to artificial general intelligence. However, MLLMs still face challenges in addressing the semantic gap in multimodal data, which may lead to erroneous outputs, posing potential risks to society. Selecting the appropriate modality alignment method is crucial, as improper methods might require more parameters without significant performance improvements. This paper aims to explore modality alignment methods for LLMs and their current capabilities. Implementing effective modality alignment can help LLMs address environmental issues and enhance accessibility. The study surveys existing modality alignment methods for MLLMs, categorizing them into four groups: (1) Multimodal Converter, which transforms data into a format that LLMs can understand; (2) Multimodal Perceiver, which improves how LLMs percieve different types of data; (3) Tool Learning, which leverages external tools to convert data into a common format, usually text; and (4) Data-Driven Method, which teaches LLMs to understand specific data types within datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE | None |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

Towards systematic study of such issues, we introduce a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning (AVR), comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. We seek strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of the tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., S2H generalization. This synthetic framework, where each task also has a text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance, and how it is impacted by training strategy. Ablations highlight the importance of explicit image-to-text conversion in promoting S2H generalization when using auto-regressive training. We also report results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon, including a measure of gradient alignment that seems to identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present an alternative method for decoding brain signals into image captions by predicting a DINOv2 model's embedding of an image from the corresponding fMRI signal and then providing its [CLS] token as the prefix to the GPT-2 language model which decreases computational requirements considerably. Additionally, instead of commonly used Linear Regression, we explore 3D Convolutional Neural Network mapping of fMRI signals to image embedding space for better accounting positional information of voxels.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure</p></details> | None |

The remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion model presents the potential to resolve this task by employing synthetic image-caption pairs generated by this pre-trained prior. Nonetheless, the defective details in the salient regions of the synthetic images introduce semantic misalignment between the synthetic image and text, leading to compromised results. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Patch-wise Cross-modal feature Mix-up (PCM) mechanism to adaptively mitigate the unfaithful contents in a fine-grained manner during training, which can be integrated into most of encoder-decoder frameworks, introducing our PCM-Net. Specifically, for each input image, salient visual concepts in the image are first detected considering the image-text similarity in CLIP space. Next, the patch-wise visual features of the input image are selectively fused with the textual features of the salient visual concepts, leading to a mixed-up feature map with less defective content. Finally, a visual-semantic encoder is exploited to refine the derived feature map, which is further incorporated into the sentence decoder for caption generation. Additionally, to facilitate the model training with synthetic data, a novel CLIP-weighted cross-entropy loss is devised to prioritize the high-quality image-text pairs over the low-quality counterparts. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PCM-Net compared with state-of-the-art VLMs-based approaches. It is noteworthy that our PCM-Net ranks first in both in-domain and cross-domain zero-shot image captioning.

They can generate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions of images. However, they still face challenges in accurately identifying and counting objects and determining their spatial locations, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping or small objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which introduces structured scene graphs to enhance object recognition, relationship identification, and spatial understanding within images. Our framework improves the MLLM's capacity to handle tasks requiring precise visual descriptions, especially in scenarios with challenging perspectives, such as aerial views or scenes with dense object arrangements. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the VG-150 dataset that focuses on first-person visual understanding and the AUG dataset that involves aerial imagery. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing MLLMs in VQA tasks, which stands out in recognizing, localizing, and quantifying objects in different spatial contexts and provides more accurate visual descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

Existing works typically have two shortcomings. First, they caption images from scratch, ignoring existing alt-text metadata, and second, lack transparency if the captioners' training data (e.g. GPT) is unknown. In this paper, we study a principled approach Altogether based on the key idea to edit and re-align existing alt-texts associated with the images. To generate training data, we perform human annotation where annotators start with the existing alt-text and re-align it to the image content in multiple rounds, consequently constructing captions with rich visual concepts. This differs from prior work that carries out human annotation as a one-time description task solely based on images and annotator knowledge. We train a captioner on this data that generalizes the process of re-aligning alt-texts at scale. Our results show our Altogether approach leads to richer image captions that also improve text-to-image generation and zero-shot image classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by EMNLP 2024; Meta CLIP 1.2 Data Engine</p></details> | None |

To mitigate these risks, researchers have applied various technological methods to identify the ergonomic risks that construction workers face. However, traditional ergonomic risk assessment (ERA) techniques do not offer interactive feedback. The rapidly developing vision-language models (VLMs), capable of generating textual descriptions or answering questions about ergonomic risks based on image inputs, have not yet received widespread attention. This research introduces an interactive visual query system tailored to assess the postural ergonomic risks of construction workers. The system's capabilities include visual question answering (VQA), which responds to visual queries regarding workers' exposure to postural ergonomic risks, and image captioning (IC), which generates textual descriptions of these risks from images. Additionally, this study proposes a dataset designed for training and testing such methodologies. Systematic testing indicates that the VQA functionality delivers an accuracy of 96.5%. Moreover, evaluations using nine metrics for IC and assessments from human experts indicate that the proposed approach surpasses the performance of a method using the same architecture trained solely on generic datasets. This study sets a new direction for future developments in interactive ERA using generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures | None |

Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments.

Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation.

Previous Transformer-based models struggled to integrate visual and textual information under limited supervision. In response, we propose a novel vision-language model for retinal image captioning that combines visual and textual features through a guided context self-attention mechanism. This approach captures both intricate details and the global clinical context, even in data-scarce scenarios.

However, most models rely on text-based instructions, limiting their effectiveness in human-machine interactions. Moreover, the quality of language models depends on reasoning and prompting techniques, such as COT, which remain underexplored when using speech instructions. To address these challenges, we propose SilVar, a novel end-to-end multimodal model that uses speech instructions for reasoning in visual question answering. In addition, we investigate reasoning techniques with levels including conversational, simple, and complex speech instruction. SilVar is built upon CLIP, Whisper, and LLaMA 3.1-8B, enabling intuitive interactions by allowing users to provide verbal or text instructions. To this end, we introduce a dataset designed to challenge models with speech-based reasoning tasks for object localization. This dataset enhances the model ability to process and explain visual scenes from spoken input, moving beyond object recognition to reasoning-based interactions. The experiments show that SilVar achieves SOTA performance on the MMMU and ScienceQA benchmarks despite the challenge of speech-based instructions. We believe SilVar will inspire next-generation multimodal reasoning models, toward expert artificial general intelligence. Our code and dataset are available here.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

However, these models often struggle with generating anatomically accurate representations of human hands. The resulting images frequently exhibit issues such as incorrect numbers of fingers, unnatural twisting or interlacing of fingers, or blurred and indistinct hands. These issues stem from the inherent complexity of hand structures and the difficulty in aligning textual descriptions with precise visual depictions of hands. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named Hand1000 that enables the generation of realistic hand images with target gesture using only 1,000 training samples. The training of Hand1000 is divided into three stages with the first stage aiming to enhance the model's understanding of hand anatomy by using a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to extract gesture representation. The second stage further optimizes text embedding by incorporating the extracted hand gesture representation, to improve alignment between the textual descriptions and the generated hand images. The third stage utilizes the optimized embedding to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to generate realistic hand images. In addition, we construct the first publicly available dataset specifically designed for text-to-hand image generation. Based on the existing hand gesture recognition dataset, we adopt advanced image captioning models and LLaMA3 to generate high-quality textual descriptions enriched with detailed gesture information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hand1000 significantly outperforms existing models in producing anatomically correct hand images while faithfully representing other details in the text, such as faces, clothing, and colors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

Self-Instruct provides an annotation-free way for generating instruction data, but its quality is poor, as multimodal alignment remains a hurdle even for the largest models. In this work, we propose LLaVAR-2, to enhance multimodal alignment for text-rich images through hybrid instruction generation between human annotators and large language models. Specifically, it involves detailed image captions from human annotators, followed by the use of these annotations in tailored text prompts for GPT-4o to curate a dataset. It also implements several mechanisms to filter out low-quality data, and the resulting dataset comprises 424k high-quality pairs of instructions. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on this dataset exhibit impressive enhancements over those trained with self-instruct data.</p></details> | COLING 2025 | None |
| **[Reframing Image Difference Captioning with BLIP2IDC and Synthetic Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15939v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of the generative models quality during the past years enabled the generation of edited variations of images at an important scale. To counter the harmful effects of such technology, the Image Difference Captioning (IDC) task aims to describe the differences between two images. While this task is successfully handled for simple 3D rendered images, it struggles on real-world images. The reason is twofold: the training data-scarcity, and the difficulty to capture fine-grained differences between complex images. To address those issues, we propose in this paper a simple yet effective framework to both adapt existing image captioning models to the IDC task and augment IDC datasets. We introduce BLIP2IDC, an adaptation of BLIP2 to the IDC task at low computational cost, and show it outperforms two-streams approaches by a significant margin on real-world IDC datasets. We also propose to use synthetic augmentation to improve the performance of IDC models in an agnostic fashion. We show that our synthetic augmentation strategy provides high quality data, leading to a challenging new dataset well-suited for IDC named Syned1.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[User-Aware Prefix-Tuning is a Good Learner for Personalized Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04793v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning bridges the gap between vision and language by automatically generating natural language descriptions for images. Traditional image captioning methods often overlook the preferences and characteristics of users. Personalized image captioning solves this problem by incorporating user prior knowledge into the model, such as writing styles and preferred vocabularies. Most existing methods emphasize the user context fusion process by memory networks or transformers. However, these methods ignore the distinct domains of each dataset. Therefore, they need to update the entire caption model parameters when meeting new samples, which is time-consuming and calculation-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel personalized image captioning framework that leverages user context to consider personality factors. Additionally, our framework utilizes the prefix-tuning paradigm to extract knowledge from a frozen large language model, reducing the gap between different language domains. Specifically, we employ CLIP to extract the visual features of an image and align the semantic space using a query-guided mapping network. By incorporating the transformer layer, we merge the visual features with the user's contextual prior knowledge to generate informative prefixes. Moreover, we employ GPT-2 as the frozen large language model. With a small number of parameters to be trained, our model performs efficiently and effectively. Our model outperforms existing baseline models on Instagram and YFCC100M datasets across five evaluation metrics, demonstrating its superiority, including twofold improvements in metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Human Data: Aligning Multimodal Large Language Models by Iterative Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15650v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human preference alignment can greatly enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), but collecting high-quality preference data is costly. A promising solution is the self-evolution strategy, where models are iteratively trained on data they generate. However, current techniques still rely on human- or GPT-annotated data and sometimes require additional models or ground truth answers. To address these issues, we propose a novel multimodal self-evolution framework that enables the model to autonomously generate high-quality questions and answers using only unannotated images. First, we implement an image-driven self-questioning mechanism, allowing the model to create and evaluate questions based on image content, regenerating them if they are irrelevant or unanswerable. This sets a strong foundation for answer generation. Second, we introduce an answer self-enhancement technique, starting with image captioning to improve answer quality. We also use corrupted images to generate rejected answers, forming distinct preference pairs for optimization. Finally, we incorporate an image content alignment loss function alongside Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss to reduce hallucinations, ensuring the model focuses on image content. Experiments show that our framework performs competitively with methods using external information, offering a more efficient and scalable approach to MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

We introduce a unique procedure called Mixing Visual Concepts (MVC) where we create novel text embeddings from image captions. The MVC enables us to generate multiple images which are diverse and yet similar to the real data enabling us to perform effective dataset augmentation.

Existing supervised methods depend on datasets containing triplets of input image, edited image, and edit instruction. These are generated by either existing editing methods or human-annotations, which introduce biases and limit their generalization ability. Our method addresses these challenges by introducing a novel editing mechanism called Cycle Edit Consistency (CEC), which applies forward and backward edits in one training step and enforces consistency in image and attention spaces. This allows us to bypass the need for ground-truth edited images and unlock training for the first time on datasets comprising either real image-caption pairs or image-caption-edit triplets. We empirically show that our unsupervised technique performs better across a broader range of edits with high fidelity and precision. By eliminating the need for pre-existing datasets of triplets, reducing biases associated with supervised methods, and proposing CEC, our work represents a significant advancement in unblocking scaling of instruction-based image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://enis.dev/uip2p/</p></details> | None |

VHM is built on a large-scale remote sensing image-text dataset with rich-content captions (VersaD), and an honest instruction dataset comprising both factual and deceptive questions (HnstD). Unlike prevailing remote sensing image-text datasets, in which image captions focus on a few prominent objects and their relationships, VersaD captions provide detailed information about image properties, object attributes, and the overall scene. This comprehensive captioning enables VHM to thoroughly understand remote sensing images and perform diverse remote sensing tasks. Moreover, different from existing remote sensing instruction datasets that only include factual questions, HnstD contains additional deceptive questions stemming from the non-existence of objects. This feature prevents VHM from producing affirmative answers to nonsense queries, thereby ensuring its honesty. In our experiments, VHM significantly outperforms various vision language models on common tasks of scene classification, visual question answering, and visual grounding. Additionally, VHM achieves competent performance on several unexplored tasks, such as building vectorizing, multi-label classification and honest question answering. We will release the code, data and model weights at https://github.com/opendatalab/VHM .</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution: Chao Pang, Xingxing Weng, Jiang Wu; Corresponding author: Gui-Song Xia, Conghui He</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/opendatalab/VHM) |

Here, the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion models, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly, for text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth estimation, and image super-resolution. We hope this paper contributes to accelerating progress in cross-modal media generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cross-flow.github.io/</p></details> | None |

In cross-modal retrieval, many works have focused on retrieving relevant items from natural language queries, while few have explored query suggestion solutions. In this work, we address query suggestion in cross-modal retrieval, introducing a novel task that focuses on suggesting minimal textual modifications needed to explore visually consistent subsets of the collection, following the premise of ''Maybe you are looking for''. To facilitate the evaluation and development of methods, we present a tailored benchmark named CroQS. This dataset comprises initial queries, grouped result sets, and human-defined suggested queries for each group. We establish dedicated metrics to rigorously evaluate the performance of various methods on this task, measuring representativeness, cluster specificity, and similarity of the suggested queries to the original ones. Baseline methods from related fields, such as image captioning and content summarization, are adapted for this task to provide reference performance scores. Although relatively far from human performance, our experiments reveal that both LLM-based and captioning-based methods achieve competitive results on CroQS, improving the recall on cluster specificity by more than 115% and representativeness mAP by more than 52% with respect to the initial query.

These models have opened new avenues for developing unified biomedical assistants capable of analyzing biomedical images, answering complex questions about them, and predicting the impact of medical procedures on a patient's health. However, existing resources face challenges such as limited data availability, narrow domain coverage, and restricted sources (e.g., medical papers).

With 1.47 million instances, MedMax encompasses a diverse range of tasks, including multimodal content generation (interleaved image-text data), biomedical image captioning and generation, visual chatting, and report understanding. These tasks span diverse medical domains such as radiology and histopathology. Subsequently, we fine-tune a mixed-modal foundation model on the MedMax dataset, achieving significant performance improvements: a 26% gain over the Chameleon model and an 18.3% improvement over GPT-4o across 12 downstream biomedical visual question-answering tasks. Additionally, we introduce a unified evaluation suite for biomedical tasks, providing a robust framework to guide the development of next-generation mixed-modal biomedical AI assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 fi...</summary><p>12 figures, 15 tables</p></details> | None |

However, recent studies have revealed that VLMs are vulnerable to image-based adversarial attacks, particularly targeted adversarial images that manipulate the model to generate harmful content specified by the adversary. Current attack methods rely on predefined target labels to create targeted adversarial attacks, which limits their scalability and applicability for large-scale robustness evaluations. In this paper, we propose AnyAttack, a self-supervised framework that generates targeted adversarial images for VLMs without label supervision, allowing any image to serve as a target for the attack. Our framework employs the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, with the adversarial noise generator pre-trained on the large-scale LAION-400M dataset. This large-scale pre-training endows our method with powerful transferability across a wide range of VLMs. Extensive experiments on five mainstream open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) across three multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, multimodal classification, and image captioning) demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. Additionally, we successfully transfer AnyAttack to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini, Claude Sonnet, Microsoft Copilot and OpenAI GPT. These results reveal an unprecedented risk to VLMs, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures.</p></details> |  | None |

However, while these models excel at generating factual content, their ability to generate and evaluate texts reflecting perspectives on the same image, depending on the context, has not been sufficiently explored. To address this, we propose IRR: Image Review Rank, a novel evaluation framework designed to assess critic review texts from multiple perspectives. IRR evaluates LVLMs by measuring how closely their judgments align with human interpretations. We validate it using a dataset of images from 15 categories, each with five critic review texts and annotated rankings in both English and Japanese, totaling over 2,000 data instances. The datasets are available at https://hf.co/datasets/naist-nlp/Wiki-ImageReview1.0. Our results indicate that, although LVLMs exhibited consistent performance across languages, their correlation with human annotations was insufficient, highlighting the need for further advancements. These findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation methods and the need for approaches that better capture human reasoning in Vision & Language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, Accepted at COLING25</p></details> | None |

With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.</p></details> |  | None |

With this different deep-learning techniques are devised for the development of factual and stylized image captioning models. Previous models focused more on the generation of factual and stylized captions separately providing more than one caption for a single image. The descriptions generated from these suffer from out-of-vocabulary and repetition issues. To the best of our knowledge, no such work exists that provided a description that integrates different captioning methods to describe the contents of an image with factual and stylized (romantic and humorous) elements. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel Unified Attention and Multi-Head Attention-driven Caption Summarization Transformer (UnMA-CapSumT) based Captioning Framework. It utilizes both factual captions and stylized captions generated by the Modified Adaptive Attention-based factual image captioning model (MAA-FIC) and Style Factored Bi-LSTM with attention (SF-Bi-ALSTM) driven stylized image captioning model respectively. SF-Bi-ALSTM-based stylized IC model generates two prominent styles of expression- {romance, and humor}. The proposed summarizer UnMHA-ST combines both factual and stylized descriptions of an input image to generate styled rich coherent summarized captions. The proposed UnMHA-ST transformer learns and summarizes different linguistic styles efficiently by incorporating proposed word embedding fastText with Attention Word Embedding (fTA-WE) and pointer-generator network with coverage mechanism concept to solve the out-of-vocabulary issues and repetition problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on Flickr8K and a subset of FlickrStyle10K with supporting ablation studies to prove the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Causal Graphical Models for Vision-Language Compositional Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09353v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a "bag of words". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet concerns persist about their potential to amplify human-like biases, including skin tone bias. Skin tone bias, where darker-skinned individuals face more negative stereotyping than lighter-skinned individuals, is well-documented in the social sciences but remains under-explored in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in VLMs. While well-documented in the social sciences, this bias remains under-explored in AI, particularly in VLMs. Using the GAN Face Database, we sampled computer-generated images of Black American men and women, controlling for skin tone variations while keeping other features constant. We then asked VLMs to write stories about these faces and compared the homogeneity of the generated stories. Stories generated by VLMs about darker-skinned Black individuals were more homogeneous than those about lighter-skinned individuals in three of four models, and Black women were consistently represented more homogeneously than Black men across all models. Interaction effects revealed a greater impact of skin tone on women in two VLMs, while the other two showed nonsignificant results, reflecting known stereotyping patterns. These findings underscore the propagation of biases from single-modality AI systems to multimodal models and highlight the need for further research to address intersectional biases in AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AICAttack: Adversarial Image Captioning Attack with Attention-Based Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11940v4)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning research have shown remarkable achievements across many tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). At the intersection of CV and NLP is the problem of image captioning, where the related models' robustness against adversarial attacks has not been well studied. This paper presents a novel adversarial attack strategy, AICAttack (Attention-based Image Captioning Attack), designed to attack image captioning models through subtle perturbations on images. Operating within a black-box attack scenario, our algorithm requires no access to the target model's architecture, parameters, or gradient information. We introduce an attention-based candidate selection mechanism that identifies the optimal pixels to attack, followed by a customised differential evolution method to optimise the perturbations of pixels' RGB values. We demonstrate AICAttack's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets against multiple victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current leading-edge techniques by achieving consistently higher attack success rates.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Seeing Syntax: Uncovering Syntactic Learning Limitations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08111v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs), serve as foundation models for multi-modal applications such as image captioning and text-to-image generation. Recent studies have highlighted limitations in VLM text encoders, particularly in areas like compositionality and semantic understanding, though the underlying reasons for these limitations remain unclear. In this work, we aim to address this gap by analyzing the syntactic information, one of the fundamental linguistic properties, encoded by the text encoders of VLMs. We perform a thorough analysis comparing VLMs with different objective functions, parameter size and training data size, and with uni-modal language models (ULMs) in their ability to encode syntactic knowledge. Our findings suggest that ULM text encoders acquire syntactic information more effectively than those in VLMs. The syntactic information learned by VLM text encoders is shaped primarily by the pre-training objective, which plays a more crucial role than other factors such as model architecture, model size, or the volume of pre-training data. Models exhibit different layer-wise trends where CLIP performance dropped across layers while for other models, middle layers are rich in encoding syntactic knowledge.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Spatial Understanding in MLLMs: Disambiguation and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06613v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in tasks such as image captioning and question answering. However, while these models can generate realistic captions, they often struggle with providing precise instructions, particularly when it comes to localizing and disambiguating objects in complex 3D environments. This capability is critical as MLLMs become more integrated with collaborative robotic systems. In scenarios where a target object is surrounded by similar objects (distractors), robots must deliver clear, spatially-aware instructions to guide humans effectively. We refer to this challenge as contextual object localization and disambiguation, which imposes stricter constraints than conventional 3D dense captioning, especially regarding ensuring target exclusivity. In response, we propose simple yet effective techniques to enhance the model's ability to localize and disambiguate target objects. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional metrics that evaluate sentence similarity, but also demonstrates improved 3D spatial understanding through 3D visual grounding model.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records (EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and innovative approaches to synthesis. This work also provides a foundation for future research in the application of LLMs in medicine, contributing to the evolving field of medical artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 tables | None |

We hypothesize that integrating fine-grained concept annotations (e.g., object labels and object regions) will further improve performance, as both data granularities complement each other in terms of breadth and depth in concept representation. We introduce a new dataset featuring Multimodal Multi-Grained Concept annotations (MMGiC) for MLLMs. In constructing MMGiC, we explore the impact of different data recipes on multimodal comprehension and generation. Our analyses reveal that multi-grained concept annotations integrate and complement each other, under our structured template and a general MLLM framework. We clearly explore and demonstrate the potential of MMGiC to help MLLMs better locate and learn concepts, aligning vision and language at multiple granularities. We further validate our hypothesis by investigating the fair comparison and effective collaboration between MMGiC and image--caption data on 12 multimodal comprehension and generation benchmarks, e.g., their appropriate combination achieve 3.95% and 2.34% absolute improvements over image--caption data alone on POPE and SEED-Bench.

| **[HMGIE: Hierarchical and Multi-Grained Inconsistency Evaluation for Vision-Language Data Cleansing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05685v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-textual inconsistency (VTI) evaluation plays a crucial role in cleansing vision-language data. Its main challenges stem from the high variety of image captioning datasets, where differences in content can create a range of inconsistencies (\eg, inconsistencies in scene, entities, entity attributes, entity numbers, entity interactions). Moreover, variations in caption length can introduce inconsistencies at different levels of granularity as well. To tackle these challenges, we design an adaptive evaluation framework, called Hierarchical and Multi-Grained Inconsistency Evaluation (HMGIE), which can provide multi-grained evaluations covering both accuracy and completeness for various image-caption pairs. Specifically, the HMGIE framework is implemented by three consecutive modules. Firstly, the semantic graph generation module converts the image caption to a semantic graph for building a structural representation of all involved semantic items. Then, the hierarchical inconsistency evaluation module provides a progressive evaluation procedure with a dynamic question-answer generation and evaluation strategy guided by the semantic graph, producing a hierarchical inconsistency evaluation graph (HIEG). Finally, the quantitative evaluation module calculates the accuracy and completeness scores based on the HIEG, followed by a natural language explanation about the detection results. Moreover, to verify the efficacy and flexibility of the proposed framework on handling different image captioning datasets, we construct MVTID, an image-caption dataset with diverse types and granularities of inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on MVTID and other benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed HMGIE to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CompCap: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Composite Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05243v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How well can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand composite images? Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision transformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different levels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted to diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and an innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual features into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we propose "depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)" to fuse the visual features extracted from different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is composed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of the projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse open-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and instruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of Florence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders on vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play important roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks covering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart, knowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our models and the complete training recipe are open-sourced. https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL) |

The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed VLMs into open ones. As a result, the community has been missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. We present Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. Our key contribution is a collection of new datasets called PixMo, including a dataset of highly detailed image captions for pre-training, a free-form image Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, and an innovative 2D pointing dataset, all collected without the use of external VLMs. The success of our approach relies on careful modeling choices, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets. Our best-in-class 72B model not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models, but also outperforms larger proprietary models including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash, second only to GPT-4o based on both academic benchmarks and on a large human evaluation.

In this work, we apply these captioning techniques to generate clinician-like interpretations of ECG data. This study leverages existing ECG datasets accompanied by free-text reports authored by healthcare professionals (HCPs) as training data. These reports, while often inconsistent, provide a valuable foundation for automated learning. We introduce an encoder-decoder-based method that uses these reports to train models to generate detailed descriptions of ECG episodes. This represents a significant advancement in ECG analysis automation, with potential applications in zero-shot classification and automated clinical decision support. The model is tested on various datasets, including both 1- and 12-lead ECGs. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art reference model by Qiu et al., achieving a METEOR score of 55.53% compared to 24.51% achieved by the reference model. Furthermore, several key design choices are discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of current challenges and innovations in this domain.

Recent advancements have seen a convergence between image captioning research and the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs -- like GPT-4V and Gemini -- which extend the capabilities of text-only LLMs to multiple modalities. This paper investigates whether Multimodal LLMs can supplant traditional image captioning networks by evaluating their performance on various image description benchmarks. We explore both the zero-shot capabilities of these models and their adaptability to different semantic domains through fine-tuning methods, including prompt learning, prefix tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Our results demonstrate that while Multimodal LLMs achieve impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning for specific domains while maintaining their generalization capabilities intact remains challenging. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research in image captioning and the development of more adaptable Multimodal LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 Workshop on Green Foundation Models</p></details> | None |

While broad, their knowledge remains generic (e.g., recognizing a dog), and they are unable to handle personalized subjects (e.g., recognizing a user's pet dog). Human reasoning, in contrast, typically operates within the context of specific subjects in our surroundings. For example, one might ask, "What should I buy for my dog's birthday?"; as opposed to a generic inquiry about "What should I buy for a dog's birthday?". Similarly, when looking at a friend's image, the interest lies in seeing their activities (e.g., "my friend is holding a cat"), rather than merely observing generic human actions (e.g., "a man is holding a cat"). In this paper, we introduce the novel task of personalizing LMMs, so that they can have conversations about a specific subject. We propose Yo'LLaVA, which learns to embed a personalized subject into a set of latent tokens given a handful of example images of the subject. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that Yo'LLaVA can learn the concept more efficiently using fewer tokens and more effectively encode the visual attributes compared to strong prompting baselines (e.g., LLaVA).</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024; Project page: https://thaoshibe.github.io/YoLLaVA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://thaoshibe.github.io/YoLLaVA) |

Among these advances, the task of editing an image on the basis solely of a natural language instruction stands out as a most challenging endeavour. While recent approaches for this task resort, in one way or other, to some form of preliminary preparation, training or fine-tuning, this paper explores a novel approach: We propose a preparation-free method that permits instruction-guided image editing on the fly. This approach is organized along three steps properly orchestrated that resort to image captioning and DDIM inversion, followed by obtaining the edit direction embedding, followed by image editing proper. While dispensing with preliminary preparation, our approach demonstrates to be effective and competitive, outperforming recent, state of the art models for this task when evaluated on the MAGICBRUSH dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Various SLMs and VLMs belonging to the Qwen and LLaMA architecture family are chosen and variants based on model size in terms of the number of parameters, quantization level and fine-tuning parameters are evaluated. The model variant's performance and carbon emissions are calculated. To quantify the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions, we introduce a novel metric called CEGI (Carbon Efficient Gain Index). This metric represents the carbon emission per unit percentage gain per million trainable parameters . This metric provides a normalized measure to compare model's efficiency in terms of performance improvement relative to their environmental cost. The experiment's outcome demonstrates that fine-tuning SLMs and VLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to Large Language Models (LLMs) while producing significantly less carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the marginal gains in accuracy from larger models do not justify the substantial increase in carbon emissions. Leveraging lower-bit quantization levels, the proposed metric further enhances energy efficiency without compromising performance. This study highlights balancing high performance and environmental sustainability. It offers a valuable metric for selecting models suitable for environmentally-friendly AI development.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Multi-modal Large Language Models via Visual Token Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17773v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability to perceive data formats beyond text, significantly advancing a range of downstream applications, such as visual question answering and image captioning. However, the substantial computational costs associated with processing high-resolution images and videos pose a barrier to their broader adoption. To address this challenge, compressing vision tokens in MLLMs has emerged as a promising approach to reduce inference costs. While existing methods conduct token reduction in the feature alignment phase. In this paper, we introduce VisToG, a novel grouping mechanism that leverages the capabilities of pre-trained vision encoders to group similar image segments without the need for segmentation masks. Specifically, we concatenate semantic tokens to represent image semantic segments after the linear projection layer before feeding into the vision encoder. Besides, with the isolated attention we adopt, VisToG can identify and eliminate redundant visual tokens utilizing the prior knowledge in the pre-trained vision encoder, which effectively reduces computational demands. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VisToG, maintaining 98.1% of the original performance while achieving a reduction of over 27\% inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

In light of the recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4v and LLaVA, which demonstrate their exceptional proficiency in multimodal tasks, such as image captioning and multimodal question answering. We introduce a novel federated learning framework, named Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning (MLLM-LLaVA-FL), which employs powerful MLLMs at the server end to address the heterogeneous and long-tailed challenges. Owing to the advanced cross-modality representation capabilities and the extensive open-vocabulary prior knowledge of MLLMs, our framework is adept at harnessing the extensive, yet previously underexploited, open-source data accessible from websites and powerful server-side computational resources. Hence, the MLLM-LLaVA-FL not only enhances the performance but also avoids increasing the risk of privacy leakage and the computational burden on local devices, distinguishing it from prior methodologies. Our framework has three key stages. Initially, we conduct global visual-text pretraining of the model. This pretraining is facilitated by utilizing the extensive open-source data available online, with the assistance of MLLMs. Subsequently, the pretrained model is distributed among various clients for local training. Finally, once the locally trained models are transmitted back to the server, a global alignment is carried out under the supervision of MLLMs to further enhance the performance. Experimental evaluations on established benchmarks, show that our framework delivers promising performance in the typical scenarios with data heterogeneity and long-tail distribution across different clients in FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

To enhance generalization in out-of-domain scenarios, retrieval-augmented approaches have garnered increasing attention. However, current methods face two key challenges: (1) image features used for retrieval are often optimized based on ground-truth (GT) captions, which represent the image from a specific perspective and are influenced by annotator biases, and (2) they underutilize the full potential of retrieved text, typically relying on raw captions or parsed objects, which fail to capture the full semantic richness of the data. In this paper, we propose Dive Into Retrieval (DIR), a method designed to enhance both the image-to-text retrieval process and the utilization of retrieved text to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the visual content. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) diffusion-guided retrieval enhancement, where a pretrained diffusion model guides image feature learning by reconstructing noisy images, allowing the model to capture more comprehensive and fine-grained visual information beyond standard annotated captions; and (2) a high-quality retrieval database, which provides comprehensive semantic information to enhance caption generation, especially in out-of-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIR not only maintains competitive in-domain performance but also significantly improves out-of-domain generalization, all without increasing inference costs.</p></details> |  | None |
