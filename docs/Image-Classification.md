| **[Measuring the Effect of Background on Classification and Feature Importance in Deep Learning for AV Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05937v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Common approaches to explainable AI (XAI) for deep learning focus on analyzing the importance of input features on the classification task in a given model: saliency methods like SHAP and GradCAM are used to measure the impact of spatial regions of the input image on the classification result. Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].

| **[Open-PMC-18M: A High-Fidelity Large Scale Medical Dataset for Multimodal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02738v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In biomedical vision-language modeling, datasets are typically mined from scientific literature, pairing compound figures with captions that are short, context-dependent, and oftern partially informative. Prior work on subfigure extraction has been limited in both dataset size and generalizability. In addition, no existing effort has incorporated rich medical context in image-text pairs. We revisit data curation as a foundational component of effective biomedical representation learning. Our data curation process integrates transformer-based subfigure detection, subcaption extraction, and contextual text enrichment derived from inline references. Our subfigure extraction model, trained on a corpus of 500,000 compound figures, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real and synthetic benchmarks. Using this process, we curate and release Open-PMC-18M, a large-scale high-fidelity biomedical dataset comprising 18 million image-text pairs, spanning radiology, microscopy, and visible light photography. We train vision-language models on our dataset and perform extensive evaluation on 6 retrieval and 19 zero-shot classification tasks across three major modalities. The models trained on our dataset set a new state-of-the-art results in medical representation learning. We release our dataset, models, and code to support reproducible benchmarks and further study into biomedical vision-language modeling and representation learning.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |
| **[Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07413v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization. To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space. Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation strategies.

| **[SAGE: Saliency-Guided Contrastive Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12744v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating human perceptual priors into the training of neural networks has been shown to raise model generalization, serve as an effective regularizer, and align models with human expertise for applications in high-risk domains. Existing approaches to integrate saliency into model training often rely on internal model mechanisms, which recent research suggests may be unreliable. Our insight is that many challenges associated with saliency-guided training stem from the placement of the guidance approaches solely within the image space. Instead, we move away from the image space, use the model's latent space embeddings to steer human guidance during training, and we propose SAGE (Saliency-Guided Contrastive Embeddings): a loss function that integrates human saliency into network training using contrastive embeddings. We apply salient-preserving and saliency-degrading signal augmentations to the input and capture the changes in embeddings and model logits. We guide the model towards salient features and away from non-salient features using a contrastive triplet loss. Additionally, we perform a sanity check on the logit distributions to ensure that the model outputs match the saliency-based augmentations. We demonstrate a boost in classification performance across both open- and closed-set scenarios against SOTA saliency-based methods, showing SAGE's effectiveness across various backbones, and include experiments to suggest its wide generalization across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Phase-OTDR Event Detection Using Image-Based Data Transformation and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05830v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study focuses on event detection in optical fibers, specifically classifying six events using the Phase-OTDR system. A novel approach is introduced to enhance Phase-OTDR data analysis by transforming 1D data into grayscale images through techniques such as Gramian Angular Difference Field, Gramian Angular Summation Field, and Recurrence Plot. These grayscale images are combined into a multi-channel RGB representation, enabling more robust and adaptable analysis using transfer learning models. The proposed methodology achieves high classification accuracies of 98.84% and 98.24% with the EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121 models, respectively. A 5-fold cross-validation process confirms the reliability of these models, with test accuracy rates of 99.07% and 98.68%. Using a publicly available Phase-OTDR dataset, the study demonstrates an efficient approach to understanding optical fiber events while reducing dataset size and improving analysis efficiency. The results highlight the transformative potential of image-based analysis in interpreting complex fiber optic sensing data, offering significant advancements in the accuracy and reliability of fiber optic monitoring systems. The codes and the corresponding image-based dataset are made publicly available on GitHub to support further research: https://github.com/miralab-ai/Phase-OTDR-event-detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/miralab-ai/Phase-OTDR-event-detection) |
| **[UG-FedDA: Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation for Multi-Center Alzheimer's Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05814v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, and early diagnosis is critical for timely intervention. However, most existing classification frameworks face challenges in multicenter studies, as they often neglect inter-site heterogeneity and lack mechanisms to quantify uncertainty, which limits their robustness and clinical applicability. To address these issues, we proposed Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation (UG-FedDA), a novel multicenter AD classification framework that integrates uncertainty quantification (UQ) with federated domain adaptation to handle cross-site structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) heterogeneity under privacy constraints. Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions. UQ is integrated to guide feature alignment, mitigating source-target distribution shifts by down-weighting uncertain samples. Experiments are conducted on three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). UG-FedDA achieved consistent cross-domain improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve across three classification tasks: AD vs. normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI. For NC vs. AD, UG-FedDA achieves accuracies of 90.54%, 89.04%, and 77.78% on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS datasets, respectively. For MCI vs. AD, accuracies are 80.20% (ADNI), 71.91% (AIBL), and 79.73% (OASIS). For NC vs. MCI, results are 76.87% (ADNI), 73.91% (AIBL), and 83.73% (OASIS). These results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only adapts efficiently across multiple sites but also preserves strict privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is already available on GitHub: https://github.com/chenzhao2023/UG_FADDA_AlzhemiersClassification</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/chenzhao2023/UG_FADDA_AlzhemiersClassification) |
| **[ZQBA: Zero Query Black-box Adversarial Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00769v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world contexts.

| **[From Correlation to Causation: Max-Pooling-Based Multi-Instance Learning Leads to More Robust Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09449v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In whole slide images (WSIs) analysis, attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) models are susceptible to spurious correlations and degrade under domain shift. These methods may assign high attention weights to non-tumor regions, such as staining biases or artifacts, leading to unreliable tumor region localization. In this paper, we revisit max-pooling-based MIL methods from a causal perspective. Under mild assumptions, our theoretical results demonstrate that max-pooling encourages the model to focus on causal factors while ignoring bias-related factors. Furthermore, we discover that existing max-pooling-based methods may overfit the training set through rote memorization of instance features and fail to learn meaningful patterns. To address these issues, we propose FocusMIL, which couples max-pooling with an instance-level variational information bottleneck (VIB) to learn compact, predictive latent representations, and employs a multi-bag mini-batch scheme to stabilize optimization. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets and one semi-synthetic dataset. The results show that, by capturing causal factors, FocusMIL exhibits significant advantages in out-of-distribution scenarios and instance-level tumor region localization tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Finding Phones Fast: Low-Latency and Scalable Monitoring of Cellular Communications in Sensitive Areas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25430v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread availability of cellular devices introduces new threat vectors that allow users or attackers to bypass security policies and physical barriers and bring unauthorized devices into sensitive areas. We identify a critical gap in this context: the absence of low-latency systems for high-quality and instantaneous monitoring of cellular transmissions. Such low-latency systems are crucial to allow for timely detection, decision, and disruption of unauthorized communication in sensitive areas. Operator-based monitoring systems, built for purposes such as people counting or tracking, lack real-time capability, require cooperation across multiple operators, and thus are hard to deploy. Operator-independent monitoring approaches proposed in the literature either lack low-latency capabilities or do not scale. We propose WaveTag, the first low-latency and scalable system designed to monitor 5G and LTE connections across all operators prior to any user data transmission. WaveTag consists of several downlink sniffers and a distributed network of uplink sniffers that measure both downlink protocol information and uplink signal characteristics at multiple locations to gain a detailed spatial image of uplink signals. WaveTag then aggregates the recorded information, processes it, and provides a decision about the connection--all done prior to the complete connection establishment of a UE. To evaluate WaveTag, we deployed it in the context of geofencing, where WaveTag was able to determine whether the signals originate from inside or outside of an area within 2.3 ms of the initial base station-to-device message, therefore enabling prompt and targeted suppression of communication before any user data was transmitted. WaveTag achieved 99.66% geofencing classification accuracy. Finally, we conduct a real-world uplink measurement evaluation on a commercial 5G SA network.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NormalView: sensor-agnostic tree species classification from backpack and aerial lidar data using geometric projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05610v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Laser scanning has proven to be an invaluable tool in assessing the decomposition of forest environments. Mobile laser scanning (MLS) has shown to be highly promising for extremely accurate, tree level inventory. In this study, we present NormalView, a sensor-agnostic projection-based deep learning method for classifying tree species from point cloud data. NormalView embeds local geometric information into two-dimensional projections, in the form of normal vector estimates, and uses the projections as inputs to an image classification network, YOLOv11. In addition, we inspected the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance. We trained and tested our model on high-density MLS data (7 species, ~5000 pts/m^2), as well as high-density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (9 species, >1000 pts/m^2). On the MLS data, NormalView achieves an overall accuracy (macro-average accuracy) of 95.5 % (94.8 %), and 91.8 % (79.1 %) on the ALS data. We found that having intensity information from multiple scanners provides benefits in tree species classification, and the best model on the multispectral ALS dataset was a model using intensity information from all three channels of the multispectral ALS. This study demonstrates that projection-based methods, when enhanced with geometric information and coupled with state-of-the-art image classification backbones, can achieve exceptional results. Crucially, these methods are sensor-agnostic, relying only on geometric information. Additionally, we publically release the MLS dataset used in the study.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Wasserstein distance based semi-supervised manifold learning and application to GNSS multi-path detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05567v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main objective of this study is to propose an optimal transport based semi-supervised approach to learn from scarce labelled image data using deep convolutional networks. The principle lies in implicit graph-based transductive semi-supervised learning where the similarity metric between image samples is the Wasserstein distance. This metric is used in the label propagation mechanism during learning. We apply and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a GNSS real life application. More specifically, we address the problem of multi-path interference detection. Experiments are conducted under various signal conditions. The results show that for specific choices of hyperparameters controlling the amount of semi-supervision and the level of sensitivity to the metric, the classification accuracy can be significantly improved over the fully supervised training method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Moving object detection from multi-depth images with an attention-enhanced CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05415v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the greatest challenges for detecting moving objects in the solar system from wide-field survey data is determining whether a signal indicates a true object or is due to some other source, like noise. Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 22 figures, submitted to PASJ</p></details> | None |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Conformal Prediction Under Local Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15721v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction (CP) provides sets of candidate classes with a guaranteed probability of containing the true class. However, it typically relies on a calibration set with clean labels. We address privacy-sensitive scenarios where the aggregator is untrusted and can only access a perturbed version of the true labels. We propose two complementary approaches under local differential privacy (LDP). In the first approach, users do not access the model but instead provide their input features and a perturbed label using a k-ary randomized response. In the second approach, which enforces stricter privacy constraints, users add noise to their conformity score by binary search response. This method requires access to the classification model but preserves both data and label privacy. Both approaches compute the conformal threshold directly from noisy data without accessing the true labels. We prove finite-sample coverage guarantees and demonstrate robust coverage even under severe randomization. This approach unifies strong local privacy with predictive uncertainty control, making it well-suited for sensitive applications such as medical imaging or large language model queries, regardless of whether users can (or are willing to) compute their own scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COPA 2025.

| **[Language Integration in Fine-Tuning Multimodal Large Language Models for Image-Based Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14997v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts (e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating behavior. \textbf{Our analysis reveals that these approaches provide no benefit over image-only training}. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic understanding from textual input. We propose \textbf{Regression via Transformer-Based Classification} (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only images. \textbf{More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts dramatically improve performance}. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to prompts substantially improves our already state-of-the-art image-only baseline. We demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information, surpassing mere statistical biases. We validate RvTC across two different MLLM architectures, demonstrating consistent improvements and method generalizability.</p></details> | WACV 2026 | None |
| **[Balanced Few-Shot Episodic Learning for Accurate Retinal Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04967v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GeoPE:A Unified Geometric Positional Embedding for Structured Tensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04963v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard Vision Transformers flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, disrupting the natural spatial topology. While Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D, it inherits this limitation, often treating spatially distant patches (e.g., at row edges) as sequence neighbors. Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that GeoPE consistently outperforms existing 2D RoPE variants and significantly enhances shape bias, confirming its ability to capture true geometric structure.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[You Only Train Once (YOTO): A Retraining-Free Object Detection Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04888v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection constitutes the primary task within the domain of computer vision. It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in the Elsevier Engineering Journal</p></details> | None |
| **[Multimodal Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models by Leveraging One-To-Many Relationships](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770v5)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. This work pioneers defense strategies against multimodal attacks, providing insights for building robust VLMs from both optimization and data perspectives.

ImageNot is designed to test the external validity of deep learning progress on ImageNet. We show that key model architectures developed for ImageNet over the years rank identically to how they rank on ImageNet when trained from scratch and evaluated on ImageNot. Moreover, the relative improvements of each model over earlier models strongly correlate in both datasets. Our work demonstrates a surprising degree of external validity in the relative performance of image classification models when trained and evaluated on an entirely different dataset. This stands in contrast with absolute accuracy numbers that typically drop sharply even under small changes to a dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

In mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, misclassifying a harmful compound as benign can trigger substantial scientific, regulatory, and health risks, whereas false alarms primarily increase laboratory workload. Modern representations transform molecular graphs into persistence image tensors that preserve multiscale geometric and topological structure, yet existing tensor classifiers and deep tensor neural networks provide no finite-sample guarantees on type I error and often exhibit severe error inflation in practice. We develop the first Tensor Neyman-Pearson (Tensor-NP) classification framework that achieves finite-sample control of type I error while exploiting the multi-mode structure of tensor data. Under a tensor-normal mixture model, we derive the oracle NP discriminant, characterize its Tucker low-rank manifold geometry, and establish tensor-specific margin and conditional detection conditions enabling high-probability bounds on excess type II error. We further propose a Discriminant Tensor Iterative Projection estimator and a Tensor-NP Neural Classifier combining deep learning with Tensor-NP umbrella calibration, yielding the first distribution-free NP-valid methods for multiway data. Across four biochemical datasets, Tensor-NP classifiers maintain type I errors at prespecified levels while delivering competitive type II error performance, providing reliable tools for asymmetric-risk decisions with complex molecular tensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 pa...</summary><p>59 pages, 5 figures and 12 tables (including Supplementary Material)</p></details> | None |
| **[Enabling Fast and Accurate Neutral Atom Readout through Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25982v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of thousands or more qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout. Parallel measurement of qubit arrays currently takes milliseconds, much longer than the underlying quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement, long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution. Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but unreliable readout. We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework, GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Performance Evaluation of Transfer Learning Based Medical Image Classification Techniques for Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04397v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image classification plays an increasingly vital role in identifying various diseases by classifying medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs and CT scans, into different categories based on their features. In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements.</p></details> |  | None |

This addresses a critical and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3 synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to 38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data characterization and fine-grained data selection.</p></details> | Under review | None |

While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous work in quantization lack two important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Group Actions In Disentangled Latent Image Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04015v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling group actions on latent representations enables controllable transformations of high-dimensional image data. Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/farhanaswarnali/Learning-Group-Actions-In-Disentangled-Latent-Image-Representations .</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/farhanaswarnali/Learning-Group-Actions-In-Disentangled-Latent-Image-Representations) |
| **[Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12917v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth) models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We show that RevDEQs significantly improve performance on language modelling and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.</p></details> |  | None |

No existing framework unifies these objectives within a single architecture while retaining generalization across imaging modalities and datasets. We introduce PULSE, a multi-task vision-language framework built on self-supervised representations and optimized through a composite supervision strategy that balances region overlap learning, pixel wise classification fidelity, and boundary aware IoU refinement. A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture. Unlike prior task-specific pipelines, PULSE learns task-invariant cardiac priors, generalizes robustly across datasets, and can be adapted to new imaging modalities with minimal supervision. This moves the field closer to a scalable, foundation style cardiac analysis framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Translating these glyphs into English poses various challenges, including the fact that a single glyph can have multiple meanings. Deep learning translation applications are evolving rapidly, producing remarkable results that significantly impact our lives. In this research, we propose a method for the automatic recognition and translation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs from images to English. This study utilized two datasets for classification and translation: the Morris Franken dataset and the EgyptianTranslation dataset. Our approach is divided into three stages: segmentation (using Contour and Detectron2), mapping symbols to Gardiner codes, and translation (using the CNN model). The model achieved a BLEU score of 42.2, a significant result compared to previous research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Research on Brain Tumor Classification Method Based on Improved ResNet34 Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03751v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previously, image interpretation in radiology relied heavily on manual methods. However, manual classification of brain tumor medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Even with shallow convolutional neural network models, the accuracy is not ideal. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor image classification, this paper proposes a brain tumor classification model based on an improved ResNet34 network. This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model. Therefore, the improved network model not only improves accuracy but also reduces clutter, achieving a classification effect with fewer parameters and higher accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Scale Visual Prompting for Lightweight Small-Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03663v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prompting has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to adapt vision models using lightweight, learnable parameters injected into the input space. However, prior work mainly targets large Vision Transformers and high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. In contrast, small-image benchmarks like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 remain widely used in education, prototyping, and research, yet have received little attention in the context of prompting. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)}, a simple and generic module that learns a set of global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps fused with the input image via a lightweight $1 \times 1$ convolution. MSVP is backbone-agnostic, adds less than $0.02\%$ parameters, and significantly improves performance across CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. We provide a unified benchmark on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using a simple CNN, ResNet-18, and a small Vision Transformer. Our method yields consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. We further include ablations on prompt scales, fusion strategies, and backbone architectures, along with qualitative analyzes using prompt visualizations and Grad-CAM. Our results demonstrate that multi-scale prompting provides an effective inductive bias even on low-resolution images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Class conditional conformal prediction for multiple inputs by p-value aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07150v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through user-submitted images.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing detection methods rely on complex and poorly interpretable architectures, which compromise interpretability and generalization. To address this, we propose FeatureLens, a lightweight framework that acts as a lens to scrutinize anomalies in image features. Comprising an Image Feature Extractor (IFE) and shallow classifiers (e.g., SVM, MLP, or XGBoost) with model sizes ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 parameters, FeatureLens achieves high detection accuracy ranging from 97.8% to 99.75% in closed-set evaluation and 86.17% to 99.6% in generalization evaluation across FGSM, PGD, CW, and DAmageNet attacks, using only 51 dimensional features. By combining strong detection performance with excellent generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency, FeatureLens offers a practical pathway toward transparent and effective adversarial defense.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this problem faces three key challenges: (1) most AIGC detectors produce only a global real-or-fake label without indicating where edits occur; (2) traditional computer vision methods for edit localization typically rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3) there is no large-scale, modern benchmark specifically targeting edited-image detection. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation pipeline and construct FragFake, a large-scale benchmark of AI-edited images spanning multiple source datasets, diverse editing models, and several common edit types. Building on FragFake, we are the first to systematically study vision language models (VLMs) for edited-image classification and edited-region localization. Our experiments show that pretrained VLMs, including GPT4o, perform poorly on this task, whereas fine-tuned models such as Qwen2.5-VL achieve high accuracy and substantially higher object precision across all settings. We further explore GRPO-based RLVR training, which yields modest metric gains while improving the interpretability of model outputs. Ablation and transfer analyses reveal how data balancing, training size, LoRA rank, and training domain affect performance, and highlight both the potential and the limitations of cross-editor and cross-dataset generalization. We anticipate that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.</p></details> | 14pages,19 figures | None |

Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, detailed appendix.

However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across eight datasets.

We present a label-efficient framework that leverages spatial features from a frozen diffusion model pretrained on natural images. Our approach extracts low-level representations from high-resolution decoder layers at early denoising timesteps, which transfer effectively to the low-texture structure of HSI. To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion. Overall, our results indicate that pretrained diffusion models can support domain-agnostic, label-efficient representation learning for remote sensing and broader scientific imaging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ICML 2025 TerraBytes Workshop (June 9, 2025)</p></details> | None |

Self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, there are unique problems in pathology, such as annotated data scarcity, privacy regulations in data sharing, and inherently generative tasks like virtual staining. Generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address these problems through image synthesis. We introduce PixCell, the first generative foundation model for histopathology images. PixCell is a diffusion model trained on PanCan-30M, a large, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H&E-stained whole slide images of various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any human-annotated data. By conditioning on real slides, the synthetic images capture the properties of the real data and can be used as data augmentation for small-scale datasets to boost classification performance. We prove the foundational versatility of PixCell by applying it to two generative downstream tasks: privacy-preserving synthetic data generation and virtual IHC staining. PixCell's high-fidelity conditional generation enables institutions to use their private data to synthesize highly realistic, site-specific surrogate images that can be shared in place of raw patient data. Furthermore, using datasets of roughly paired H&E-IHC tiles, we learn to translate PixCell's conditioning from H&E to multiple IHC stains, allowing the generation of IHC images from H&E inputs. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page - https://histodiffusion.github.io/docs/projects/pixcell</p></details> | [Code Link](https://histodiffusion.github.io/docs) |

However, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial and positional reasoning. ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

In airborne and spaceborne missions, real-time algorithms must distinguish between no fire, active fire, and post-fire conditions, and estimate fire intensity. Multispectral and hyperspectral thermal imagers provide rich spectral information, but high data dimensionality and limited onboard resources make real-time processing challenging. As wildfires increase in frequency and severity, the need for low-latency and computationally efficient onboard detection methods is critical. We present a systematic evaluation of multiple deep learning architectures, including custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, for multi-class fire classification. We also introduce PyroFocus, a two-stage pipeline that performs fire classification followed by fire radiative power (FRP) regression or segmentation to reduce inference time and computational cost for onboard deployment. Using data from NASA's MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), which is similar to a next-generation fire detection sensor, we compare accuracy, inference latency, and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage pipeline achieves strong trade-offs between speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for real-time edge deployment in future wildfire monitoring missions.</p></details> |  | None |

We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |

However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach, achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up, which has been trained directly on them.

All models tackle the same five class classification task using a common dataset of speech recordings. We investigate: (1) a ViT-OF method leveraging a Vision Transformer on spectrogram images, (2) a 1D-CNN approach using eight 1-D CNN's with majority-vote fusion, (3) a BiLSTM-OF approach using nine BiLSTM models with majority vote fusion, and (4) a Hierarchical XGBoost ensemble that combines glottal and formant features through a two stage learning framework. Each method is described, and their performances on a validation set of 53 speakers are compared. Results show that while the feature-engineered XGBoost ensemble achieves the highest macro-F1 (0.86), the deep learning models (ViT, CNN, BiLSTM) attain competitive F1-scores (0.70) and offer complementary insights into the problem.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[On the Problem of Consistent Anomalies in Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02520v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design. We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects. We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies. Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples. Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.</p></details> | PhD Dissertation | None |
| **[MaxSup: Overcoming Representation Collapse in Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15798v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Foundation Models for the Brain and Body</p></details> | None |

Our model incorporates a Volterra-like expansion of the convolution operator, capturing multiplicative interactions akin to those observed in early and advanced stages of biological visual processing. We evaluated this approach on synthetic datasets by measuring sensitivity to testing higher-order correlations and performance in standard benchmarks (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Imagenette). Our architecture outperforms traditional CNN baselines, and achieves optimal performance with expansions up to 3rd/4th order, aligning remarkably well with the distribution of pixel intensities in natural images. Through systematic perturbation analysis, we validate this alignment by isolating the contributions of specific image statistics to model performance, demonstrating how different orders of convolution process distinct aspects of visual information. Furthermore, Representational Similarity Analysis reveals distinct geometries across network layers, indicating qualitatively different modes of visual information processing. Our work bridges neuroscience and deep learning, offering a path towards more effective, biologically inspired computer vision models. It provides insights into visual information processing and lays the groundwork for neural networks that better capture complex visual patterns, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these datasets are inherently heterogeneous, stemming from diverse sensors, geographical regions, acquisition times, and atmospheric conditions. Distribution shifts between training and deployment domains severely limit the generalization of pretrained remote sensing models, making unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) crucial for real-world applications. We introduce FlowEO, a novel framework that leverages generative models for image-space UDA in Earth observation. We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowEO outperforms existing image translation approaches for domain adaptation while achieving on-par or better perceptual image quality, highlighting the potential of flow-matching-based UDA for remote sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>2026 ...</summary><p>2026 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Mar 2026, Tucson (AZ), United States</p></details> | None |

The challenge is that in these complex environments, the anomalies are sometimes highly contextual and also ambiguous, and thereby, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial capacity for an MLLM-based VAD system to succeed. In this paper, we introduce our UQ-supported MLLM-based VAD framework called ALARM. ALARM integrates UQ with quality-assurance techniques like reasoning chain, self-reflection, and MLLM ensemble for robust and accurate performance and is designed based on a rigorous probabilistic inference pipeline and computational process. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted using the real-world smart-home benchmark data and wound image classification data, which shows ALARM's superior performance and its generic applicability across different domains for reliable decision-making.</p></details> |  | None |

We present a photonic Bayesian machine that leverages the inherent randomness of chaotic light sources to enable uncertainty reasoning within the framework of Bayesian Neural Networks. The analog processor features a 1.28 Tbit/s digital interface compatible with PyTorch, enabling probabilistic convolutions processing within 37.5 ps per convolution. We use the system for simultaneous classification and out-of-domain detection of blood cell microscope images and demonstrate reasoning between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The photonic Bayesian machine removes the bottleneck of pseudo random number generation in digital systems, minimizes the cost of sampling for probabilistic models, and thus enables high-speed trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures.

Although current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their accuracy and generalization are limited by the scarcity of failure data. To address this data gap, we propose an automatic robot failure synthesis approach that procedurally perturbs successful trajectories to generate diverse planning and execution failures. This method produces not only binary classification labels but also fine-grained failure categories and step-by-step reasoning traces in both simulation and the real world. With it, we construct three new failure detection benchmarks: RLBench-Fail, BridgeDataV2-Fail, and UR5-Fail, substantially expanding the diversity and scale of existing failure datasets. We then train Guardian, a VLM with multi-view images for detailed failure reasoning and detection. Guardian achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks. It also effectively improves task success rates when integrated into a state-of-the-art manipulation system in simulation and real robots, demonstrating the impact of our generated failure data.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI AISI Track, 2026</p></details> | None |

While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures and 7 tables</p></details> | None |

Using these patterns, the model can predict patient survival and classify tumor subtypes.

| **[GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01675v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable high-fidelity generation across diverse prompts. However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability. Our method is lightweight, scalable, and readily integrates with diffusion pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models.

| **[TomoGraphView: 3D Medical Image Classification with Omnidirectional Slice Representations and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09605v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume.

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |

Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significant progress in automated retinal analysis, supporting tasks such as fundus image classification, lesion detection, and vessel segmentation. As a representative lightweight network, nnMobileNet has demonstrated strong performance across multiple retinal benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. However, purely convolutional architectures inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model the irregular lesions and elongated vascular patterns that characterize on retinal images, despite the critical importance of vascular features for reliable clinical diagnosis. To further advance this line of work and extend the original vision of nnMobileNet, we propose nnMobileNet++, a hybrid architecture that progressively bridges convolutional and transformer representations. The framework integrates three key components: (i) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, (ii) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and (iii) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification, together with ablation studies, demonstrate that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost, underscoring its potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VeFA: Vector-Based Feature Space Adaptation for Robust Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19155v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting is a well-documented challenge in model fine-tuning, particularly when the downstream domain has limited labeled data or differs substantially from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods largely operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the parameters of the pre-trained model, which can lead to models that are overly specialized to the observed downstream data. Recent studies suggest that one mechanism underlying such forgetting is the introduction of intruder dimensions into the representation space during fine-tuning. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and to enhance robustness, we propose Vector-based Feature Adaptation (VeFA), a new fine-tuning method that operates directly in the feature space, which naturally avoids generating intruder dimensions. VeFA performs element-wise adaptation on individual features, thereby ensuring that the effective fine-tuned weights always remain within the column space of the pre-trained weight matrix. This feature-space adaptation perspective is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of downstream lurking variables that induce distribution shifts, which posits that the influence of unobserved factors can be represented as an equivalent aggregate effect on observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, VeFA preserves the pre-trained representations and improves model generalization under distribution shift. We evaluate VeFA against LoRA on image classification, NLU, and NLG benchmarks, considering both standard fine-tuning performance and robustness; across these tasks, VeFA achieves comparable fine-tuning performance while consistently exhibiting stronger robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

This is motivated by the "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis", which suggests the existence of smaller sub-networks within larger pre-trained networks that perform comparatively well (if not better). Whilst most literature in this area focuses on Deep Neural Networks more generally, we specifically consider Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. Building on the hypothesis, we compare simple magnitude-based pruning, a Frank-Wolfe style pruning scheme, and an FW method with momentum on a CNN trained on MNIST. Our experiments track test accuracy, loss, sparsity, and inference time as we vary the dense pre-training budget from 1 to 10 epochs. We find that FW with momentum yields pruned networks that are both sparser and more accurate than the original dense model and the simple pruning baselines, while incurring minimal inference-time overhead in our implementation. Moreover, FW with momentum reaches these accuracies after only a few epochs of pre-training, indicating that full pre-training of the dense model is not required in this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary preprint; numerical experiments are still being validated and may be updated in future revisions</p></details> | None |

Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications.

| **[Optimizing against Infeasible Inclusions from Data for Semantic Segmentation through Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14672v7)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models are typically optimized in a data-driven fashion, minimizing solely per-pixel or per-segment classification objectives on their training data. This purely data-driven paradigm often leads to absurd segmentations, especially when the domain of input images is shifted from the one encountered during training. For instance, state-of-the-art models may assign the label "road" to a segment that is included by another segment that is respectively labeled as "sky". However, the ground truth of the existing dataset at hand dictates that such inclusion is not feasible. Our method, Infeasible Semantic Inclusions (InSeIn), first extracts explicit inclusion constraints that govern spatial class relations from the semantic segmentation training set at hand in an offline, data-driven fashion, and then enforces a morphological yet differentiable loss that penalizes violations of these constraints during training to promote prediction feasibility. InSeIn is a light-weight plug-and-play method, constitutes a novel step towards minimizing infeasible semantic inclusions in the predictions of learned segmentation models, and yields consistent and significant performance improvements over diverse state-of-the-art networks across the ADE20K, Cityscapes, and ACDC datasets. https://github.com/SHAMIK-97/InSeIn</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2026 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SHAMIK-97/InSeIn) |
| **[TRoVe: Discovering Error-Inducing Static Feature Biases in Temporal Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01048v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have made great strides in addressing temporal understanding tasks, which involve characterizing visual changes across a sequence of images. However, recent works have suggested that when making predictions, VLMs may rely on static feature biases, such as background or object features, rather than dynamic visual changes. Static feature biases are a type of shortcut and can contribute to systematic prediction errors on downstream tasks; as a result, identifying and characterizing error-inducing static feature biases is critical prior to real-world model deployment. In this work, we introduce TRoVe, an automated approach for discovering error-inducing static feature biases learned by temporal VLMs. Given a trained VLM and an annotated validation dataset associated with a downstream classification task, TRoVe extracts candidate static features from the dataset and scores each feature by (i) the effect of the feature on classification errors as well as (ii) the extent to which the VLM relies on the feature when making predictions. In order to quantitatively evaluate TRoVe, we introduce an evaluation framework consisting of 101 trained temporal VLMs paired with ground-truth annotations for learned static feature biases. We use this framework to demonstrate that TRoVe can accurately identify error-inducing static feature biases in VLMs, achieving a 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline. Finally, we apply TRoVe to 7 off-the-shelf VLMs and 2 temporal understanding tasks, surfacing previously-unknown static feature biases and demonstrating that knowledge of learned biases can aid in improving model performance at test time.

Existing methods often yield suboptimal performance in generating high-quality 3D medical images, and there is currently no universal generative framework for medical imaging. In this paper, we introduce a 3D Medical Latent Diffusion (3D MedDiffusion) model for controllable, high-quality 3D medical image generation. 3D MedDiffusion incorporates a novel, highly efficient Patch-Volume Autoencoder that compresses medical images into latent space through patch-wise encoding and recovers back into image space through volume-wise decoding. Additionally, we design a new noise estimator to capture both local details and global structural information during diffusion denoising process. 3D MedDiffusion can generate fine-detailed, high-resolution images (up to 512x512x512) and effectively adapt to various downstream tasks as it is trained on large-scale datasets covering CT and MRI modalities and different anatomical regions (from head to leg). Experimental results demonstrate that 3D MedDiffusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generative quality and exhibits strong generalizability across tasks such as sparse-view CT reconstruction, fast MRI reconstruction, and data augmentation for segmentation and classification.

Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve. To ensure scalability, we develop an efficient approximation of Semantic Shift that replaces costly SVD computations, achieving a 15~30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Extensive evaluations across six real-world text and image datasets show that SFSes outperform standard classifiers not only in classification but also in nuanced tasks such as political bias detection, while SAFARI consistently reveals interpretable and generalizable semantic hierarchies. This work presents a unified framework for structuring, analyzing, and scaling semantic understanding in embedding spaces.</p></details> |  | None |

Forward-Forward is a novel training algorithm that is more similar to what occurs in the brain, although there is a significant performance gap compared to backpropagation. In the Forward-Forward algorithm, the loss functions are placed after each layer, and the updating of a layer is done using two local forward passes and one local backward pass. Forward-Forward is in its early stages and has been designed and evaluated on simple multi-layer perceptron networks to solve image classification tasks. In this work, we have extended the use of this algorithm to a more complex and modern network, namely the Vision Transformer. Inspired by insights from contrastive learning, we have attempted to revise this algorithm, leading to the introduction of Contrastive Forward-Forward. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the baseline Forward-Forward leading to an increase of up to 10% in accuracy and accelerating the convergence speed by 5 to 20 times. Furthermore, if we take Cross Entropy as the baseline loss function in backpropagation, it will be demonstrated that the proposed modifications to the baseline Forward-Forward reduce its performance gap compared to backpropagation on Vision Transformer, and even outperforms it in certain conditions, such as inaccurate supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated text and added pointer to the published Neural Networks version</p></details> | None |

In real settings, numbers often occur as multiple digits, all written by the same person. Examples include ZIP Codes, handwritten check amounts, and appointment times. In this work, we leverage knowledge about the writers of NIST digit images to create more realistic benchmark multi-digit writer (MDW) data sets. As expected, we find that classifiers may perform well on isolated digits yet do poorly on multi-digit number recognition. If we want to solve real number recognition problems, additional advances are needed. The MDW benchmarks come with task-specific performance metrics that go beyond typical error calculations to more closely align with real-world impact. They also create opportunities to develop methods that can leverage task-specific knowledge to improve performance well beyond that of individual digit classification methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14. Our results indicate that hybrid QCNN architectures can leverage entanglement and quantum feature fusion to enhance medical image classification tasks. This work establishes a statistical validation framework for assessing hybrid quantum models in biomedical applications and highlights pathways for scaling to larger datasets and deployment on near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MOON: Generative MLLM-based Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11999v4)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2026. 11 pages, 9 figures</p></details> | None |

We introduce MedCT-VLM: Medical CT Vision-Language Model, a parameter-efficient vision-language framework designed to adapt large-scale CT foundation models for downstream clinical tasks. MedCT-VLM uses a parameter-efficient approach to adapt CT-CLIP, a contrastive vision-language model trained on 25,692 chest CT volumes, for multi-label pathology classification using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Rather than fine-tuning the model's 440 M parameters directly, we insert low-rank decomposition matrices into attention layers of both vision and text encoders, training only 1.67M parameters (0.38\% of total). We evaluate on zero-shot classification across 18 thoracic pathologies, where the model must align CT embeddings with unseen text prompts at inference without task-specific training. LoRA fine-tuning improves mean AUROC from 61.3\% to 68.9\% (+7.6 pp), accuracy from 67.2\% to 73.6\% (+6.4 pp), and macro-F1 from 32.1\% to 36.9\% (+4.8 pp). These results demonstrate that parameter-efficient methods can effectively transfer large-scale pretraining to downstream medical imaging tasks, particularly for zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> |  | None |

Automated yoga pose classification has therefore gained importance to reduce reliance on expert practitioners. While human pose keypoint extraction models have shown high potential in action recognition, systematic benchmarking for yoga pose recognition remains limited, as prior works often focus solely on raw images or a single pose extraction model. In this study, we introduce a curated dataset, 'Yoga-16', which addresses limitations of existing datasets, and systematically evaluate three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception) using three input modalities (direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images). Our experiments demonstrate that skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs, with the highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Additionally, we provide interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM, offering insights into model decision-making for yoga pose classification with cross validation analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ICAS: Detecting Training Data from Autoregressive Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05068v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response, training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference, exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other autoregressive paradigms.

We present Task-Aligned Context Selection (TACS), a framework that learns to select paired examples which truly improve task performance rather than those that merely appear similar. TACS jointly trains a selector network with the task model through a hybrid optimization scheme combining gradient-based supervision and reinforcement learning, making retrieval part of the learning objective. By aligning selection with task rewards, TACS enables discriminative models to discover which contextual examples genuinely help. Across 18 datasets covering fine-grained recognition, medical image classification, and medical image segmentation, TACS consistently outperforms similarity-based retrieval, particularly in challenging or data-limited settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Laser speckle sensing has recently emerged as a low-cost and non-destructive modality for material classification; however, prior work has either relied on computationally expensive backbone networks or addressed only limited subsets of materials. In this study, A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for speckle patterns is proposed, designed to minimize parameters while maintaining high discriminative power. Using the complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes spanning woods, acrylics, composites, textiles, metals, and paper-based products, the proposed model achieves 95.05% test accuracy, with macro and weighted F1-scores of 0.951. The network contains only 341k trainable parameters (~1.3 MB) -- over 70X fewer than ResNet-50 -- and achieves an inference speed of 295 images per second, enabling deployment on Raspberry Pi and Jetson-class devices. Furthermore, when materials are regrouped into nine and five practical families, recall exceeds 98% and approaches 100%, directly supporting power and speed preset selection in laser cutters. These results demonstrate that compact, domain-specific CNNs can outperform large backbones for speckle-based material classification, advancing the feasibility of material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

However, existing methods primarily consider global semantics with image-level constraints, which excessively reduces attention to the discriminative local context of the class and leads to a performance improvement bottleneck. Moreover, existing methods for generating augmented samples usually involve cutting and pasting rectangular or square regions, resulting in a loss of object part information. To mitigate the problem of inconsistency between the augmented image and the generated mixed label, existing methods usually require double forward propagation or rely on an external pre-trained network for object centering, which is inefficient. To overcome the above limitations, we propose LGCOAMix, an efficient context-aware and object-part-aware superpixel-based grid blending method for data augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a label mixing strategy using a superpixel attention approach has been proposed for cutmix-based data augmentation. It is the first instance of learning local features from discriminative superpixel-wise regions and cross-image superpixel contrasts. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that LGCOAMix outperforms state-of-the-art cutmix-based data augmentation methods on classification tasks, {and weakly supervised object location on CUB200-2011.} We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LGCOAMix not only for CNN networks, but also for Transformer networks.

Yet, training robust machine learning models typically requires large volumes of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to obtain in manufacturing. Moreover, defective samples are intrinsically rare, leading to severe class imbalance that degrades model performance. These data constraints hinder the widespread adoption of machine learning-based quality inspection methods in real production environments. Synthetic data generation (SDG) offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of large, balanced, and fully annotated datasets in an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable manner. This paper presents a hybrid SDG framework that integrates simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing to enable zero-shot learning for computer vision-based industrial part inspection without manual annotation. The SDG pipeline generates 12,960 labeled images in one hour by varying part geometry, lighting, and surface properties, and then compositing synthetic parts onto real image backgrounds. A two-stage architecture utilizing a YOLOv8n backbone for object detection and MobileNetV3-small for quality classification is trained exclusively on synthetic data and evaluated on 300 real industrial parts. The proposed approach achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy. Comparative evaluation against few-shot real-data baseline approaches demonstrates significant improvement. The proposed SDG-based approach achieves 90-91% balanced accuracy under severe class imbalance, while the baselines reach only 50% accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables annotation-free, scalable, and robust quality inspection for real-world manufacturing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the NAMRC 54</p></details> | None |

However, NSFW is becoming more common on mainstream platforms, with X now allowing such material. We examine the top 15 NSFW-restricted subreddits by size to explore the complexities of responsibly sharing adult content, aiming to balance ethical and legal considerations with monetization opportunities. We find that users often use NSFW subreddits as a social springboard, redirecting readers to private or specialized adult social platforms such as Telegram, Kik or OnlyFans for further interactions. They also directly negotiate image "trades" through credit cards or payment platforms such as PayPal, Bitcoin or Venmo. Disturbingly, we also find linguistic cues linked to non-consensual content sharing. To help platforms moderate such behavior, we trained a RoBERTa-based classification model, which outperforms GPT-4 and traditional classifiers such as logistic regression and random forest in identifying non-consensual content sharing, showing better performance in this specific task.

However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Previous work has addressed such challenges without relying on expensive group labels, typically by upweighting high-loss samples or balancing discovered clusters. However, these heuristic strategies lack direct connection to specific fairness metrics and cannot guarantee optimization of parity-based criteria like equal opportunity, which ensures equal chance to receive positive outcomes across groups. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm that directly optimizes parity-based fairness metrics through specifically designed training objectives, without requiring group labels. We leverage vision-language models to analyze sensitive attribute relevancy for individual samples, then formulate loss functions that mathematically connect to each target fairness metric. This enables flexible optimization of different fairness criteria based on application needs. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show that our metric-specific approach significantly improves parity-based fairness criteria and outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Network Inversion for Uncertainty-Aware Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23448v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. However the two problems have, until recently, separately been addressed. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution data more closely, with a significant drop in the uncertainty, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and uncertainty estimation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PowerCLIP: Powerset Alignment for Contrastive Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23170v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach.

| **[Analyzing Image Beyond Visual Aspect: Image Emotion Classification via Multiple-Affective Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23115v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating the Clinical Impact of Generative Inpainting on Bone Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23066v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative foundation models can remove visual artifacts through realistic image inpainting, but their impact on medical AI performance remains uncertain. Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Spatially Parallel All-optical Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23611v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Contrastive Heliophysical Image Pretraining for Solar Dynamics Observatory Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22958v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has revolutionized solar image analysis, yet most approaches train task-specific encoders from scratch or rely on natural-image pretraining that ignores the unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, suboptimal semantic flow within current architectures can hinder this potential: features encoding the richest high-level semantics are underutilized and diluted when propagating through decoding layers, impeding the formation of an explicit semantic bottleneck layer. To address this, we introduce self-conditioning, a lightweight mechanism that reshapes the model's layer-wise semantic hierarchy without external guidance. By aggregating and rerouting intermediate features to guide subsequent decoding layers, our method concentrates more high-level semantics, concurrently strengthening global generative guidance and forming more discriminative representations. This simple approach yields a dual-improvement trend across pixel-space UNet, UViT and latent-space DiT models with minimal overhead. Crucially, it creates an architectural semantic bridge that propagates discriminative improvements into generation and accommodates further techniques such as contrastive self-distillation. Experiments show that our enhanced models, especially self-conditioned DiT, are powerful dual learners that yield strong and transferable representations on image and dense classification tasks, surpassing various generative self-supervised models in linear probing while also improving or maintaining high generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version.

Many prior methods rely on geometric or semantic labels to classify traversable surfaces. However, such labels cannot distinguish visually similar surfaces that differ in material properties. Spectral sensors enable inference of material composition from surface reflectance measured across multiple wavelength bands. Although spectral sensing is gaining traction in robotics, widespread deployment remains constrained by the need for custom hardware integration, high sensor costs, and compute-intensive processing pipelines. In this paper, we present the RGB Image to Spectral Signature Neural Network (RS-Net), a deep neural network designed to bridge the gap between the accessibility of RGB sensing and the rich material information provided by spectral data. RS-Net predicts spectral signatures from RGB patches, which we map to terrain labels and friction coefficients. The resulting terrain classifications are integrated into a sampling-based motion planner for a wheeled robot operating in outdoor environments. Likewise, the friction estimates are incorporated into a contact-force-based MPC for a quadruped robot navigating slippery surfaces. Overall, our framework learns the task-relevant physical properties offline during training and thereafter relies solely on RGB sensing at run time.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, accepted to Robotic Computing & Communication</p></details> | None |

While multi modal imaging strategies are popular, they introduce logistical and economic barriers for routine farm level deployment. This work demonstrates that deep learning and classical machine learning may be judiciously combined to achieve robust surface anomaly categorization and severity estimation from planar visible band imagery alone. We introduce TinyViT which is a compact pipeline integrating Transformer based segmentation, spectral-spatial feature engineering, and ensemble regression. The system ingests consumer grade color camera mosaics of PV panels, classifies seven nuanced surface faults, and generates actionable severity grades for maintenance triage. By eliminating reliance on electroluminescence or IR sensors, our method enables affordable, scalable upkeep for resource limited installations, and advances the state of solar health monitoring toward universal field accessibility. Experiments on real public world datasets validate both classification and regression sub modules, achieving accuracy and interpretability competitive with specialized approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>3page...</summary><p>3pages, 2figures,ICGVIP 2025</p></details> | None |

Wrist-worn activity signals from the Psykose and Depresjon datasets were converted into 30 by 48 images and evaluated through a three-fold subject-wise split. Although all methods fitted the training data well, their behaviour on unseen data differed. VGG16 improved steadily but often settled at lower accuracy. ViT-B/16 reached strong results in some runs, but its performance shifted noticeably from fold to fold. CoAtNet-Tiny stood out as the most reliable, recording the highest average accuracy and the most stable curves across folds. It also produced the strongest precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for the underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes. Overall, the findings indicate that CoAtNet-Tiny performed most consistently on the actigraphy images, while VGG16 and ViT-B/16 yielded mixed results. These observations suggest that certain hybrid designs may be especially suited for mental-health work that relies on actigraphy-derived images.</p></details> |  | None |

Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures. These results suggest that description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.The project is available at https://github.com/weicongpang/LVC2-DViT.git</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/weicongpang/LVC2-DViT.git) |
| **[Fusion or Confusion? Assessing the impact of visible-thermal image fusion for automated wildlife detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22768v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation</p></details> | None |

Existing solutions fall short as they rely on untargeted random, model- or latent-based perturbations, due to difficulties in generating controlled input variations. In this work, we introduce Mimicry, a novel black-box test generator for fine-grained, targeted exploration of DL system boundaries. Mimicry performs boundary testing by leveraging the probabilistic nature of DL outputs to identify promising directions for exploration. It uses style-based GANs to disentangle input representations into content and style components, enabling controlled feature mixing to approximate the decision boundary. We evaluated Mimicry's effectiveness in generating boundary inputs for five widely used DL image classification systems of increasing complexity, comparing it to two baseline approaches. Our results show that Mimicry consistently identifies inputs closer to the decision boundary. It generates semantically meaningful boundary test cases that reveal new functional (mis)behaviors, while the baselines produce mainly corrupted or invalid inputs. Thanks to its enhanced control over latent space manipulations, Mimicry remains effective as dataset complexity increases, maintaining competitive diversity and higher validity rates, confirmed by human assessors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> | None |
| **[Stable-Drift: A Patient-Aware Latent Drift Replay Method for Stabilizing Representations in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22615v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When deep learning models are sequentially trained on new data, they tend to abruptly lose performance on previously learned tasks, a critical failure known as catastrophic forgetting. This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures | None |

However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

However, they often require large amounts of data and can exhibit biases, such as center or size bias, that limit their robustness and generalizability. This paper introduces ForAug, a novel data augmentation operation that addresses these challenges by explicitly imposing invariances into the training data, which are otherwise part of the neural network architecture. ForAug is constructed by using pretrained foundation models to separate and recombine foreground objects with different backgrounds. This recombination step enables us to take fine-grained control over object position and size, as well as background selection. We demonstrate that using ForAug significantly improves the accuracy of ViTs and other architectures by up to 4.5 percentage points (p.p.) on ImageNet, which translates to 7.3 p.p. on downstream tasks. Importantly, ForAug not only improves accuracy but also opens new ways to analyze model behavior and quantify biases. Namely, we introduce metrics for background robustness, foreground focus, center bias, and size bias and show that using ForAug during training substantially reduces these biases. In summary, ForAug provides a valuable tool for analyzing and mitigating biases, enabling the development of more robust and reliable computer vision models.

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains-particularly those requiring resource-efficient and domain-specific adaptations-has remained limited. In this work, a lightweight multimodal language model termed SAMChat is introduced, specifically adapted to analyze remote sensing imagery in secluded areas, including challenging missile launch sites. A new dataset, SAMData, was compiled by verifying hundreds of aerial images through expert review, and subtle military installations were highlighted via detailed captions. Supervised fine-tuning on a 2B parameter open-source MLLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations was performed, enabling more accurate and interpretable explanations. Additionally, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was leveraged to enhance the model's ability to detect critical domain-specific cues-such as defensive layouts and key military structures-while minimizing false positives on civilian scenes. Through empirical evaluations, it has been shown that SAMChat significantly outperforms both larger, general-purpose multimodal models and existing remote sensing adapted approaches on open-ended captioning and classification metrics. Over 80% recall and 98% precision were achieved on the newly proposed SAMData benchmark, underscoring the potency of targeted fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in specialized real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (JSTARS) Special Issue on Foundation and Large Vision Models for Remote Sensing.

In real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost, followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a journal paper at Elsevier CIBM</p></details> | None |

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness. Compared with prior LLM-based systems, CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime, event-driven replanning on physical robots, delivering robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> | None |

We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Collapse of Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22281v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and Presented at IEEE UEMCON, IBM T.J.

| **[S2AFormer: Strip Self-Attention for Efficient Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22195v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has made significant advancements in computer vision, thanks to its token mixer's sophisticated ability to capture global dependencies between all tokens. However, the quadratic growth in computational demands as the number of tokens increases limits its practical efficiency. Although recent methods have combined the strengths of convolutions and self-attention to achieve better trade-offs, the expensive pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations inherent in self-attention remain a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose S2AFormer, an efficient Vision Transformer architecture featuring novel Strip Self-Attention (SSA). We design simple yet effective Hybrid Perception Blocks (HPBs) to effectively integrate the local perception capabilities of CNNs with the global context modeling of Transformer's attention mechanisms. A key innovation of SSA lies in its reduction of the spatial dimensions of $K$ and $V$, while compressing the channel dimensions of $Q$ and $K$. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving accuracy, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We evaluate the robustness and efficiency of S2AFormer through extensive experiments on multiple vision benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for image classification, ADE20k for semantic segmentation, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation. Results demonstrate that S2AFormer achieves significant accuracy gains with superior efficiency in both GPU and non-GPU environments, making it a strong candidate for efficient vision Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE-TIP, 14 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Autonomous labeling of surgical resection margins using a foundation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22131v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 5 Figures | None |
| **[Support Vector Machine Classifier with Rescaled Huberized Pinball Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22065v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Support vector machines are widely used in machine learning classification tasks, but traditional SVM models suffer from sensitivity to outliers and instability in resampling, which limits their performance in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel rescaled Huberized pinball loss function with asymmetric, non-convex, and smooth properties. Based on this loss function, we develop a corresponding SVM model called RHPSVM (Rescaled Huberized Pinball Loss Support Vector Machine). Theoretical analyses demonstrate that RHPSVM conforms to Bayesian rules, has a strict generalization error bound, a bounded influence function, and controllable optimality conditions, ensuring excellent classification accuracy, outlier insensitivity, and resampling stability. Additionally, RHPSVM can be extended to various advanced SVM variants by adjusting parameters, enhancing its flexibility. We transform the non-convex optimization problem of RHPSVM into a series of convex subproblems using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and solve it with the ClipDCD algorithm, which is proven to be convergent. Experimental results on simulated data, UCI datasets, and small-sample crop leaf image classification tasks show that RHPSVM outperforms existing SVM models in both noisy and noise-free scenarios, especially in handling high-dimensional small-sample data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Histomorphology-Guided Prototypical Multi-Instance Learning for Breast Cancer WSI Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17983v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histomorphology is crucial in cancer diagnosis. However, existing whole slide image (WSI) classification methods struggle to effectively incorporate histomorphology information, limiting their ability to capture key pathological features. Particularly when the number of instances within a bag is large and their features are complex, it becomes challenging to accurately identify instances decisive for the bag label, making these methods prone to interference from ambiguous instances. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Histomorphology-Guided Prototypical Multi-Instance Learning (HGPMIL) framework that explicitly learns histomorphology-guided prototypical representations by incorporating tumor cellularity, cellular morphology, and tissue architecture. Specifically, our approach consists of three key components: (1) estimating the importance of tumor-related histomorphology information at patch-level based on medical prior knowledge; (2) generating representative prototypes through histomorphology-prototypical clustering; and (3) enabling WSI classification through histomorphology-guided prototypical aggregation. HGPMIL adjusts the decision boundary by incorporating histomorphological importance to reduce instance label uncertainty, thereby reversely optimizing the bag-level boundary. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving high diagnostic accuracy for molecular subtyping, cancer subtyping and survival analysis. The code will be made available at https://github.com/Badgewho/HMDMIL.</p></details> | 11 pages,8 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Badgewho/HMDMIL) |

We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

| **[When Do Domain-Specific Foundation Models Justify Their Cost? A Systematic Evaluation Across Retinal Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22001v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision foundation models have been widely adopted for retinal disease classification without systematic evidence justifying their parameter requirements. In the present work we address two critical questions: First, are large domain-specific foundation models essential, or do compact general-purpose architectures suffice? Second, does specialized retinal pretraining justify its computational cost? To answer this, we benchmark initialization strategies across four retinal imaging classification tasks spanning Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Color Fundus Photography (CFP) modalities: 8-class OCT classification, 3-class diabetic macular edema (DME), 5-class diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 3-class glaucoma (GL) detection. We evaluate 12-13 model configurations per task, including vision transformers (22.8M-86.6M parameters), Swin Transformers (27.6M-28.3M), ConvNeXt (28.6M), and the domain-specific RETFound models (303M), under identical training conditions. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions: First, we demonstrate that pretraining provides universal benefits (5.18-18.41% improvement), scaling with task difficulty. Second, compact architectures (27-29M) dominate Pareto frontiers; SwinV2-tiny achieves top-1 performance on three datasets. Third, RETFound (303M) justifies its computational cost only for challenging DR grading (accuracy of 71.15%), while ImageNet pretraining proves to be sufficient with all other tasks (DME accuracy: 99.24%, OCT accuracy: 97.96%). CFP tasks show larger pretraining accuracy gains (9.13-18.41%) than OCT (5.18%). Thus, the evidence suggests that compact general-purpose models deliver near-optimal performance for most retinal classification tasks; specialized foundation models warranted only for fine-grained discrimination under extreme class imbalance.</p></details> |  | None |

It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over the best-performing baselines.

In a SemImage, each word is represented as a pixel in a 2D image: rows correspond to sentences and an additional boundary row is inserted between sentences to mark semantic transitions. Each pixel is not a typical RGB value but a vector in a disentangled HSV color space, encoding different linguistic features: the Hue with two components H_cos and H_sin to account for circularity encodes the topic, Saturation encodes the sentiment, and Value encodes intensity or certainty. We enforce this disentanglement via a multi-task learning framework: a ColorMapper network maps each word embedding to the HSV space, and auxiliary supervision is applied to the Hue and Saturation channels to predict topic and sentiment labels, alongside the main task objective. The insertion of dynamically computed boundary rows between sentences yields sharp visual boundaries in the image when consecutive sentences are semantically dissimilar, effectively making paragraph breaks salient. We integrate SemImage with standard 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet) for document classification. Experiments on multi-label datasets (with both topic and sentiment annotations) and single-label benchmarks demonstrate that SemImage can achieve competitive or better accuracy than strong text classification baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) while offering enhanced interpretability. An ablation study confirms the importance of the multi-channel HSV representation and the dynamic boundary rows. Finally, we present visualizations of SemImage that qualitatively reveal clear patterns corresponding to topic shifts and sentiment changes in the generated image, suggesting that our representation makes these linguistic features visible to both humans and machines.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the study confronts common endoscopic challenges such as variable lighting, fluctuating camera angles, and frequent imaging artifacts. The best performing models, VGG16 and MobileNetV2, each achieved a test accuracy of 96.5%, while Xception reached 94.24%, establishing robust benchmarks and baselines for automated disease classification. In addition to strong classification performance, the approach includes explainable AI via Grad-CAM visualization, enabling identification of image regions most influential to model predictions and enhancing clinical interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate the potential for robust, accurate, and interpretable medical image analysis even in complex real-world conditions.

| **[Evaluating Strategies for Synthesizing Clinical Notes for Medical Multimodal AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21827v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | ACM MMSys 2025 | None |

However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits. We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.</p></details> |  | None |

Early diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules in CT images can have a significant impact on reducing disease mortality and morbidity. In this work, we propose LMLCC-Net, a novel deep learning framework for classifying nodules from CT scan images using a 3D CNN, considering Hounsfield Unit (HU)-based intensity filtering. Benign and malignant nodules have significant differences in their intensity profile of HU, which was not exploited in the literature. Our method considers the intensity pattern as well as the texture for the prediction of malignancies. LMLCC-Net extracts features from multiple branches that each use a separate learnable HU-based intensity filtering stage. Various combinations of branches and learnable ranges of filters were explored to finally produce the best-performing model. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning scheme for labeling ambiguous cases and also developed a lightweight model to classify the nodules. The experimental evaluations are carried out on the LUNA16 dataset. The proposed LMLCC-Net was evaluated using the LUNA16 dataset. Our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 91.96%, a sensitivity of 92.94%, and an area under the curve of 94.07%, showing improved performance compared to existing methods The proposed method can have a significant impact in helping radiologists in the classification of pulmonary nodules and improving patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

We introduce a new cost-effective strategy for improving the uncertainty quantification and downstream decisions of a large model (e.g. a fine-tuned ViT-B): coupling it with a less accurate but much smaller "sidekick" (e.g. a fine-tuned ResNet-34) with a fraction of the computational cost. We propose aggregating the predictions of this Asymmetric Duo by simple learned weighted averaging. Surprisingly, despite their inherent asymmetry, the sidekick model almost never harms the performance of the larger model. In fact, across five image classification benchmarks and a variety of model architectures and training schemes (including soups), Asymmetric Duos significantly improve accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and selective classification metrics with only ${\sim}10-20\%$ more computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 14 figures, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Among various NNW approaches, weight-based methods are favored for their simplicity and practicality; however, they remain vulnerable to forging and overwriting attacks. To address those challenges, we propose NeuralMark, a robust method built around a hashed watermark filter. Specifically, we utilize a hash function to generate an irreversible binary watermark from a secret key, which is then used as a filter to select the model parameters for embedding. This design cleverly intertwines the embedding parameters with the hashed watermark, providing a robust defense against both forging and overwriting attacks. An average pooling is also incorporated to resist fine-tuning and pruning attacks. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into various neural network architectures, ensuring broad applicability. Theoretically, we analyze its security boundary. Empirically, we verify its effectiveness and robustness across 13 distinct Convolutional and Transformer architectures, covering five image classification tasks and one text generation task.

Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-Weighted Feature Fusion Network (DWFF-Net). The encoder of this model utilizes a frozen-parameter DINOv3 to extract foundational features. By analyzing the relationships between different category images and feature maps, we introduce a data-level adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for feature fusion. The decoder incorporates a dynamic weight computation network to achieve thorough integration of multi-layer features, and a hybrid loss function is adopted to optimize model training. Experimental results on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 69.79% and an F1-score of 80.49%, outperforming the baseline network by 2.1% and 1.61%, respectively. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary nature of multi-layer feature fusion, which effectively improves the IoU for micro-habitat categories such as field ridges. This study establishes a habitat identification framework for cultivated land systems based on adaptive multi-layer feature fusion, enabling sub-meter precision habitat mapping at a low cost and providing robust technical support for fine-grained habitat monitoring in cultivated landscapes.

However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Although recent advances in self-supervised learning and masked image modeling (MIM) have enabled SAR foundation models, these methods largely emphasize low-level visual features and often overlook multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition in SAR imagery. To address this, we construct SARVLM-1M, a large-scale vision-language dataset with over one million image-text pairs aggregated from existing datasets. We further propose a domain transfer training strategy to mitigate the large gap between natural and SAR imagery. Building on this, we develop SARVLM, the first vision language foundation model (VLM) tailored to SAR, comprising SARCLIP and SARCap. SARVLM is trained with a vision-language contrastive objective under the proposed domain transfer strategy, bridging SAR imagery and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on image text retrieval, zero-shot classification, semantic localization, and imagery captioning demonstrate that SARVLM delivers superior feature extraction and interpretation, outperforming state-of-the-art VLMs and advancing SAR semantic understanding.

As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages,6figures,one column</p></details> | None |

This paper revisits the fundamental assumptions underlying image classification and suggests that representing data as one-hot labels is a key factor that leads to vulnerabilities. However, in real-world datasets, data ambiguity often arises, with samples exhibiting characteristics of multiple classes, rendering one-hot label representations imprecise. To address this, we introduce a novel approach, Low-Temperature Distillation (LTD), designed to refine label representations. Unlike previous approaches, LTD incorporates a relatively low temperature in the teacher model, while maintaining a fixed temperature for the student model during both training and inference. This strategy not only refines assumptions about data distribution but also strengthens model robustness and avoids the gradient masking problem commonly encountered in defensive distillation. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method when combined with existing frameworks, achieving robust accuracy rates of 58.19%, 31.13%, and 42.08% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, respectively, without the need for additional data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-world applications often involve multi-label scenarios, such as image retrieval and medical imaging. Therefore, this paper focuses on the challenging yet practical multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) problem. In addition to the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, MLCIL encounters issues related to feature confusion, encompassing inter-session and intra-feature confusion. To address these problems, we propose a novel MLCIL approach called class-independent increment (CLIN). Specifically, in contrast to existing methods that extract image-level features, we propose a class-independent incremental network (CINet) to extract multiple class-level embeddings for multi-label samples. It learns and preserves the knowledge of different classes by constructing class-specific tokens. On this basis, we develop two novel loss functions, optimizing the learning of class-specific tokens and class-level embeddings, respectively. These losses aim to distinguish between new and old classes, further alleviating the problem of feature confusion. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for improving recognition performance and mitigating forgetting on various MLCIL tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Weak-to-Strong Generalization under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21332v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts, often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30% on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to automatically identify trustworthy supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025; affiliations and acknowledgements updated</p></details> | None |

However, current multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS'25</p></details> | None |

However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Hopfield Network: Rethinking Similarities in Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20609v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Associative memory models are content-addressable memory systems fundamental to biological intelligence and are notable for their high interpretability. However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling for Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> | [Code Link](https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe) |

They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HVAdam: A Full-Dimension Adaptive Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20277v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have achieved great success in training large-scale models like large language models and diffusion models. However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ScenarioCLIP: Pretrained Transferable Visual Language Models and Action-Genome Dataset for Natural Scene Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20274v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Until recently, the general corpus of CLIP-type fundamental models has widely explored either the retrieval of short descriptions or the classification of objects in the scene as SINGLE-object image classification task. The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks.

Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging. We release our code at https://github.com/omerb01/didicm .</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/omerb01/didicm) |

However, the limited availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives. These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review process.</p></details> |  | None |

While this is readily applicable to data such as images, which can be represented as regular grids in the Euclidean space, extending the convolution operator to work on graphs proves more challenging, due to their irregular structure. In this paper, we propose to use graph kernels, i.e. kernel functions that compute an inner product on graphs, to extend the standard convolution operator to the graph domain. This allows us to define an entirely structural model that does not require computing the embedding of the input graph. Our architecture allows to plug-in any type of graph kernels and has the added benefit of providing some interpretability in terms of the structural masks that are learned during the training process, similarly to what happens for convolutional masks in traditional convolutional neural networks. We perform an extensive ablation study to investigate the model hyper-parameters' impact and show that our model achieves competitive performance on standard graph classification and regression datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we first propose a dataset for early identification of forest fires through visual analysis. Unlike existing image corpuses that contain images of wide-spread fire, our dataset consists of multiple instances of smoke plumes and fire that indicates the initiation of fire. We obtained this dataset synthetically by utilising game simulators such as Red Dead Redemption 2. We also combined our dataset with already published images to obtain a more comprehensive set. Finally, we compared image classification and localisation methods on the proposed dataset.

We address this limitation by proposing \textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a novel diffusion-inspired loss function that provides dense, step-wise supervision, training the model to build confidence as it gathers more visual evidence. We demonstrate that MambaEye exhibits robust performance across a wide range of image resolutions, especially at higher resolutions such as $1536^2$ on the ImageNet-1K classification task. This feat is achieved while maintaining linear time and memory complexity relative to the number of patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released in github</p></details> | None |

Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future.

However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks. Fewer than 100 PCs calculated from any one task could perform all other tasks with nearly zero performance degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, conformal prediction has been used to quantify the uncertainty that the inverse problem contributes to downstream tasks like image classification, image quality assessment, fat mass quantification, etc. While existing works handle only a scalar estimation target, practical applications often involve multiple targets. In response, we propose an asymptotically minimax approach to multi-target conformal prediction that provides tight prediction intervals while ensuring joint marginal coverage. We then outline how our minimax approach can be applied to multi-metric blind image quality assessment, multi-task uncertainty quantification, and multi-round measurement acquisition. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the benefits of our minimax method, relative to existing multi-target conformal prediction methods, using both synthetic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

While deep-learning models for image segmentation, such as U-Net-based baselines and change-detection models, are useful baselines, they often struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, yielding poor detection of highly damaged regions. The present work proposes a deep-learning framework that jointly processes pre- and post-disaster satellite images to obtain fine-grained pixel-level damage maps: Satellite-to-Street: Disaster Impact Estimator. The model uses a modified dual-input U-Net architecture with enhanced feature fusion to capture both the local structural changes as well as the broader contextual cues. Class-aware weighted loss functions are integrated in order to handle the dominance of undamaged pixels in real disaster datasets, thus enhancing sensitivity toward major and destroyed categories. Experimentation on publicly available disaster datasets shows improved localization and classification of structural damage when compared to traditional segmentation and baseline change-detection models. The resulting damage maps provide a rapid and consistent assessment mechanism to support and not replace expert decision-making, thus allowing more efficient, data-driven disaster management.</p></details> | 11 pages,9 figures | None |

However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Data on the Brain \& Mind</p></details> | None |

Multimodal neural networks have seen increasing use for identifying species to help automate this task, but they have two major drawbacks. First, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of their decision making process. Second, collecting genetic data is often expensive and requires invasive procedures, often necessitating researchers to capture or kill the target specimen. We address both of these problems by extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets), which are a popular and interpretable alternative to traditional neural networks, to the multimodal, cost-aware setting. We ensemble prototypes from each modality, using an associated weight to determine how much a given prediction relies on each modality. We further introduce methods to identify cases for which we do not need the expensive genetic information to make confident predictions. We demonstrate that our approach can intelligently allocate expensive genetic data for fine-grained distinctions while using abundant image data for clearer visual classifications and achieving comparable accuracy to models that consistently use both modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages. 16 figures. 10 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Medical Image Analysis through Geometric and Photometric transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13643v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image analysis suffers from a lack of labeled data due to several challenges including patient privacy and lack of experts. Although some AI models only perform well with large amounts of data, we will move to data augmentation where there is a solution to improve the performance of our models and increase the dataset size through traditional or advanced techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques on two different medical image datasets. In the first step, we applied some transformation techniques to the skin cancer dataset containing benign and malignant classes. Then, we trained the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the dataset before and after augmentation, which significantly improved test accuracy from 90.74% to 96.88% and decreased test loss from 0.7921 to 0.1468 after augmentation. In the second step, we used the Mixup technique by mixing two random images and their corresponding masks using the retina and blood vessels dataset, then we trained the U-net model and obtained the Dice coefficient which increased from 0 before augmentation to 0.4163 after augmentation. The result shows the effect of using data augmentation to increase the dataset size on the classification and segmentation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data. The generality of the proposed methodology promises its applicability to various domains related to medical multimedia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Int.

However, as the size of the models grows, conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients. Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process: first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy, and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while assuming limited-resource clients.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (main document) + 13 pages (suppl. mat.), 4 figures (main) + 11 figures (suppl. mat.), 6 tables (main) + 5 tables (suppl. mat.) + 4 algorithms (suppl. mat.)</p></details> | None |
| **[An Anatomy Aware Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Lung Cancer Tumor Stage Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19367v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable "black box" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.</p></details> |  | None |

Studies show that existing approaches often modify the classifier while leaving internal representations intact, resulting in incomplete forgetting. In this work, we extend the notion of unlearning to the representation level, deriving a three-term interplay between forgetting efficacy, retention fidelity, and class separation. Building on Neural Collapse theory, we show that the orthogonal projection of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) remains an ETF in a lower dimensional space, yielding a provably optimal forgetting operator. We further introduce the Representation Unlearning Score (RUS) to quantify representation-level forgetting and retention fidelity. Building on this, we introduce POUR (Provably Optimal Unlearning of Representations), a geometric projection method with closed-form (POUR-P) and a feature-level unlearning variant under a distillation scheme (POUR-D). Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and PathMNIST demonstrate that POUR achieves effective unlearning while preserving retained knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art unlearning methods on both classification-level and representation-level metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Geometry of Cortical Computation: Manifold Disentanglement and Predictive Dynamics in VCNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02995v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations (NeurReps).

| **[Neural Architecture Search for Quantum Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19246v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters. This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MedBridge: Bridging Foundation Vision-Language Models to Medical Image Diagnosis in Chest X-Ray](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21698v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language foundation models deliver state-of-the-art results in natural image classification, but falter in medical images due to pronounced domain shifts. Training a medical foundation model also requires substantial resources, including extensive annotated data and high computational capacity. To bridge this gap with minimal overhead, we introduce MedBridge, a lightweight multimodal adaptation framework that flexibly re-purposes arbitrary pre-trained foundation VLMs for medical image diagnosis. MedBridge comprises three novel core components. First, a Focal Sampling module that subsamples and extracts high-resolution local regions to capture subtle pathological features, compensating for the limited input resolution of foundation VLMs. Second, a Query-Encoder model with a small set of learnable queries to align the feature maps of frozen VLMs with medical semantics, without requiring retraining of the backbone layers. Third, a Mixture of Experts mechanism, driven by learnable queries, harnesses the complementary strength of various VLMs to maximize diagnostic performance. We evaluate MedBridge on five chest radiograph benchmarks in three key adaptation tasks, demonstrating its superior performance in both cross-domain and in-domain adaptation settings under varying levels of training data availability. MedBridge achieved an improvement of 6-15% in AUC compared to state-of-the-art VLM adaptation methods in multi-label thoracic disease diagnosis, underscoring its effectiveness in leveraging diverse foundation models for accurate and data-efficient medical diagnosis.

| **[In-Situ Tweedie Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating continuous data such as images, adapting them to discrete tasks has relied on indirect approaches that either operate in continuous embedding spaces or use token masking mechanisms, both of which deviate from modeling the true discrete data distribution that can be theoretically guaranteed by Tweedie's formula. We propose in-situ Tweedie Discrete Diffusion (TDD), a framework that performs diffusion guaranteed by Tweedie's formula directly within the discrete one-hot space, hence "in-situ." Unlike prior methods that diffuse continuous embeddings or mask tokens, TDD directly corrupts one-hot vectors with Gaussian noise and performs iterative denoising through a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy objective rather than mean-squared-error reconstruction. At each denoising step, the model predicts class probabilities, applies argmax to obtain discrete predictions, converts them to one-hot vectors, and feeds them into the next iteration with progressively reduced noise. This process naturally unifies discriminative classification and generative modeling under a single framework. Experiments demonstrate that TDD achieves strong performance on both image classification and text generation tasks, with extensive ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each design component. Our work establishes a principled approach to discrete diffusion that preserves the core characteristics of diffusion models while operating natively in discrete space.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReefNet: A Large scale, Taxonomically Enriched Dataset and Benchmark for Hard Coral Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16822v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images, overlooking the localization of diffusion-based edits. We introduce DiffSeg30k, a publicly available dataset of 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, designed to support fine-grained detection. DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods.

For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM. We demonstrate the interest of such approach in terms of clustering and data embedding. We also establish different connections with other clustering approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE conference on Big Data (Special Session on Machine Learning)</p></details> | None |

Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Rigorous evaluations on the widely-used MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that PFADSeg exhibits excellent performance, achieving an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference manuscript accepted for oral presentation at CASEIB 2025</p></details> | None |

At the same time, hundreds of models get trained on biomedical data, submitted to challenges, and posted in model zoos and repositories. A major hurdle to wider adoption of pre-trained models lies in the lack of methods for best model selection. While such methods have been proposed for classification models, semantic and instance segmentation model ranking remain largely unaddressed, especially in a practically important setting where no labels are available on the target dataset. Similarly, if unsupervised domain adaptation is used, practitioners are faced with the task of selecting the best adapted model without target domain labels. Building on previous work linking model generalisation and consistency under perturbation, we propose the first unsupervised and source-free transferability estimator for semantic and instance segmentation tasks. We evaluate on multiple segmentation problems across biomedical imaging, finding a strong correlation between the rankings based on our estimator and rankings based on target dataset performance.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, traditional knowledge distillation methods treat all teacher predictions equally, regardless of the teacher's confidence in those predictions. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware dual-student knowledge distillation framework that leverages teacher prediction uncertainty to selectively guide student learning. We introduce a peer-learning mechanism where two heterogeneous student architectures, specifically ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2, learn collaboratively from both the teacher network and each other. Experimental results on ImageNet-100 demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline knowledge distillation methods, with ResNet-18 achieving 83.84\% top-1 accuracy and MobileNetV2 achieving 81.46\% top-1 accuracy, representing improvements of 2.04\% and 0.92\% respectively over traditional single-student distillation approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dendritic Convolution for Noise Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18699v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios of image recognition, there exists substantial noise interference. Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures | None |

We introduce EVCC (Enhanced Vision Transformer-ConvNeXt-CoAtNet), a novel multi-branch architecture integrating the Vision Transformer, lightweight ConvNeXt, and CoAtNet through key innovations: (1) adaptive token pruning with information preservation, (2) gated bidirectional cross-attention for enhanced feature refinement, (3) auxiliary classification heads for multi-task learning, and (4) a dynamic router gate employing context-aware confidence-driven weighting. Experiments across the CIFAR-100, Tobacco3482, CelebA, and Brain Cancer datasets demonstrate EVCC's superiority over powerful models like DeiT-Base, MaxViT-Base, and CrossViT-Base by consistently achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with improvements of up to 2 percentage points, while reducing FLOPs by 25 to 35%. Our adaptive architecture adjusts computational demands to deployment needs by dynamically reducing token count, efficiently balancing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off while combining global context, local details, and hierarchical features for real-world applications.

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the "fake" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence - 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Neural Collapse-Inspired Multi-Label Federated Learning under Label-Distribution Skew](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12544v3)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it remains challenging as data distributions can be highly heterogeneous. These challenges are further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data exhibit characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships. While most existing FL studies focus on single-label classification, real-world applications, such as in medical imaging, involve multi-label data with highly skewed label distributions across clients. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose FedNCA-ML, a novel FL framework that aligns feature distributions across clients and learns discriminative, well-clustered representations inspired by Neural Collapse (NC) theory. NC describes an ideal latent-space geometry where each class's features collapse to their mean, forming a maximally separated simplex. To extend this theory to multi-label settings, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that extracts class-specific representations. The clustering of these disentangled features is guided by a shared NC-inspired structure, mitigating conflicts among client models caused by heterogeneous local data. Furthermore, we design regularisation losses to encourage compact and consistent feature clustering in the latent space. Experiments on four benchmark datasets under eight FL settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving improvements of up to 3.92% in class-wise AUC and 4.93% in class-wise F1 score.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[In Search of Goodness: Large Scale Benchmarking of Goodness Functions for the Forward-Forward Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18567v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, enabling neural networks to learn through local updates. However, FF's efficacy relies heavily on the definition of "goodness", which is a scalar measure of neural activity. While current implementations predominantly utilize a simple sum-of-squares metric, it remains unclear if this default choice is optimal. To address this, we benchmarked 21 distinct goodness functions across four standard image datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10), evaluating classification accuracy, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. We found that certain alternative goodness functions inspired from various domains significantly outperform the standard baseline. Specifically, \texttt{game\_theoretic\_local} achieved 97.15\% accuracy on MNIST, \texttt{softmax\_energy\_margin\_local} reached 82.84\% on FashionMNIST, and \texttt{triplet\_margin\_local} attained 37.69\% on STL-10. Furthermore, we observed substantial variability in computational efficiency, highlighting a critical trade-off between predictive performance and environmental cost. These findings demonstrate that the goodness function is a pivotal hyperparameter in FF design. We release our code on \href{https://github.com/aryashah2k/In-Search-of-Goodness}{Github} for reference and reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 tables, 17 figures</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/aryashah2k/In-Search-of-Goodness) |

WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2026</p></details> | None |

Solar panel output can vary widely with factors like intensity, temperature, dirt, debris and so on affecting it. We have implemented a model on detecting dust and fault on solar panels. These two applications are centralized as a single-platform and can be utilized for routine-maintenance and any other checks. These are checked against various parameters such as power output, sinusoidal wave (I-V component of solar cell), voltage across each solar cell and others. Firstly, we filter and preprocess the obtained images using gamma removal and Gaussian filtering methods alongside some predefined processes like normalization. The first application is to detect whether a solar cell is dusty or not based on various pre-determined metrics like shadowing, leaf, droppings, air pollution and from other human activities to extent of fine-granular solar modules. The other one is detecting faults and other such occurrences on solar panels like faults, cracks, cell malfunction using thermal imaging application. This centralized platform can be vital since solar panels have different efficiency across different geography (air and heat affect) and can also be utilized for small-scale house requirements to large-scale solar farm sustentation effectively. It incorporates CNN, ResNet models that with self-attention mechanisms-KerNet model which are used for classification and results in a fine-tuned system that detects dust or any fault occurring. Thus, this multi-application model proves to be efficient and optimized in detecting dust and faults on solar panels. We have performed various comparisons and findings that demonstrates that our model has better efficiency and accuracy results overall than existing models.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its data and not the model architecture or pre-training objective. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3% on ViT-B models. Scaling to 1B data, while maintaining the same training budget, attains 72.4%. Our observations hold across various model sizes, exemplified by ViT-H achieving 80.5%, without any bells-and-whistles.

| **[A Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework with PKCP-MixUp Augmentation for Pediatric Liver Tumor Diagnosis Using Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19478v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pediatric liver tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatrics, with differentiation of benign or malignant status and pathological classification critical for clinical treatment. While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses. This framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides actionable insights for CT phase selection and model design, and paves the way for precise, accessible pediatric liver tumor diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Large-Scale Pre-training Enables Multimodal AI Differentiation of Radiation Necrosis from Brain Metastasis Progression on Routine MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18208v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Differentiating radiation necrosis (RN) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains a critical challenge in brain metastases. While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation.</p></details> |  | None |

While artificial intelligence can help standardize this evaluation, models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets, which are often unavailable due to data scarcity, natural class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative embryo models can mitigate these issues but face several limitations, such as poor image quality, small training datasets, non-robust evaluation, and lack of clinically relevant image generation for effective data augmentation. Here, we present the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) framework, a set of latent diffusion models trained to generate high-fidelity, novel day 5 blastocyst images. Our models provide granular control by conditioning on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. We rigorously evaluated the models using FID, a memorization metric, an embryologist Turing test, and three downstream classification tasks. Our results show that DIA models generate realistic images that embryologists could not reliably distinguish from real images. Most importantly, we demonstrated clear clinical value. Augmenting an imbalanced dataset with synthetic images significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0.05). Also, adding synthetic images to an already large, balanced dataset yielded statistically significant performance gains, and synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data in some cases without a statistically significant loss in accuracy. DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets. By generating novel, high-fidelity, and controllable synthetic images, our models can improve the performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is 23 pages, with five main figures and one table.

| **[Unified Spherical Frontend: Learning Rotation-Equivariant Representations of Spherical Images from Any Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18174v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern perception increasingly relies on fisheye, panoramic, and other wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, yet most pipelines still apply planar CNNs designed for pinhole imagery on 2D grids, where image-space neighborhoods misrepresent physical adjacency and models are sensitive to global rotations. Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations. USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently and maintains less than 1% performance drop under random test-time rotations, even without rotational augmentation, and even enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce WaveletMamba, a theory-driven framework integrating wavelet decomposition with state-space modeling, mathematical regularization, and multi-level bias correction. WaveletMamba achieves 81.72% +/- 0.53% classification accuracy at 64x64 resolution with only 3.54M parameters, delivering high-resolution performance (80.93% +/- 0.27% at 244x244) at low-resolution inputs with 9.7x computational efficiency gains. The framework exhibits Resolution Multistability, where models trained on low-resolution data achieve consistent accuracy across different input scales despite divergent internal representations. The framework's multi-level bias correction synergizes HK distance (distribution-level optimal transport) with Color-Aware Weighting (sample-level fine-tuning), achieving 22.96% Log-MSE improvement and 26.10% outlier reduction without explicit selection function modeling. Here, we show that mathematical rigor enables unprecedented efficiency and comprehensive bias correction in scientific AI, bridging computer vision and astrophysics to revolutionize interdisciplinary scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Bias Is a Subspace, Not a Coordinate: A Geometric Rethinking of Post-hoc Debiasing in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18123v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.</p></details> |  | None |

Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Finally, we show how AdaPerceiver equipped with a policy can maintain ImageNet1K accuracy ($\pm0.1$ percentage points) while reducing FLOPs by $24-33$%.</p></details> |  | None |

This study addresses whether complex neural networks are essential for the simple binary classification task of malaria. We introduce the Extracted Morphological Feature Engineered (EMFE) pipeline, a transparent, reproducible, and low compute machine learning approach tailored explicitly for simple cell morphology, designed to achieve deep learning performance levels on a simple CPU only setup with the practical aim of real world deployment. Methods: The study used the NIH Malaria Cell Images dataset, with two features extracted from each cell image: the number of non background pixels and the number of holes within the cell. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were compared against ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet across accuracy, model size, and CPU inference time. An ensemble model was created by combining Logistic Regression and Random Forests to achieve higher accuracy while retaining efficiency. Results: The single variable Logistic Regression model achieved a test accuracy of 94.80 percent with a file size of 1.2 kB and negligible inference latency (2.3 ms). The two stage ensemble improved accuracy to 97.15 percent. In contrast, the deep learning methods require 13.6 MB to 44.7 MB of storage and show significantly higher inference times (68 ms). Conclusion: This study shows that a compact feature engineering approach can produce clinically meaningful classification performance while offering gains in transparency, reproducibility, speed, and deployment feasibility. The proposed pipeline demonstrates that simple interpretable features paired with lightweight models can serve as a practical diagnostic solution for environments with limited computational resources.</p></details> |  | None |

Understanding Active Learning in Longitudinal Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18007v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting changes in longitudinal medical imaging using deep learning requires a substantial amount of accurately labeled data. However, labeling these images is notably more costly and time-consuming than labeling other image types, as it requires labeling across various time points, where new lesions can be minor, and subtle changes are easily missed. Deep Active Learning (DAL) has shown promise in minimizing labeling costs by selectively querying the most informative samples, but existing studies have primarily focused on static tasks like classification and segmentation. Consequently, the conventional DAL approach cannot be directly applied to change detection tasks, which involve identifying subtle differences across multiple images. In this study, we propose a novel DAL framework, named Longitudinal Medical Imaging Active Learning (LMI-AL), tailored specifically for longitudinal medical imaging. By pairing and differencing all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, LMI-AL iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL, training a deep learning model with minimal manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with less than 8% of the data labeled, LMI-AL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets. We also provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance, as guidance for future research.

In such an immersive environment, window/view management is crucial for collaborative sense-making tasks. However, the role of document types (graphs, images) and pair dynamics in collaborative layout formation has rarely been explored. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to explore how pair of users organize multiview windows in remote immersive workspaces during tasks such as search, comparison, and classification. Findings show that users often arrange windows in a semi-circular layout for pair collaboration. Image+text documents reduce mental and temporal demand in comparison tasks, while graphs lower task load for classification. Conflicts in window selection arise mainly in complex comparisons, with frequent discussion and reorganization during difficult tasks. Based on these insights, we propose design guidelines for multiview systems that support VR collaboration and brainstorming.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | None |

We revisit 3DGS optimization from a machine learning perspective, framing novel view synthesis as a generalization problem to unseen viewpoints-an underexplored direction. We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth. Across datasets with various configurations, our method consistently improves a wide range of baselines.

| **[Model Inversion Attack Against Deep Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12233v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep hashing improves retrieval efficiency through compact binary codes, yet it introduces severe and often overlooked privacy risks. The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents theoretical analysis to support its practical success. We provide convergence proofs for Muon across four practical settings, systematically examining its behavior with and without the inclusion of Nesterov momentum and weight decay. Our analysis covers the standard configuration using both, thereby elucidating its real-world performance. We then demonstrate that the addition of weight decay yields strictly tighter theoretical bounds and clarify the interplay between the weight decay coefficient and the learning rate. Finally, we derive the critical batch size for Muon that minimizes the computational cost of training. Our analysis identifies the hyperparameters governing this value, and our experiments validate the corresponding theoretical findings across workloads including image classification and language modeling task.</p></details> |  | None |

This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93).

| **[Interpretable and Testable Vision Features via Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06755v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To truly understand vision models, we must not only interpret their learned features but also validate these interpretations through controlled experiments. While earlier work offers either rich semantics or direct control, few post-hoc tools supply both in a single, model-agnostic procedure. We use sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to bridge this gap; each sparse feature comes with real-image exemplars that reveal its meaning and a decoding vector that can be manipulated to probe its influence on downstream task behavior. By applying our method to widely-used pre-trained vision models, we reveal meaningful differences in the semantic abstractions learned by different pre-training objectives. We then show that a single SAE trained on frozen ViT activations supports patch-level causal edits across tasks (classification and segmentation) all without retraining the ViT or task heads. These qualitative, falsifiable demonstrations position SAEs as a practical bridge between concept discovery and causal probing of vision models. We provide code, demos and models on our project website: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/saev.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text is 10 pages with 7 figures</p></details> | [Code Link](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/saev) |
| **[REMSA: An LLM Agent for Foundation Model Selection in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17442v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/be-chen/REMSA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/be-chen/REMSA) |
| **[Quantum Masked Autoencoders for Vision Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17372v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum computing and quantum autoencoders. In this paper, we propose quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) that can effectively learn missing features of a data sample within quantum states instead of classical embeddings. We showcase that our QMAE architecture can learn the masked features of an image and can reconstruct the masked input image with improved visual fidelity in MNIST images. Experimental evaluation highlights that QMAE can significantly outperform (12.86% on average) in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders in the presence of masks.</p></details> |  | None |
