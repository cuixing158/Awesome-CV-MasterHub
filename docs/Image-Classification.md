| **[S2AFormer: Strip Self-Attention for Efficient Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22195v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has made significant advancements in computer vision, thanks to its token mixer's sophisticated ability to capture global dependencies between all tokens. However, the quadratic growth in computational demands as the number of tokens increases limits its practical efficiency. Although recent methods have combined the strengths of convolutions and self-attention to achieve better trade-offs, the expensive pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations inherent in self-attention remain a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose S2AFormer, an efficient Vision Transformer architecture featuring novel Strip Self-Attention (SSA). We design simple yet effective Hybrid Perception Blocks (HPBs) to effectively integrate the local perception capabilities of CNNs with the global context modeling of Transformer's attention mechanisms. A key innovation of SSA lies in its reducing the spatial dimensions of $K$ and $V$ while compressing the channel dimensions of $Q$ and $K$. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving accuracy, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We evaluate the robustness and efficiency of S2AFormer through extensive experiments on multiple vision benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for image classification, ADE20k for semantic segmentation, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation. Results demonstrate that S2AFormer achieves significant accuracy gains with superior efficiency in both GPU and non-GPU environments, making it a strong candidate for efficient vision Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[CLIP-MoE: Towards Building Mixture of Experts for CLIP with Diversified Multiplet Upcycling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19291v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in multimodal intelligence. However, recent studies discovered that CLIP can only encode one aspect of the feature space, leading to substantial information loss and indistinctive features. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces a novel strategy that fine-tunes a series of complementary CLIP models and transforms them into a CLIP-MoE. Specifically, we propose a model-agnostic Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU) framework for CLIP. Instead of training multiple CLIP models from scratch, DMU leverages a pre-trained CLIP and fine-tunes it into a diverse set with highly cost-effective multistage contrastive learning, thus capturing distinct feature subspaces efficiently. To fully exploit these fine-tuned models while minimizing computational overhead, we transform them into a CLIP-MoE, which dynamically activates a subset of CLIP experts, achieving an effective balance between model capacity and computational cost. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of CLIP-MoE across various zero-shot retrieval, zero-shot image classification tasks, and downstream Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks when used as a vision encoder.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Meta Co-Training: Two Views are Better than One](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18083v5)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many critical computer vision scenarios unlabeled data is plentiful, but labels are scarce and difficult to obtain. As a result, semi-supervised learning which leverages unlabeled data to boost the performance of supervised classifiers have received significant attention in recent literature. One representative class of semi-supervised algorithms are co-training algorithms. Co-training algorithms leverage two different models which have access to different independent and sufficient representations or "views" of the data to jointly make better predictions. Each of these models creates pseudo-labels on unlabeled points which are used to improve the other model. We show that in the common case where independent views are not available, we can construct such views inexpensively using pre-trained models. Co-training on the constructed views yields a performance improvement over any of the individual views we construct and performance comparable with recent approaches in semi-supervised learning. We present Meta Co-Training, a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm, which has two advantages over co-training: (i) learning is more robust when there is large discrepancy between the information content of the different views, and (ii) does not require retraining from scratch on each iteration. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-10% achieving a ~4.7% reduction in error rate over prior work. Our method also outperforms prior semi-supervised work on several other fine-grained image classification datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables, for implementation see https://github.com/JayRothenberger/Meta-Co-Training</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/JayRothenberger/Meta-Co-Training) |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21844v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, test-time adaptation has attracted wide interest in the context of vision-language models for image classification. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem is completely overlooked in dense prediction tasks such as Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). In response, we propose a novel TTA method tailored to adapting VLMs for segmentation during test time. Unlike TTA methods for image classification, our Multi-Level and Multi-Prompt (MLMP) entropy minimization integrates features from intermediate vision-encoder layers and is performed with different text-prompt templates at both the global CLS token and local pixel-wise levels. Our approach could be used as plug-and-play for any segmentation network, does not require additional training data or labels, and remains effective even with a single test sample. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive OVSS TTA benchmark suite, which integrates a rigorous evaluation protocol, seven segmentation datasets, and 15 common corruptions, with a total of 82 distinct test scenarios, establishing a standardized and comprehensive testbed for future TTA research in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our experiments on this suite demonstrate that our segmentation-tailored method consistently delivers significant gains over direct adoption of TTA classification baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MedBridge: Bridging Foundation Vision-Language Models to Medical Image Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21698v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language foundation models deliver state-of-the-art results on natural image classification but falter on medical images due to pronounced domain shifts. At the same time, training a medical foundation model requires substantial resources, including extensive annotated data and high computational capacity. To bridge this gap with minimal overhead, we introduce MedBridge, a lightweight multimodal adaptation framework that re-purposes pretrained VLMs for accurate medical image diagnosis. MedBridge comprises three key components. First, a Focal Sampling module that extracts high-resolution local regions to capture subtle pathological features and compensate for the limited input resolution of general-purpose VLMs. Second, a Query Encoder (QEncoder) injects a small set of learnable queries that attend to the frozen feature maps of VLM, aligning them with medical semantics without retraining the entire backbone. Third, a Mixture of Experts mechanism, driven by learnable queries, harnesses the complementary strength of diverse VLMs to maximize diagnostic performance. We evaluate MedBridge on five medical imaging benchmarks across three key adaptation tasks, demonstrating its superior performance in both cross-domain and in-domain adaptation settings, even under varying levels of training data availability. Notably, MedBridge achieved over 6-15% improvement in AUC compared to state-of-the-art VLM adaptation methods in multi-label thoracic disease diagnosis, underscoring its effectiveness in leveraging foundation models for accurate and data-efficient medical diagnosis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ai-med/MedBridge.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ai-med/MedBridge) |
| **[Stochastic Online Conformal Prediction with Semi-Bandit Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13268v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction has emerged as an effective strategy for uncertainty quantification by modifying a model to output sets of labels instead of a single label. These prediction sets come with the guarantee that they contain the true label with high probability. However, conformal prediction typically requires a large calibration dataset of i.i.d. examples. We consider the online learning setting, where examples arrive over time, and the goal is to construct prediction sets dynamically. Departing from existing work, we assume semi-bandit feedback, where we only observe the true label if it is contained in the prediction set. For instance, consider calibrating a document retrieval model to a new domain; in this setting, a user would only be able to provide the true label if the target document is in the prediction set of retrieved documents. We propose a novel conformal prediction algorithm targeted at this setting, and prove that it obtains sublinear regret compared to the optimal conformal predictor. We evaluate our algorithm on a retrieval task, an image classification task, and an auction price-setting task, and demonstrate that it empirically achieves good performance compared to several baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Controlling Participation in Federated Learning with Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19242v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of client participation in federated learning, where traditional methods typically rely on a random selection of a small subset of clients for each training round. In contrast, we propose FedBack, a deterministic approach that leverages control-theoretic principles to manage client participation in ADMM-based federated learning. FedBack models client participation as a discrete-time dynamical system and employs an integral feedback controller to adjust each client's participation rate individually, based on the client's optimization dynamics. We provide global convergence guarantees for our approach by building on the recent federated learning research. Numerical experiments on federated image classification demonstrate that FedBack achieves up to 50\% improvement in communication and computational efficiency over algorithms that rely on a random selection of clients.</p></details> | L4DC 2025 | None |
| **[Quantum autoencoders for image classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15254v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical machine learning often struggles with complex, high-dimensional data. Quantum machine learning offers a potential solution, promising more efficient processing. The quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), a hybrid algorithm, fits current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. However, its training depends largely on classical computation. Future gate-based quantum computers may realize full quantum advantages. In contrast to QCNNs, quantum autoencoders (QAEs) leverage classical optimization solely for parameter tuning. Data compression and reconstruction are handled entirely within quantum circuits, enabling purely quantum-based feature extraction. This study introduces a novel image-classification approach using QAEs, achieving classification without requiring additional qubits compared with conventional QAE implementations. The quantum circuit structure significantly impacts classification accuracy. Unlike hybrid methods such as QCNN, QAE-based classification emphasizes quantum computation. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy in a four-class classification task, evaluating various quantum-gate configurations to understand the impact of different parameterized quantum circuit structures on classification performance. Specifically, noise-free conditions are considered, and simulations are performed using a statevector simulator to model the quantum system with full amplitude precision. Our results reveal that specific ansatz structures achieve superior accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of conventional machine-learning methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters requiring optimization. These findings indicate that QAEs can serve as efficient classification models with fewer parameters and highlight the potential of utilizing quantum circuits for complete end-to-end learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multiple Different Black Box Explanations for Image Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14309v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing explanation tools for image classifiers usually give only a single explanation for an image's classification. For many images, however, image classifiers accept more than one explanation for the image label. These explanations are useful for analyzing the decision process of the classifier and for detecting errors. Thus, restricting the number of explanations to just one severely limits insight into the behavior of the classifier. In this paper, we describe an algorithm and a tool, MultEX, for computing multiple explanations as the output of a black-box image classifier for a given image. Our algorithm uses a principled approach based on actual causality. We analyze its theoretical complexity and evaluate MultEX against the state-of-the-art across three different models and three different datasets. We find that MultEX finds more explanations and that these explanations are of higher quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Performance of Explainable AI Models with Constrained Concept Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06775v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trade-off between accuracy and interpretability has long been a challenge in machine learning (ML). This tension is particularly significant for emerging interpretable-by-design methods, which aim to redesign ML algorithms for trustworthy interpretability but often sacrifice accuracy in the process. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating the impact of deviations in concept representations-an essential component of interpretable models-on prediction performance and propose a novel framework to mitigate these effects. The framework builds on the principle of optimizing concept embeddings under constraints that preserve interpretability. Using a generative model as a test-bed, we rigorously prove that our algorithm achieves zero loss while progressively enhancing the interpretability of the resulting model. Additionally, we evaluate the practical performance of our proposed framework in generating explainable predictions for image classification tasks across various benchmarks. Compared to existing explainable methods, our approach not only improves prediction accuracy while preserving model interpretability across various large-scale benchmarks but also achieves this with significantly lower computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evidential Deep Active Learning for Semi-Supervised Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20691v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised classification based on active learning has made significant progress, but the existing methods often ignore the uncertainty estimation (or reliability) of the prediction results during the learning process, which makes it questionable whether the selected samples can effectively update the model. Hence, this paper proposes an evidential deep active learning approach for semi-supervised classification (EDALSSC). EDALSSC builds a semi-supervised learning framework to simultaneously quantify the uncertainty estimation of labeled and unlabeled data during the learning process. The uncertainty estimation of the former is associated with evidential deep learning, while that of the latter is modeled by combining ignorance information and conflict information of the evidence from the perspective of the T-conorm operator. Furthermore, this article constructs a heuristic method to dynamically balance the influence of evidence and the number of classes on uncertainty estimation to ensure that it does not produce counter-intuitive results in EDALSSC. For the sample selection strategy, EDALSSC selects the sample with the greatest uncertainty estimation that is calculated in the form of a sum when the training loss increases in the latter half of the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate that EDALSSC outperforms existing semi-supervised and supervised active learning approaches on image classification datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Lean classical-quantum hybrid neural network model for image classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02059v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of algorithms from quantum information with neural networks has enabled unprecedented advancements in various domains. Nonetheless, the application of quantum machine learning algorithms for image classification predominantly relies on traditional architectures such as variational quantum circuits. The performance of these models is closely tied to the scale of their parameters, with the substantial demand for parameters potentially leading to limitations in computational resources and a significant increase in computation time. In this paper, we introduce a Lean Classical-Quantum Hybrid Neural Network (LCQHNN), which achieves efficient classification performance with only four layers of variational circuits, thereby substantially reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that LCQHNN achieves 100\%, 99.02\%, and 85.55\% classification accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Under the same parameter conditions, the convergence speed of this method is also faster than that of traditional models. Furthermore, through visualization studies, it is found that the model effectively captures key data features during training and establishes a clear association between these features and their corresponding categories. This study confirms that the employment of quantum algorithms enhances the model's ability to handle complex classification problems.</p></details> | 18 pages,8 figures | None |
| **[Polynomial, trigonometric, and tropical activations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01247v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Which functions can be used as activations in deep neural networks? This article explores families of functions based on orthonormal bases, including the Hermite polynomial basis and the Fourier trigonometric basis, as well as a basis resulting from the tropicalization of a polynomial basis. Our study shows that, through simple variance-preserving initialization and without additional clamping mechanisms, these activations can successfully be used to train deep models, such as GPT-2 for next-token prediction on OpenWebText and ConvNeXt for image classification on ImageNet. Our work addresses the issue of exploding and vanishing activations and gradients, particularly prevalent with polynomial activations, and opens the door for improving the efficiency of large-scale learning tasks. Furthermore, our approach provides insight into the structure of neural networks, revealing that networks with polynomial activations can be interpreted as multivariate polynomial mappings. Finally, using Hermite interpolation, we show that our activations can closely approximate classical ones in pre-trained models by matching both the function and its derivative, making them especially useful for fine-tuning tasks. These activations are available in the torchortho library, which can be accessed via: https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho) |
| **[UORA: Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20154v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation (UORA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach for Large Language Models (LLMs). UORA achieves state-of-the-art performance and parameter efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method to reduce the number of trainable parameters. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UORA employs an interpolation-based reparametrization mechanism that selectively reinitializes rows and columns in frozen projection matrices, guided by the vector magnitude heuristic. This results in substantially fewer trainable parameters compared to LoRA and outperforms VeRA in computation and storage efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate UORA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with negligible computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and E2E benchmarks and its effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language models and image classification models. Our contributions establish a new paradigm for scalable and resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, 15 tables</p></details> | None |

We used the GAN-based augmentation strategy as a baseline and introduced several novel methods to further enhance our model. The proposed strategy contains U-GAT-IT for improving the generative part and uses the data balance technique to narrow down the skew of accuracy between all categories. The best model obtained was built with CBAM attention mechanism and fine-tuned InceptionV3, and achieved an overall accuracy of 97.85%, representing a significant improvement over the original baseline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Likelihood-Ratio Regularized Quantile Regression: Adapting Conformal Prediction to High-Dimensional Covariate Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13030v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Differential Privacy Analysis of Decentralized Gossip Averaging under Varying Threat Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19969v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully decentralized training of machine learning models offers significant advantages in scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance. However, achieving differential privacy (DP) in such settings is challenging due to the absence of a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. In this work, we present a novel privacy analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging algorithms with additive node-level noise, both with and without secure summation over each node's direct neighbors. Our main contribution is a new analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately characterizes privacy leakage across these scenarios. This framework significantly improves upon prior analyses, for example, reducing the R\'enyi DP parameter growth from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of training rounds. We validate our analysis with numerical results demonstrating superior DP bounds compared to existing approaches. We further illustrate our analysis with a logistic regression experiment on MNIST image classification in a fully decentralized setting, demonstrating utility comparable to central aggregation methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Task-Oriented Low-Label Semantic Communication With Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19940v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-oriented semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by conveying semantic information rather than exact messages. Deep learning (DL)-based semantic communication can effectively cultivate the essential semantic knowledge for semantic extraction, transmission, and interpretation by leveraging massive labeled samples for downstream task training. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning-based semantic communication framework (SLSCom) to enhance task inference performance, particularly in scenarios with limited access to labeled samples. Specifically, we develop a task-relevant semantic encoder using unlabeled samples, which can be collected by devices in real-world edge networks. To facilitate task-relevant semantic extraction, we introduce self-supervision for learning contrastive features and formulate the information bottleneck (IB) problem to balance the tradeoff between the informativeness of the extracted features and task inference performance. Given the computational challenges of the IB problem, we devise a practical and effective solution by employing self-supervised classification and reconstruction pretext tasks. We further propose efficient joint training methods to enhance end-to-end inference accuracy over wireless channels, even with few labeled samples. We evaluate the proposed framework on image classification tasks over multipath wireless channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that SLSCom significantly outperforms conventional digital coding methods and existing DL-based approaches across varying labeled data set sizes and SNR conditions, even when the unlabeled samples are irrelevant to the downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

These models have shown consistently improved results with the introduction of new methods. It is crucial to analyze how these trends impact the medical field and determine whether these advancements can drive meaningful change. This study investigates the application of recent state-of-the-art foundation models, DINOv2, MAE, VMamba, CoCa, SAM2, and AIMv2, for medical image classification. We explore their effectiveness on datasets including CBIS-DDSM for mammography, ISIC2019 for skin lesions, APTOS2019 for diabetic retinopathy, and CHEXPERT for chest radiographs. By fine-tuning these models and evaluating their configurations, we aim to understand the potential of these advancements in medical image classification. The results indicate that these advanced models significantly enhance classification outcomes, demonstrating robust performance despite limited labeled data. Based on our results, AIMv2, DINOv2, and SAM2 models outperformed others, demonstrating that progress in natural domain training has positively impacted the medical domain and improved classification outcomes.

However, the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity gives rise to inconsistent representations and divergent optimization dynamics across clients, ultimately hindering robust global performance. To transcend these challenges, we propose Mosaic, a novel data-free knowledge distillation framework tailored for heterogeneous distributed environments. Mosaic first trains local generative models to approximate each client's personalized distribution, enabling synthetic data generation that safeguards privacy through strict separation from real data. Subsequently, Mosaic forms a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) from client models based on their specialized knowledge, and distills it into a global model using the generated data. To further enhance the MoE architecture, Mosaic integrates expert predictions via a lightweight meta model trained on a few representative prototypes. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that Mosaic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model and data heterogeneity.

We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often overfit to seen data, leading to significant performance degradation when generalizing to novel classes or unseen domains. To address this limitation, we propose DiSa, a Directional Saliency-Aware Prompt Learning framework that integrates two complementary regularization strategies to enhance generalization. First, our Cross-Interactive Regularization (CIR) fosters cross-modal alignment by enabling cooperative learning between prompted and frozen encoders. Within CIR, a saliency-aware masking strategy guides the image encoder to prioritize semantically critical image regions, reducing reliance on less informative patches. Second, we introduce a directional regularization strategy that aligns visual embeddings with class-wise prototype features in a directional manner to prioritize consistency in feature orientation over strict proximity. This approach ensures robust generalization by leveraging stable prototype directions derived from class-mean statistics. Extensive evaluations on 11 diverse image classification benchmarks demonstrate that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, and few-shot learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2025)</p></details> | None |

While existing approaches like domain adaptation and test-time training (TTT) offer partial solutions, they typically require additional data or domain-specific auxiliary tasks. We present Idempotent Test-Time Training (IT$^3$), a novel approach that enables on-the-fly adaptation to distribution shifts using only the current test instance, without any auxiliary task design. Our key insight is that enforcing idempotence -- where repeated applications of a function yield the same result -- can effectively replace domain-specific auxiliary tasks used in previous TTT methods. We theoretically connect idempotence to prediction confidence and demonstrate that minimizing the distance between successive applications of our model during inference leads to improved out-of-distribution performance. Extensive experiments across diverse domains (including image classification, aerodynamics prediction, and aerial segmentation) and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) show that IT$^3$ consistently outperforms existing approaches while being simpler and more widely applicable. Our results suggest that idempotence provides a universal principle for test-time adaptation that generalizes across domains and architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Remote Sensing Image Classification with Decoupled Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19111v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the challenges posed by the large number of parameters in existing remote sensing image classification models, which hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a lightweight classification method based on knowledge distillation. Specifically, G-GhostNet is adopted as the backbone network, leveraging feature reuse to reduce redundant parameters and significantly improve inference efficiency. In addition, a decoupled knowledge distillation strategy is employed, which separates target and non-target classes to effectively enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on the RSOD and AID datasets demonstrate that, compared with the high-parameter VGG-16 model, the proposed method achieves nearly equivalent Top-1 accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by 6.24 times. This approach strikes an excellent balance between model size and classification performance, offering an efficient solution for deployment on resource-limited devices.</p></details> | 7 | None |
| **[Pre-trained Encoder Inference: Revealing Upstream Encoders In Downstream Machine Learning Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02814v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained encoders available online have been widely adopted to build downstream machine learning (ML) services, but various attacks against these encoders also post security and privacy threats toward such a downstream ML service paradigm. We unveil a new vulnerability: the Pre-trained Encoder Inference (PEI) attack, which can extract sensitive encoder information from a targeted downstream ML service that can then be used to promote other ML attacks against the targeted service. By only providing API accesses to a targeted downstream service and a set of candidate encoders, the PEI attack can successfully infer which encoder is secretly used by the targeted service based on candidate ones. Compared with existing encoder attacks, which mainly target encoders on the upstream side, the PEI attack can compromise encoders even after they have been deployed and hidden in downstream ML services, which makes it a more realistic threat. We empirically verify the effectiveness of the PEI attack on vision encoders. we first conduct PEI attacks against two downstream services (i.e., image classification and multimodal generation), and then show how PEI attacks can facilitate other ML attacks (i.e., model stealing attacks vs. image classification models and adversarial attacks vs. multimodal generative models). Our results call for new security and privacy considerations when deploying encoders in downstream services.

| **[SCHEME: Scalable Channel Mixer for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00412v4)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers have achieved impressive performance in many vision tasks. While the token mixer or attention block has been studied in great detail, much less research has been devoted to the channel mixer or feature mixing block (FFN or MLP), which accounts for a significant portion of the model parameters and computation. In this work, we show that the dense MLP connections can be replaced with a sparse block diagonal MLP structure that supports larger expansion ratios by splitting MLP features into groups. To improve the feature clusters formed by this structure we propose the use of a lightweight, parameter-free, channel covariance attention (CCA) mechanism as a parallel branch during training. This enables gradual feature mixing across channel groups during training whose contribution decays to zero as the training progresses to convergence. As a result, the CCA block can be discarded during inference, enabling enhanced performance at no additional computational cost. The resulting $\textit{Scalable CHannEl MixEr}$ (SCHEME) can be plugged into any ViT architecture to obtain a gamut of models with different trade-offs between complexity and performance by controlling the block diagonal MLP structure. This is shown by the introduction of a new family of SCHEMEformer models. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, with $\textbf{12 different ViT backbones}$, consistently demonstrate substantial accuracy/latency gains (upto $\textbf{1.5\% /20\%})$ over existing designs, especially for lower complexity regimes. The SCHEMEformer family is shown to establish new Pareto frontiers for accuracy vs FLOPS, accuracy vs model size, and accuracy vs throughput, especially for fast transformers of small size.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods aim to address these biases by mitigating sensitive attributes in image data; however, these attributes often carry clinically relevant information, and their removal can compromise model performance-a highly undesirable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Re-fusion After Disentanglement (FairREAD), a novel, simple, and efficient framework that mitigates unfairness by re-integrating sensitive demographic attributes into fair image representations. FairREAD employs orthogonality constraints and adversarial training to disentangle demographic information while using a controlled re-fusion mechanism to preserve clinically relevant details. Additionally, subgroup-specific threshold adjustments ensure equitable performance across demographic groups. Comprehensive evaluations on a large-scale clinical X-ray dataset demonstrate that FairREAD significantly reduces unfairness metrics while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for fairness and performance in medical image classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to Medical Image Analysis, Elsevier for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Similarly, medical images in universal lesion detection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing attributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage training images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep models. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum learning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by reweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods still confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is imprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there exists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified hard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch sampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely unexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We discover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during training; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS) method to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS introduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to surpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of high-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under represented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented samples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the negative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order minibatch sampling design.</p></details> | 16 pages,8 figures | None |

This cancer caused 670,000 deaths globally in 2022, as reported by the WHO. Yet since health officials began routine mammography screening in age groups deemed at risk in the 1980s, breast cancer mortality has decreased by 40% in high-income nations. Every day, a greater and greater number of people are receiving a breast cancer diagnosis. Reducing cancer-related deaths requires early detection and treatment. This paper compares two convolutional neural networks called ConvNeXT and EfficientNet to predict the likelihood of cancer in mammograms from screening exams. Preprocessing of the images, classification, and performance evaluation are main parts of the whole procedure. Several evaluation metrics were used to compare and evaluate the performance of the models. The result shows that ConvNeXT generates better results with a 94.33% AUC score, 93.36% accuracy, and 95.13% F-score compared to EfficientNet with a 92.34% AUC score, 91.47% accuracy, and 93.06% F-score on RSNA screening mammography breast cancer dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Asymmetric Duos: Sidekicks Improve Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18636v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The go-to strategy to apply deep networks in settings where uncertainty informs decisions--ensembling multiple training runs with random initializations--is ill-suited for the extremely large-scale models and practical fine-tuning workflows of today. We introduce a new cost-effective strategy for improving the uncertainty quantification and downstream decisions of a large model (e.g. a fine-tuned ViT-B): coupling it with a less accurate but much smaller "sidekick" (e.g. a fine-tuned ResNet-34) with a fraction of the computational cost. We propose aggregating the predictions of this \emph{Asymmetric Duo} by simple learned weighted averaging. Surprisingly, despite their inherent asymmetry, the sidekick model almost never harms the performance of the larger model. In fact, across five image classification benchmarks and a variety of model architectures and training schemes (including soups), Asymmetric Duos significantly improve accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and selective classification metrics with only ${\sim}10-20\%$ more computation.</p></details> | 24 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[CacheFL: Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Federated Cache Model Fine-Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05130v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have exhibited remarkable zero-shot performance across various image classification tasks. Fine-tuning these models on domain-specific datasets further enhances their effectiveness for downstream applications. However, fine-tuning in cloud environments raises significant concerns regarding data security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution by enabling model training across local clients without centralizing sensitive data, but the high communication and computation costs of transmitting full pre-trained models during training limit its scalability. Additionally, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across local clients can negatively impact model convergence and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CacheFL, a novel federated learning method that replaces traditional full model fine-tuning with lightweight cache model fine-tuning. The cache model is initialized using a class-balanced dataset generated by a generative pre-trained model, effectively mitigating the impact of non-IID data. This cache model is then distributed to local clients for fine-tuning, and the updated parameters from each client are aggregated on the server and redistributed. With the updated cache model, the classification performance of CLIP is improved after just a few epochs. By limiting the training and communication to the cache model, CacheFL significantly reduces resource demands while ensuring data privacy and security. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and 10 additional datasets demonstrate that CacheFL outperforms traditional approaches in terms of classification accuracy, resource efficiency, and privacy preservation.</p></details> |  | None |

CoLoRA can be seen as a natural extension of the convolutional architectures of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by developing and evaluating models using the widely adopted CNN backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. We observed that this strategy results in a stable and accurate coarse-tuning procedure. Moreover, this strategy is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the number of parameters required for fine-tuning compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, our method substantially improves the speed and stability of training. Our case study focuses on classifying retinal diseases from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, specifically using the OCTMNIST dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN backbone fine-tuned with CoLoRA surpasses nearly 1\% in accuracy. Such a performance is comparable to the Vision Transformer, State-space discrete, and Kolmogorov-Arnold network models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Feature Preserving Shrinkage on Bayesian Neural Networks via the R2D2 Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18280v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) treat neural network weights as random variables, which aim to provide posterior uncertainty estimates and avoid overfitting by performing inference on the posterior weights. However, the selection of appropriate prior distributions remains a challenging task, and BNNs may suffer from catastrophic inflated variance or poor predictive performance when poor choices are made for the priors. Existing BNN designs apply different priors to weights, while the behaviours of these priors make it difficult to sufficiently shrink noisy signals or they are prone to overshrinking important signals in the weights. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel R2D2-Net, which imposes the R^2-induced Dirichlet Decomposition (R2D2) prior to the BNN weights. The R2D2-Net can effectively shrink irrelevant coefficients towards zero, while preventing key features from over-shrinkage. To approximate the posterior distribution of weights more accurately, we further propose a variational Gibbs inference algorithm that combines the Gibbs updating procedure and gradient-based optimization. This strategy enhances stability and consistency in estimation when the variational objective involving the shrinkage parameters is non-convex. We also analyze the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and the posterior concentration rates from a theoretical perspective. Experiments on both natural and medical image classification and uncertainty estimation tasks demonstrate satisfactory performance of our method.</p></details> | To appear in TPAMI | None |

Yet, real-world applications in safety-critical domains involve a broader set of semantic tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, which come with a diverse set of dedicated model architectures. To facilitate research towards robust model design in segmentation and detection, our primary objective is to provide benchmarking tools regarding robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial manipulations. We propose the benchmarking tools SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH, along with the most extensive evaluation to date on the reliability and generalization of semantic segmentation and object detection models. In particular, we benchmark 76 segmentation models across four datasets and 61 object detectors across two datasets, evaluating their performance under diverse adversarial attacks and common corruptions. Our findings reveal systematic weaknesses in state-of-the-art models and uncover key trends based on architecture, backbone, and model capacity.

This paper introduces KITINet (Kinetics Theory Inspired Network), a novel architecture that reinterprets feature propagation through the lens of non-equilibrium particle dynamics and partial differential equation (PDE) simulation. At its core, we propose a residual module that models feature updates as the stochastic evolution of a particle system, numerically simulated via a discretized solver for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). This formulation mimics particle collisions and energy exchange, enabling adaptive feature refinement via physics-informed interactions. Additionally, we reveal that this mechanism induces network parameter condensation during training, where parameters progressively concentrate into a sparse subset of dominant channels. Experiments on scientific computation (PDE operator), image classification (CIFAR-10/100), and text classification (IMDb/SNLI) show consistent improvements over classic network baselines, with negligible increase of FLOPs.</p></details> |  | None |

The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of our paper accepted at IJCAI2025, with detailed proofs and additional experimental results</p></details> | None |

We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control parameters.

This paper introduces EVM-Fusion, an Explainable Vision Mamba architecture featuring a novel Neural Algorithmic Fusion (NAF) mechanism for multi-organ medical image classification. EVM-Fusion leverages a multipath design, where DenseNet and U-Net based pathways, enhanced by Vision Mamba (Vim) modules, operate in parallel with a traditional feature pathway. These diverse features are dynamically integrated via a two-stage fusion process: cross-modal attention followed by the iterative NAF block, which learns an adaptive fusion algorithm. Intrinsic explainability is embedded through path-specific spatial attention, Vim {\Delta}-value maps, traditional feature SE-attention, and cross-modal attention weights. Experiments on a diverse 9-class multi-organ medical image dataset demonstrate EVM-Fusion's strong classification performance, achieving 99.75% test accuracy and provide multi-faceted insights into its decision-making process, highlighting its potential for trustworthy AI in medical diagnostics.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures | None |

While pruning methods have shown strong performance in image classification, their extension to more complex computer vision tasks, particularly object detection, remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present the first principled extension of classification pruning techniques to the object detection domain, to the best of our knowledge. We identify and address three key challenges that hinder this transition: the Object-Level Attribution Problem, the Scoring Strategy Problem, and the Image-Level Aggregation Problem. To overcome these, we propose tailored solutions, including a novel scoring method called Variance-based Prediction Score (VPS). VPS leverages both Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence scores to effectively identify informative training samples specific to detection tasks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms prior dataset pruning methods in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). We also show that annotation count and class distribution shift can influence detection performance, but selecting informative examples is a more critical factor than dataset size or balance. Our work bridges dataset pruning and object detection, paving the way for dataset pruning in complex vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Based on linearized training dynamics, we bound the effect of such perturbation, resulting in an uncertainty score computable by perturbing model parameters. Ultimately, our approach computes uncertainty from a set of sampled predictions. We visualize our bound on synthetic regression and classification datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TULiP using large-scale OOD detection benchmarks for image classification.

In this study, we investigate the utility of a dermatology-specific foundation model, PanDerm, in comparison with two Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures (ViT base and Swin Transformer V2 base) for the task of skin lesion classification. Using frozen features extracted from PanDerm, we apply non-linear probing with three different classifiers, namely, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, and TabNet. For the ViT-based models, we perform full fine-tuning to optimize classification performance. Our experiments on the HAM10000 and MSKCC datasets demonstrate that the PanDerm-based MLP model performs comparably to the fine-tuned Swin transformer model, while fusion of PanDerm and Swin Transformer predictions leads to further performance improvements.

In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70\% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper contains 11 pages, 7 figures and 3 tables.

Given the limitations of existing classification methods in handling the complexity and variability of CGI, this research proposes a Swin Transformer based model for accurate differentiation between natural and synthetic images. The proposed model leverages the Swin Transformer's hierarchical architecture to capture local and global features for distinguishing CGI from natural images. Its performance was assessed through intra- and inter-dataset testing across three datasets: CiFAKE, JSSSTU, and Columbia. The model was evaluated individually on each dataset (D1, D2, D3) and on the combined datasets (D1+D2+D3) to test its robustness and domain generalization. To address dataset imbalance, data augmentation techniques were applied. Additionally, t-SNE visualization was used to demonstrate the feature separability achieved by the Swin Transformer across the selected color spaces. The model's performance was tested across all color schemes, with the RGB color scheme yielding the highest accuracy for each dataset. As a result, RGB was selected for domain generalization analysis and compared with other CNN-based models, VGG-19 and ResNet-50. The comparative results demonstrate the proposed model's effectiveness in detecting CGI, highlighting its robustness and reliability in both intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluations. The findings of this study highlight the Swin Transformer model's potential as an advanced tool for digital image forensics, particularly in distinguishing CGI from natural images. The model's strong performance indicates its capability for domain generalization, making it a valuable asset in scenarios requiring precise and reliable image classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.04734</p></details> | None |

However, despite the cleaning efforts, these datasets still suffer from pervasive noisy labels and often contain missing labels due to the co-existing image pattern where multiple classes appear in an image sample. This results in misleading model comparisons and unfair evaluations. Existing label cleaning methods focus primarily on noisy labels, but the issue of missing labels remains largely overlooked. Motivated by these challenges, we present a comprehensive framework named REVEAL, integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., LLaVA, BLIP, Janus, Qwen) with advanced machine/human label curation methods (e.g., Docta, Cleanlab, MTurk), to systematically address both noisy labels and missing label detection in widely-used image classification test sets. REVEAL detects potential noisy labels and omissions, aggregates predictions from various methods, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed predictions and consensus-based filtering. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained image classifiers, highlighting their strengths and limitations within the context of dataset renovation by revealing 10 observations. Our method effectively reveals missing labels from public datasets and provides soft-labeled results with likelihoods. Through human verifications, REVEAL significantly improves the quality of 6 benchmark test sets, highly aligning to human judgments and enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

GradPCA applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to gradient class-means, achieving more consistent performance than existing methods across standard image classification benchmarks. We provide a theoretical perspective on spectral OOD detection in neural networks to support GradPCA, highlighting feature-space properties that enable effective detection and naturally emerge from NTK alignment. Our analysis further reveals that feature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained representations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will succeed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and our theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled spectral OOD detectors.</p></details> |  | None |

Conformal prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. However, conformal prediction results face challenges due to the backbone model's struggles in domain-shifted scenarios, such as variations in different sources. To aim this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework termed Conformal Ensemble of Vision Transformers (CE-ViTs) designed to enhance image classification performance by prioritizing domain adaptation and model robustness, while accounting for uncertainty. The proposed method leverages an ensemble of vision transformer models in the backbone, trained on diverse datasets including HAM10000, Dermofit, and Skin Cancer ISIC datasets. This ensemble learning approach, calibrated through the combined mentioned datasets, aims to enhance domain adaptation through conformal learning. Experimental results underscore that the framework achieves a high coverage rate of 90.38\%, representing an improvement of 9.95\% compared to the HAM10000 model.

Many deep learning algorithms rely on weight decay, dropout, batch/layer normalization to converge faster and generalize. Label Smoothing (LS) is another simple, versatile and efficient regularization which can be applied to various supervised classification tasks. Conventional LS, however, regardless of the training instance assumes that each non-target class is equally likely. In this work, we present a general framework for training with label regularization, which includes conventional LS but can also model instance-specific variants. Based on this formulation, we propose an efficient way of learning LAbel regularization by devising a Bi-level Optimization (LABO) problem. We derive a deterministic and interpretable solution of the inner loop as the optimal label smoothing without the need to store the parameters or the output of a trained model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate our LABO consistently yields improvement over conventional label regularization on various fields, including seven machine translation and three image classification tasks across various</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL2023 (Findings)</p></details> | None |

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the right-skewed asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix; v2: slight improvement in presentation.

However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3) No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets, significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.</p></details> | 14pages,15 figures | None |

The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured, whereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less studied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of capture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model performance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common vision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\textbf{S}$hutter speed, ISO se$\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of objects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled camera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show the effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we conduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our results show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models trained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed images, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute variations of camera settings.

| **[Aligning Explanations with Human Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15626v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning explainability aims to make the decision-making process of black-box models more transparent by finding the most important input features for a given prediction task. Recent works have proposed composing explanations from semantic concepts (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) that are inherently interpretable to the user of a model. However, these methods generally ignore the communicative context of explanation-the ability of the user to understand the prediction of the model from the explanation. For example, while a medical doctor might understand an explanation in terms of clinical markers, a patient may need a more accessible explanation to make sense of the same diagnosis. In this paper, we address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations. We propose an iterative procedure grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the rational speech act to generate explanations that maximize communicative utility. Our procedure only needs access to pairwise preferences between candidate explanations, relevant in real-world scenarios where a listener model may not be available. We evaluate our method in image classification tasks, demonstrating improved alignment between explanations and listener preferences across three datasets. Furthermore, we perform a user study that demonstrates our explanations increase communicative utility.</p></details> |  | None |

To mitigate this, we introduce BiSSL, a novel bilevel training framework that enhances the alignment of self-supervised pretrained models with downstream tasks prior to fine-tuning. BiSSL acts as an intermediate training stage conducted after conventional self-supervised pretraining and is tasked with solving a bilevel optimization problem that incorporates the pretext and downstream training objectives in its lower- and upper-level objectives, respectively. This approach explicitly models the interdependence between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages within the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline, facilitating enhanced information sharing between them that ultimately leads to a model initialization better aligned with the downstream task. We propose a general training algorithm for BiSSL that is compatible with a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pretrain ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves accuracy on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Exploratory analyses alongside investigative experiments further provide compelling evidence that BiSSL enhances downstream alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters and no architectural changes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these sets do not provide probability estimates for individual labels, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method for assigning calibrated probabilities to elements of a conformal prediction set. Our approach frames this as an adaptive calibration problem, selecting an input-specific temperature parameter to match the desired coverage level. Experiments on several challenging image classification datasets demonstrate that our method maintains coverage guarantees while significantly reducing expected calibration error.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most RS foundation models are designed for multispectral data, while hyperspectral imagery (HSI) - with its hundreds of spectral bands - remains less explored. Fine-tuning such models for downstream tasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a multispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). We explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank Kronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for low-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce KronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We evaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning (FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral foundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the training epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar performance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds only approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT method tested.</p></details> | 33 pages, 14 figures | None |

The most common fine-tuning method is to update pretrained weights via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Existing initialization strategies for LoRA often rely on singular value decompositions (SVD) of gradients or weight matrices. However, they do not provably maximize the expected gradient signal, which is critical for fast adaptation. To this end, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme that uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably maximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA performs incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the right-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by selecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given rank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of trainable parameters, while maintaining or improving downstream performance. We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as language generation and understanding, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + references and appendix, code available at https://github.com/ml-jku/EVA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ml-jku/EVA) |

Among them, Copy-Paste is a simple yet effective method and gain great attention recently. However, existing Copy-Paste often overlook contextual relevance between source and target images, resulting in inconsistencies in generated outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a context-aware approach that integrates Bidirectional Latent Information Propagation (BLIP) for content extraction from source images. By matching extracted content information with category information, our method ensures cohesive integration of target objects using Segment Anything Model (SAM) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). This approach eliminates the need for manual annotation, offering an automated and user-friendly solution. Experimental evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing data diversity and generating high-quality pseudo-images across various computer vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

We view images as the vertices in a weighted graph and the similarity between a pair of images as the edges in the graph. The vertices within the same cluster can be assumed to share similar features and properties, thus making the applications of graph clustering techniques very useful for image classification. Recently, the approach based on the sparse solutions of linear systems for graph clustering has been found to identify clusters more efficiently than traditional clustering methods such as spectral clustering. We propose to use the two newly developed local clustering methods based on sparse solution of linear system for image classification. In addition, we employ a box spline-based tight-wavelet-framelet method to clean these images and help build a better adjacency matrix before clustering. The performance of our methods is shown to be very effective in classifying images. Our approach is significantly more efficient and either favorable or equally effective compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we shall make a remark by pointing out two image deformation methods to build up more artificial image data to increase the number of labeled images.</p></details> |  | None |

Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains comparable.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision foundation models have been adopted to enhance radiologic imaging analysis. However, the distinct complexities of radiologic 2D and 3D radiologic data pose unique challenges that existing models, pre-trained on general non-medical images, fail to address adequately. To bridge this gap and capitalize on the diagnostic precision required in radiologic imaging, we introduce Radiologic Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (RadCLIP): a cross-modal vision-language foundational model that harnesses Vision Language Pre-training (VLP) framework to improve radiologic image analysis. Building upon Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), RadCLIP incorporates a slice pooling mechanism tailored for volumetric image analysis and is pre-trained using a large and diverse dataset of radiologic image-text pairs. The RadCLIP was pre-trained to effectively align radiologic images with their corresponding text annotations, creating a robust vision backbone for radiologic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate RadCLIP's superior performance in both uni-modal radiologic image classification and cross-modal image-text matching, highlighting its significant promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings. Our Key contributions include curating a large dataset with diverse radiologic 2D/3D radiologic image-text pairs, a slice pooling adapter using an attention mechanism for integrating 2D images, and comprehensive evaluations of RadCLIP on various radiologic downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent efforts have explored adversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional discriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the discrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein, we address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly derived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target predictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component. Subsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate an adversarial loss using the Fr\'echet distance. The proposed framework is therefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids the expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method. The proposed method is evaluated on several multi-label image datasets covering three different types of domain shift. The obtained results demonstrate that DDA-MLIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision while requiring a lower number of parameters.

Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose \underline{G}reat L\underline{o}R\underline{A} Mixture-of-Exper\underline{t} (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance. Experiments across 25 datasets, including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, image classification, and natural language generation, demonstrate GOAT's state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> | None |

However, conventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks, which introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage requirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an appropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free distillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many existing approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex training procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on teacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without any auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable parameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective augmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation simulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs of intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying instance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions. Our method is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement, requiring only a single augmentation function. Extensive experiments across image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection show that our method consistently outperforms both existing self-distillation baselines and conventional teacher-based KD approaches. These results suggest that the success of self-distillation could hinge on the design of the augmentation itself.

To achieve more robust and balanced generalization, methods applying sharpness-aware minimization to a subset of worst-case examples have proven successful for image classification tasks, but only using overparameterized neural networks under which the relative difference between "easy" and "hard" data points becomes negligible. In this work, we show how such a strategy can dramatically break down under simpler models where the difficulty gap becomes more extreme. As a more flexible alternative, instead of typical sharpness, we propose and evaluate a training criterion which penalizes poor loss concentration, which can be easily combined with loss transformations such exponential tilting, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), or distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that control tail emphasis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.</p></details> | Work in progressing | None |

While these models offer active interpretability, they often suffer from concept leakages, where unintended information within soft concept representations undermines both interpretability and generalizability.

To address these limitations, we propose Concept Rule Learner (CRL), a novel framework to learn Boolean logical rules from binarized visual concepts. CRL employs logical layers to capture concept correlations and extract clinically meaningful rules, thereby providing both local and global interpretability.

While metrics such as unlearning accuracy (UA) and membership inference attack (MIA) provide baselines for assessing unlearning performance, they fall short of evaluating the forgetting reliability. In this paper, we find that the data misclassified across UA and MIA still have their ground truth labels included in the prediction set from the uncertainty quantification perspective, which raises a fake unlearning issue. To address this issue, we propose two novel metrics inspired by conformal prediction that more reliably evaluate forgetting quality. Building on these insights, we further propose a conformal prediction-based unlearning framework that integrates conformal prediction into Carlini & Wagner adversarial attack loss, which can significantly push the ground truth label out of the conformal prediction set. Through extensive experiments on image classification task, we demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and the superiority of our unlearning framework, which improves the UA of existing unlearning methods by an average of 6.6% through the incorporation of a tailored loss term alone.</p></details> |  | None |

Although SSMs are not suitable for handling non-causal data, Vision Mamba (ViM) methods still demonstrate good performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection. Recent studies have shown that there is a rich theoretical connection between state space models and attention variants. We propose a novel separable self attention method, for the first time introducing some excellent design concepts of Mamba into separable self-attention.

| **[Adversarial Attacks on Data Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05657v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data attribution aims to quantify the contribution of individual training data points to the outputs of an AI model, which has been used to measure the value of training data and compensate data providers. Given the impact on financial decisions and compensation mechanisms, a critical question arises concerning the adversarial robustness of data attribution methods. However, there has been little to no systematic research addressing this issue. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by detailing a threat model with clear assumptions about the adversary's goal and capabilities and proposing principled adversarial attack methods on data attribution. We present two methods, Shadow Attack and Outlier Attack, which generate manipulated datasets to inflate the compensation adversarially. The Shadow Attack leverages knowledge about the data distribution in the AI applications, and derives adversarial perturbations through "shadow training", a technique commonly used in membership inference attacks. In contrast, the Outlier Attack does not assume any knowledge about the data distribution and relies solely on black-box queries to the target model's predictions. It exploits an inductive bias present in many data attribution methods - outlier data points are more likely to be influential - and employs adversarial examples to generate manipulated datasets. Empirically, in image classification and text generation tasks, the Shadow Attack can inflate the data-attribution-based compensation by at least 200%, while the Outlier Attack achieves compensation inflation ranging from 185% to as much as 643%.

| **[Synthetic-Powered Predictive Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13432v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification and tabular regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, the Pretrain-Finetuning paradigm has garnered significant attention in recent years, and exploiting pre-trained models could also reduce the requirement of labeled data in downstream tasks. Therefore, a question naturally occurs: \emph{When the labeled data is scarce in the target tasks, should we exploit unlabeled data or pre-trained models?} To answer this question, we select pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as representative pretrain-finetuning instances and propose \textit{Few-shot SSL} -- a framework that enables fair comparison between these two paradigms by controlling the amount of labeled data used. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that pre-trained VLMs generally outperform SSL methods in nearly all cases, except when the data has low resolution or lacks clear semantic structure. Therefore, we encourage future SSL research to compare with pre-trained models and explore deeper integration, such as using pre-trained knowledge to enhance pseudo-labeling. To support future research, we release our unified reproduction and evaluation framework.

Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.</p></details> | <details><summary>L.

| **[Emergence of Fixational and Saccadic Movements in a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model for Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13191v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by foveal vision, hard attention models promise interpretability and parameter economy. However, existing models like the Recurrent Model of Visual Attention (RAM) and Deep Recurrent Attention Model (DRAM) failed to model the hierarchy of human vision system, that compromise on the visual exploration dynamics. As a result, they tend to produce attention that are either overly fixational or excessively saccadic, diverging from human eye movement behavior. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model (MRAM), a novel hard attention framework that explicitly models the neural hierarchy of human visual processing. By decoupling the function of glimpse location generation and task execution in two recurrent layers, MRAM emergent a balanced behavior between fixation and saccadic movement. Our results show that MRAM not only achieves more human-like attention dynamics, but also consistently outperforms CNN, RAM and DRAM baselines on standard image classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

On the one hand, the camera position is arbitrary and objects can appear anywhere in the image, arguing for translation invariance. At the same time, position information is key for exploiting capture/center bias, and scene layout, e.g.: the sky is up. We show that position bias, the level to which a dataset is more easily solved when positional information on input features is used, plays a crucial role in the performance of Vision Transformers image classifiers. To investigate, we propose Position-SHAP, a direct measure of position bias by extending SHAP to work with position embeddings. We show various levels of position bias in different datasets, and find that the optimal choice of position embedding depends on the position bias apparent in the dataset. We therefore propose Auto-PE, a single-parameter position embedding extension, which allows the position embedding to modulate its norm, enabling the unlearning of position information. Auto-PE combines with existing PEs to match or improve accuracy on classification datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

We develop a formal framework for majority-minority learning tasks, showing how standard training can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between ``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and (iii) a lower bound on the additional training required. Our results are illustrated through experiments in deep learning for tabular and image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Toward Relative Positional Encoding in Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16745v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that mimic how neurons in the brain communicate through discrete spikes, which have great potential in various tasks due to their energy efficiency and temporal processing capabilities. SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks, and inspired by traditional Transformers, several studies have demonstrated that spiking absolute positional encoding can help capture sequential relationships for input data, enhancing the capabilities of spiking Transformers for tasks such as sequential modeling and image classification. However, how to incorporate relative positional information into SNNs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce several strategies to approximate relative positional encoding (RPE) in spiking Transformers while preserving the binary nature of spikes. Firstly, we formally prove that encoding relative distances with Gray Code ensures that the binary representations of positional indices maintain a constant Hamming distance whenever their decimal values differ by a power of two, and we propose Gray-PE based on this property. In addition, we propose another RPE method called Log-PE, which combines the logarithmic form of the relative distance matrix directly into the spiking attention map. Furthermore, we extend our RPE methods to a two-dimensional form, making them suitable for processing image patches. We evaluate our RPE methods on various tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification, and the experimental results demonstrate a satisfying performance gain by incorporating our RPE methods across many architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they usually apply single receptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different feature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in medical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing diverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and salient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical image classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often unfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical diagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept, Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields (ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and fairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by applying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different lesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple heterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like structural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the two-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed through comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and generalization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient CNN architectures. The extensive experiments show that our method maintains a better trade-off than state-of-the-art methods in terms of medical image classification, fairness, and computation overhead. The codes of this paper will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

Post-hoc approaches generate explanations for pre-trained models and are compatible with various neural network architectures. These methods often use feature importance visualizations, such as saliency maps, to indicate which input regions influenced the model's prediction. Unfortunately, they typically offer a coarse understanding of the model's decision-making process. In contrast, ante-hoc (inherently explainable) methods rely on specially designed model architectures trained from scratch. A notable subclass of these methods provides explanations through prototypes, representative patches extracted from the training data. However, prototype-based approaches have limitations: they require dedicated architectures, involve specialized training procedures, and perform well only on specific datasets. In this work, we propose EPIC (Explanation of Pretrained Image Classification), a novel approach that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Like post-hoc methods, EPIC operates on pre-trained models without architectural modifications. Simultaneously, it delivers intuitive, prototype-based explanations inspired by ante-hoc techniques. To the best of our knowledge, EPIC is the first post-hoc method capable of fully replicating the core explanatory power of inherently interpretable models. We evaluate EPIC on benchmark datasets commonly used in prototype-based explanations, such as CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars, alongside large-scale datasets like ImageNet, typically employed by post-hoc methods. EPIC uses prototypes to explain model decisions, providing a flexible and easy-to-understand tool for creating clear, high-quality explanations.</p></details> |  | None |

The unlabeled server dataset can either be pre-existing or generated through a data-free approach. The effectiveness of this approach critically depends on the method of assigning weights to client predictions when creating pseudo-labels, especially in highly heterogeneous settings. Inspired by theoretical results from GANs, we propose a provably near-optimal weighting method that leverages client discriminators trained with a server-distributed generator and local datasets. Our experiments on various image classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, we show that the additional communication cost, client-side privacy leakage, and client-side computational overhead introduced by our method are negligible, both in scenarios with and without a pre-existing server dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Poster) at ICML 2025</p></details> | None |

At the core of their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

In image classification tasks, it is common to use data augmentation strategies to increase the robustness of trained networks to changes in the input images and to avoid overfitting. Although data augmentation is a widely adopted technique, the literature lacks a body of research analyzing the effects data augmentation methods have on the patterns learned by neural network models working on complex datasets. The primary objective of this work is to propose a methodology and set of metrics that may allow a quantitative approach to analyzing the effects of data augmentation in convolutional networks applied to image classification. An important tool used in the proposed approach lies in the concept of class activation maps for said models, which allow us to identify and measure the importance these models assign to each individual pixel in an image when executing the classification task. From these maps, we may then extract metrics over the similarities and differences between maps generated by these models trained on a given dataset with different data augmentation strategies. Experiments made using this methodology suggest that the effects of these data augmentation techniques not only can be analyzed in this way but also allow us to identify different impact profiles over the trained models.</p></details> |  | None |

The expanding variety of Pre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for specific tasks. To better reuse the VLM resource and fully leverage its potential on different zero-shot image classification tasks, a promising strategy is selecting appropriate Pre-Trained VLMs from the VLM Zoo, relying solely on the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images. In this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a VLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the "Modality Gap" - the disparity in VLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable substitute for images; and the "Capability Gap" - the discrepancy between the VLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct prediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general performance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the negative impact of two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to capture the relevance between open-source and target datasets with a transportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics of VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging two gaps. By bridging two gaps to obtain better substitutes for test images, SWAB can accurately predict the performance ranking of different VLMs on the target task without the need for the dataset's images. Experiments across various VLMs and image classification datasets validate SWAB's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix typo in figure 2 "Capability Gap"</p></details> | None |

Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently, homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning (MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel, FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Wenchen-Chen/S4L-FSC</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Wenchen-Chen/S4L-FSC) |

While efficient, LoRA constrains updates to a fixed low-rank subspace (Delta W = BA), which can limit representational capacity and hinder downstream performance. We introduce Subspace Recomposition in Low-Rank Adaptation (SRLoRA) via importance-based fusion and reinitialization, a novel approach that enhances LoRA's expressiveness without compromising its lightweight structure. SRLoRA assigns importance scores to each LoRA pair (a column of B and the corresponding row of A), and dynamically recomposes the subspace during training. Less important pairs are fused into the frozen backbone, freeing capacity to reinitialize new pairs along unused principal directions derived from the pretrained weight's singular value decomposition. This mechanism enables continual subspace refreshment and richer adaptation over time, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. We evaluate SRLoRA on both language and vision tasks, including the GLUE benchmark and various image classification datasets. SRLoRA consistently achieves faster convergence and improved accuracy over standard LoRA, demonstrating its generality, efficiency, and potential for broader PEFT applications.</p></details> | Research report | None |

Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures | None |

While existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation, they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations.

However, the increasing scale and complexity of modern deep models often exceed the computational or memory capabilities of edge devices. Furthermore, clients may be constrained to use heterogeneous model architectures due to hardware variability (e.g., ASICs, FPGAs) or proprietary requirements that prevent the disclosure or modification of local model structures. These practical considerations motivate the need for model-heterogeneous FL, where clients participate using distinct model architectures. In this work, we propose Generative Model-Aided Federated Learning (GeFL), a framework that enables cross-client knowledge sharing via a generative model trained in a federated manner. This generative model captures global data semantics and facilitates local training without requiring model homogeneity across clients. While GeFL achieves strong performance, empirical analysis reveals limitations in scalability and potential privacy leakage due to generative sample memorization. To address these concerns, we propose GeFL-F, which utilizes feature-level generative modeling. This approach enhances scalability to large client populations and mitigates privacy risks. Extensive experiments across image classification tasks demonstrate that both GeFL and GeFL-F offer competitive performance in heterogeneous settings.

The reBEN dataset consists of 549,488 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct reBEN, we initially consider the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 tiles used to construct the BigEarthNet dataset and then divide them into patches of size 1200 m x 1200 m. We apply atmospheric correction to the Sentinel-2 patches using the latest version of the sen2cor tool, resulting in higher-quality patches compared to those present in BigEarthNet. Each patch is then associated with a pixel-level reference map and scene-level multi-labels. This makes reBEN suitable for pixel- and scene-based learning tasks. The labels are derived from the most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 by utilizing the 19-class nomenclature as in BigEarthNet. The use of the most recent CLC map results in overcoming the label noise present in BigEarthNet. Furthermore, we introduce a new geographical-based split assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the spatial correlation among the train, validation, and test sets with respect to those present in BigEarthNet. This increases the reliability of the evaluation of DL models. To minimize the DL model training time, we introduce software tools that convert the reBEN dataset into a DL-optimized data format. In our experiments, we show the potential of reBEN for multi-modal multi-label image classification problems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models.

This framework improves the performance of existing Transformer models while providing desirable theoretical guarantees, including generalization and robustness. Our framework is designed to be plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration with established Transformer models and requiring only slight changes to the implementation. We conduct seven extensive experiments on tasks motivated by text generation, sentiment analysis, image classification, and point cloud classification. Experimental results show that the framework improves the test performance of the baselines, while being more parameter-efficient. On character-level text generation with nanoGPT, our framework achieves a 46% reduction in final test loss while using 42% fewer parameters. On GPT-2, our framework achieves a 5.6% reduction in final test loss, demonstrating scalability to larger models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies optimal control theory to both the training and architecture of Transformers.

Due to the large volume of model updates required to be transmitted between clients and the central server, most FL systems are associated with high transfer costs (i.e., communication overhead). This issue is more critical for operational applications in remote sensing (RS), especially when large-scale RS data is processed and analyzed through FL systems with restricted communication bandwidth. To address this issue, we introduce an explanation-guided pruning strategy for communication-efficient FL in the context of RS image classification. Our pruning strategy is defined based on the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) driven explanations to: 1) efficiently and effectively identify the most relevant and informative model parameters (to be exchanged between clients and the central server); and 2) eliminate the non-informative ones to minimize the volume of model updates. The experimental results on the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset demonstrate that our strategy effectively reduces the number of shared model updates, while increasing the generalization ability of the global model.

In the paper, we are the first to propose in-model merging (InMerge), a novel approach that enhances the model's robustness by selectively merging similar convolutional kernels in the deep layers of a single convolutional neural network (CNN) during the training process for classification. We also analytically reveal important characteristics that affect how in-model merging should be performed, serving as an insightful reference for the community. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this technique for different CNN architectures on 4 prevalent datasets. The proposed InMerge-trained model surpasses the typically-trained model by a substantial margin. The code will be made public.</p></details> |  | None |

Most current methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which focus on local features while neglecting global features. Recently, self-attention mechanisms have been introduced into the field of computer vision, demonstrating superior performance. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective model, CheX-DS, for classifying long-tail multi-label data in the medical field of chest X-rays. The model is based on the excellent CNN model DenseNet for medical imaging and the newly popular Swin Transformer model, utilizing ensemble deep learning techniques to combine the two models and leverage the advantages of both CNNs and Transformers. The loss function of CheX-DS combines weighted binary cross-entropy loss with asymmetric loss, effectively addressing the issue of data imbalance. The NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset is selected to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The model outperforms previous studies with an excellent average AUC score of 83.76\%, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> | BIBM | None |
| **[Privacy-Aware Lifelong Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10941v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong learning algorithms enable models to incrementally acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Contrarily, the field of machine unlearning focuses on explicitly forgetting certain previous knowledge from pretrained models when requested, in order to comply with data privacy regulations on the right-to-be-forgotten. Enabling efficient lifelong learning with the capability to selectively unlearn sensitive information from models presents a critical and largely unaddressed challenge with contradicting objectives. We address this problem from the perspective of simultaneously preventing catastrophic forgetting and allowing forward knowledge transfer during task-incremental learning, while ensuring exact task unlearning and minimizing memory requirements, based on a single neural network model to be adapted. Our proposed solution, privacy-aware lifelong learning (PALL), involves optimization of task-specific sparse subnetworks with parameter sharing within a single architecture. We additionally utilize an episodic memory rehearsal mechanism to facilitate exact unlearning without performance degradations. We empirically demonstrate the scalability of PALL across various architectures in image classification, and provide a state-of-the-art solution that uniquely integrates lifelong learning and privacy-aware unlearning mechanisms for responsible AI applications.</p></details> |  | None |

While one line of existing MU methods relies on linear parameter updates via task arithmetic, they suffer from weight entanglement. In this work, we propose a novel MU framework called Mode Connectivity Unlearning (MCU) that leverages mode connectivity to find an unlearning pathway in a nonlinear manner. To further enhance performance and efficiency, we introduce a parameter mask strategy that not only improves unlearning effectiveness but also reduces computational overhead. Moreover, we propose an adaptive adjustment strategy for our unlearning penalty coefficient to adaptively balance forgetting quality and predictive performance during training, eliminating the need for empirical hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional MU methods that identify only a single unlearning model, MCU uncovers a spectrum of unlearning models along the pathway. Overall, MCU serves as a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with any existing MU methods, consistently improving unlearning efficacy. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate that MCU achieves superior performance.</p></details> |  | None |

While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP outdo in multimodal representation, their capacity for AI-generated image classification is underexplored due to the absence of such labels during the pre-training process. This work investigates whether CLIP embeddings inherently contain information indicative of AI generation. A proposed pipeline extracts visual embeddings using a frozen CLIP model, feeds its embeddings to lightweight networks, and fine-tunes only the final classifier. Experiments on the public CIFAKE benchmark show the performance reaches 95% accuracy without language reasoning. Few-shot adaptation to curated custom with 20% of the data results in performance to 85%. A closed-source baseline (Gemini-2.0) has the best zero-shot accuracy yet fails on specific styles. Notably, some specific image types, such as wide-angle photographs and oil paintings, pose significant challenges to classification. These results indicate previously unexplored difficulties in classifying certain types of AI-generated images, revealing new and more specific questions in this domain that are worth further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, not submitted to any conference</p></details> | None |

Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its exact calculation is computationally and memory intensive, which hinders its scalability and applicability for large-scale problems. Various approximate EMD algorithms have been proposed to reduce computational costs, but they suffer lower accuracy and may require additional memory usage or manual parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a novel approach, NNS-EMD, to approximate EMD using Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS), in order to achieve high accuracy, low time complexity, and high memory efficiency. The NNS operation reduces the number of data points compared in each NNS iteration and offers opportunities for parallel processing. We further accelerate NNS-EMD via vectorization on GPU, which is especially beneficial for large datasets. We compare NNS-EMD with both the exact EMD and state-of-the-art approximate EMD algorithms on image classification and retrieval tasks. We also apply NNS-EMD to calculate transport mapping and realize color transfer between images. NNS-EMD can be 44x to 135x faster than the exact EMD implementation, and achieves superior accuracy, speedup, and memory efficiency over existing approximate EMD methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In data-scarce settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PrePrompt: Predictive prompting for class incremental learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08586v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) based on pre-trained models offers a promising direction for open-world continual learning. Existing methods typically rely on correlation-based strategies, where an image's classification feature is used as a query to retrieve the most related key prompts and select the corresponding value prompts for training. However, these approaches face an inherent limitation: fitting the entire feature space of all tasks with only a few trainable prompts is fundamentally challenging. We propose Predictive Prompting (PrePrompt), a novel CIL framework that circumvents correlation-based limitations by leveraging pre-trained models' natural classification ability to predict task-specific prompts. Specifically, PrePrompt decomposes CIL into a two-stage prediction framework: task-specific prompt prediction followed by label prediction. While theoretically appealing, this framework risks bias toward recent classes due to missing historical data for older classifier calibration. PrePrompt then mitigates this by incorporating feature translation, dynamically balancing stability and plasticity. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate PrePrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art prompt-based CIL methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 29 figures, conference</p></details> | None |

As in the traditional neural network, the convolutional layers form informational "features" used as predictors in the SNN-based classifier with CoLaNET architecture.

Our goal is to reduce inference latency and model complexity with acceptable accuracy degradation. Through systematic hyperparameter variations, we demonstrate that appropriately fine-tuned Vision Transformers can match or exceed the baseline's performance, achieve faster inference, and operate with fewer parameters, highlighting their viability for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Empowering Vision Transformers with Multi-Scale Causal Intervention for Long-Tailed Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08173v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate long-tail classification by handling the biases introduced by class imbalance. However, along with the change of advanced backbone models from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Visual Transformers (ViT), existing causal models may not achieve an expected performance gain. This paper investigates the influence of existing causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global feature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations between fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in classifying tail classes with similar visual appearance. To address these issues, this paper proposes TSCNet, a two-stage causal modeling method to discover fine-grained causal associations through multi-scale causal interventions. Specifically, in the hierarchical causal representation learning stage (HCRL), it decouples the background and objects, applying backdoor interventions at both the patch and feature level to prevent model from using class-irrelevant areas to infer labels which enhances fine-grained causal representation. In the counterfactual logits bias calibration stage (CLBC), it refines the optimization of model's decision boundary by adaptive constructing counterfactual balanced data distribution to remove the spurious associations in the logits caused by data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on various long-tail benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSCNet can eliminate multiple biases introduced by data imbalance, which outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MoKD: Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08170v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compact models can be effectively trained through Knowledge Distillation (KD), a technique that transfers knowledge from larger, high-performing teacher models. Two key challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD) are: 1) balancing learning from the teacher's guidance and the task objective, and 2) handling the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models. To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation (MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space, improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, MoKD models also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to models trained from scratch.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Sparse Attention Framework for Computationally Efficient Classification of Biological Cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07661v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SparseAttnNet, a new hierarchical attention-driven framework for efficient image classification that adaptively selects and processes only the most informative pixels from images. Traditional convolutional neural networks typically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading to computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our approach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention distilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model, allowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k is adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once the top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding them as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by multi-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images, we demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels instead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white blood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD) images from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from motion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield microscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities, SparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing computational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point operations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers. Since the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers improved explainability. The adaptive and lightweight nature of SparseAttnNet makes it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained and high-throughput settings, including imaging flow cytometry.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset generalization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking in RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking is crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT without thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate No-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types. Experimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or matches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may hinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate this effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to explore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an Adaptive-Thinking method. Experiments show that it converges to a specific prompt depending on model capability and task complexity, achieving comparable or better performance than both Thinking and No-Thinking-RL. This suggests MLLMs can adaptively decide to think or not based on their capabilities and task complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress.

Computer vision (CV) has become a popular solution for these inspections due to its cost-effectiveness and reliability.

To reduce the need for extensive training data, we propose a novel image classification pipeline that combines similarity search using a vision-based foundation model with synthetic data. Our approach leverages a DINOv2 model to transform input images into feature vectors, which are then compared to pre-classified reference images using cosine distance measurements. By utilizing synthetic data instead of real images as references, our pipeline achieves high classification accuracy without relying on real data. We evaluate this approach in eight real-world inspection scenarios and demonstrate that it meets the high performance requirements of production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Procedia CIRP</p></details> | None |
| **[Discovering Fine-Grained Visual-Concept Relations by Disentangled Optimal Transport Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07209v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) try to make the decision-making process transparent by exploring an intermediate concept space between the input image and the output prediction. Existing CBMs just learn coarse-grained relations between the whole image and the concepts, less considering local image information, leading to two main drawbacks: i) they often produce spurious visual-concept relations, hence decreasing model reliability; and ii) though CBMs could explain the importance of every concept to the final prediction, it is still challenging to tell which visual region produces the prediction. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Disentangled Optimal Transport CBM (DOT-CBM) framework to explore fine-grained visual-concept relations between local image patches and concepts. Specifically, we model the concept prediction process as a transportation problem between the patches and concepts, thereby achieving explicit fine-grained feature alignment. We also incorporate orthogonal projection losses within the modality to enhance local feature disentanglement. To further address the shortcut issues caused by statistical biases in the data, we utilize the visual saliency map and concept label statistics as transportation priors. Thus, DOT-CBM can visualize inversion heatmaps, provide more reliable concept predictions, and produce more accurate class predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DOT-CBM achieves SOTA performance on several tasks, including image classification, local part detection and out-of-distribution generalization.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000 image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant disease diagnostics.

Existing solutions fall short as they rely on untargeted random, model- or latent-based perturbations, due to difficulties in generating controlled input variations. In this work, we introduce Mimicry, a novel black-box test generator for fine-grained, targeted exploration of DL system boundaries. Mimicry performs boundary testing by leveraging the probabilistic nature of DL outputs to identify promising directions for exploration. It uses style-based GANs to disentangle input representations into content and style components, enabling controlled feature mixing to approximate the decision boundary. We evaluated Mimicry's effectiveness in generating boundary inputs for five widely used DL image classification systems of increasing complexity, comparing it to two baseline approaches. Our results show that Mimicry consistently identifies inputs closer to the decision boundary. It generates semantically meaningful boundary test cases that reveal new functional (mis)behaviors, while the baselines produce mainly corrupted or invalid inputs. Thanks to its enhanced control over latent space manipulations, Mimicry remains effective as dataset complexity increases, maintaining competitive diversity and higher validity rates, confirmed by human assessors.</p></details> |  | None |

We demonstrate results for digit recognition and fruit classification on the MNIST and Fruits360 data sets. We formally compare results for four different uncertainty metrics. Finally, we observe active learning is also effective on simpler (binary) classification tasks, but marked improvement from random sampling is more evident on more difficult tasks.

Thus the knowledge growing procedure should show strong relationship along the temporal dimension. In our research, we find that during the network training, the evolution of feature map follows temporal sequence property. A proper temporal supervision may further improve the network training performance. Inspired by this observation, we propose Temporal Supervised Knowledge Distillation (TSKD). Specifically, we extract the spatiotemporal features in the different training phases of student by convolutional Long Short-term memory network (Conv-LSTM). Then, we train the student net through a dynamic target, rather than static teacher network features. This process realizes the refinement of old knowledge in student network, and utilizes it to assist current learning. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and advantages of our method over existing knowledge distillation methods, including various network architectures and different tasks (image classification and object detection) .</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is outdated and needs new improvements to make it valuable</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Layer Attention Efficiency through Pruning Redundant Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06473v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Growing evidence suggests that layer attention mechanisms, which enhance interaction among layers in deep neural networks, have significantly advanced network architectures. However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Adapting a Segmentation Foundation Model for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06217v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have shown strong performance in various vision tasks, particularly image segmentation, due to their impressive zero-shot segmentation capabilities. However, effectively adapting such models for medical image classification is still a less explored topic. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to adapt SAM for medical image classification. First, we utilize the SAM image encoder as a feature extractor to capture segmentation-based features that convey important spatial and contextual details of the image, while freezing its weights to avoid unnecessary overhead during training. Next, we propose a novel Spatially Localized Channel Attention (SLCA) mechanism to compute spatially localized attention weights for the feature maps. The features extracted from SAM's image encoder are processed through SLCA to compute attention weights, which are then integrated into deep learning classification models to enhance their focus on spatially relevant or meaningful regions of the image, thus improving classification performance. Experimental results on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and data-efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gradient-Guided Annealing for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20162v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) research has gained considerable traction as of late, since the ability to generalize to unseen data distributions is a requirement that eludes even state-of-the-art training algorithms. In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in CVPR2025</p></details> | None |

Quantum CNNs (QCNNs) leverage quantum mechanical properties and hold potential to outperform classical approaches. However, their implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remains challenging due to hardware limitations. In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to directly process $28\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum processor, achieving $96.08\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the $71.74\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training conditions. These results represent one of the first implementations of image classifications on real quantum hardware and validate the potential of quantum computing in this area.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a new set of models that build on these advancements by incorporating a new set of attention mechanisms that combines Triplet attention with Squeeze-and-Excitation (TripSE) in four different variants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of \textbf{78.27\%} on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Gradient Clipping for Robust Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14432v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust federated learning aims to maintain reliable performance despite the presence of adversarial or misbehaving workers. While state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust distributed gradient descent (Robust-DGD) methods were proven theoretically optimal, their empirical success has often relied on pre-aggregation gradient clipping. However, existing static clipping strategies yield inconsistent results: enhancing robustness against some attacks while being ineffective or even detrimental against others. To address this limitation, we propose a principled adaptive clipping strategy, Adaptive Robust Clipping (ARC), which dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on the input gradients. We prove that ARC not only preserves the theoretical robustness guarantees of SOTA Robust-DGD methods but also provably improves asymptotic convergence when the model is well-initialized. Extensive experiments on benchmark image classification tasks confirm these theoretical insights, demonstrating that ARC significantly enhances robustness, particularly in highly heterogeneous and adversarial settings.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we integrate Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) into the KAN framework to transform multi-class classification into multiple binary tasks, improving robustness via Hamming-distance decoding. Our proposed KAN with ECOC method outperforms vanilla KAN on a challenging blood cell classification dataset, achieving higher accuracy under diverse hyperparameter settings. Ablation studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of ECOC with KAN for enhancing multi-class medical image classification performance.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |
| **[Sparse inverse Cholesky factorization of dense kernel matrices by greedy conditional selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11648v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense kernel matrices resulting from pairwise evaluations of a kernel function arise naturally in machine learning and statistics. Previous work in constructing sparse approximate inverse Cholesky factors of such matrices by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence recovers the Vecchia approximation for Gaussian processes. These methods rely only on the geometry of the evaluation points to construct the sparsity pattern. In this work, we instead construct the sparsity pattern by leveraging a greedy selection algorithm that maximizes mutual information with target points, conditional on all points previously selected. For selecting $k$ points out of $N$, the naive time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N k^4)$, but by maintaining a partial Cholesky factor we reduce this to $\mathcal{O}(N k^2)$. Furthermore, for multiple ($m$) targets we achieve a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N k^2 + N m^2 + m^3)$, which is maintained in the setting of aggregated Cholesky factorization where a selected point need not condition every target. We apply the selection algorithm to image classification and recovery of sparse Cholesky factors. By minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence, we apply the algorithm to Cholesky factorization, Gaussian process regression, and preconditioning with the conjugate gradient, improving over $k$-nearest neighbors selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SIAM JUQ</p></details> | None |

Existing recognition methods often ignore structural information of image data or depend heavily on the sample size of image data. To address this issue, we develop a novel variational Bayesian method for image classification in a logistic tensor regression model with image tensor predictors by utilizing tensor decomposition to approximate tensor regression. To handle the sparsity of tensor coefficients, we introduce the multiway shrinkage priors for marginal factor vectors of tensor coefficients. In particular, we obtain a closed-form approximation to the variational posteriors for classification prediction based on the matricization of tensor decomposition. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methodologies in terms of accuracy, precision and F1 score. Flower image data and chest X-ray image data are illustrated by the proposed methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Taking heed of these limitations, we investigated in-context learning as a pragmatic alternative to model retraining by allowing models to adapt to new diagnostic tasks using only a few labeled examples at inference, without the need for retraining. Using four vision-language models (VLMs)-Paligemma, CLIP, ALIGN and GPT-4o, we evaluated the performance across three oncology datasets: MHIST, PatchCamelyon and HAM10000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the performance of multiple VLMs on different oncology classification tasks. Without any parameter updates, all models showed significant gains with few-shot prompting, with GPT-4o reaching an F1 score of 0.81 in binary classification and 0.60 in multi-class classification settings. While these results remain below the ceiling of fully fine-tuned systems, they highlight the potential of ICL to approximate task-specific behavior using only a handful of examples, reflecting how clinicians often reason from prior cases. Notably, open-source models like Paligemma and CLIP demonstrated competitive gains despite their smaller size, suggesting feasibility for deployment in computing constrained clinical environments. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of ICL as a practical solution in oncology, particularly for rare cancers and resource-limited contexts where fine-tuning is infeasible and annotated data is difficult to obtain.</p></details> |  | None |

Renowned for their exceptional accuracy, these models have become a standard for image classification tasks across diverse computer vision benchmarks. While traditional neural networks learn correlations between feature channels during training, vector-valued neural networks inherently treat multidimensional data as coherent entities, taking for granted the inter-channel relationships. This paper introduces vector-valued EfficientNets (V-EfficientNets), a novel extension of EfficientNet designed to process arbitrary vector-valued data. The proposed models are evaluated on a medical image classification task, achieving an average accuracy of 99.46% on the ALL-IDB2 dataset for detecting acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

For transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities. Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Biomed-DPT: Dual Modality Prompt Tuning for Biomedical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05189v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

Fine-tuning these models on domain-specific datasets further enhances their effectiveness for downstream applications. However, fine-tuning in cloud environments raises significant concerns regarding data security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution by enabling model training across local clients without centralizing sensitive data, but the high communication and computation costs of transmitting full pre-trained models during training limit its scalability. Additionally, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across local clients can negatively impact model convergence and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CacheFL, a novel federated learning method that replaces traditional full model fine-tuning with lightweight cache model fine-tuning. The cache model is initialized using a class-balanced dataset generated by a generative pre-trained model, effectively mitigating the impact of non-IID data. This cache model is then distributed to local clients for fine-tuning, and the updated parameters from each client are aggregated on the server and redistributed. With the updated cache model, the classification performance of CLIP is improved after just a few epochs. By limiting the training and communication to the cache model, CacheFL significantly reduces resource demands while ensuring data privacy and security. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and 10 additional datasets demonstrate that CacheFL outperforms traditional approaches in terms of classification accuracy, resource efficiency, and privacy preservation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Direct Image Classification from Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy Measurements without Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05054v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.</p></details> | ISCS 2025 | None |

Despite its growing popularity, FL faces challenges in preserving the privacy of local datasets, its sensitivity to poisoning attacks by malicious users, and its communication overhead. The latter is additionally considerably dominant in large-scale networks. These limitations are often individually mitigated by local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, robust aggregation, compression, and user selection techniques, which typically come at the cost of accuracy. In this work, we present compressed private aggregation (CPA), that allows massive deployments to simultaneously communicate at extremely low bit rates while achieving privacy, anonymity, and resilience to malicious users. CPA randomizes a codebook for compressing the data into a few bits using nested lattice quantizers, while ensuring anonymity and robustness, with a subsequent perturbation to hold LDP. The proposed CPA is proven to result in FL convergence in the same asymptotic rate as FL without privacy, compression, and robustness considerations, while satisfying both anonymity and LDP requirements. These analytical properties are empirically confirmed in a numerical study, where we demonstrate the performance gains of CPA compared with separate mechanisms for compression and privacy for training different image classification models, as well as its robustness in mitigating the harmful effects of malicious users.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.10888</p></details> | None |

However, since samples vary in difficulty, a dynamic model that adapts computation based on sample complexity offers a novel perspective for compression and scaling. Despite this potential, existing dynamic models are typically monolithic and model-specific, limiting their generalizability as broad compression and scaling methods. Additionally, most deployed DL systems are fixed, unable to adjust their scale once deployed and, therefore, cannot adapt to the varying real-time demands. This paper introduces DyCE, a dynamically configurable system that can adjust the performance-complexity trade-off of a DL model at runtime without requiring re-initialization or redeployment on inference hardware. DyCE achieves this by adding small exit networks to intermediate layers of the original model, allowing computation to terminate early if acceptable results are obtained. DyCE also decouples the design of an efficient dynamic model, facilitating easy adaptation to new base models and potential general use in compression and scaling. We also propose methods for generating optimized configurations and determining the types and positions of exit networks to achieve desired performance and complexity trade-offs. By enabling simple configuration switching, DyCE provides fine-grained performance tuning in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCE through image classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DyCE significantly reduces computational complexity by 23.5% for ResNet152 and 25.9% for ConvNextv2-tiny on ImageNet, with accuracy reductions of less than 0.5%.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed system utilizes a confidence-based gating mechanism to allocate appropriate computational resources for each input. ORXE also supports adjustments to the preference between inference cost and prediction performance across a wide range during runtime. We implemented a training-free ORXE system for image classification tasks, evaluating its efficiency and accuracy across various devices.

We propose 2SED Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (2SEDFOSGD), which integrates the Two-Scale Effective Dimension (2SED) algorithm with FOSGD to adapt the fractional exponent in a data-driven manner. By tracking model sensitivity and effective dimensionality, 2SEDFOSGD dynamically modulates the exponent to mitigate oscillations and hasten convergence. Theoretically, this approach preserves the advantages of fractional memory without the sluggish or unstable behavior observed in na\"ive fractional SGD.

Current research primarily focuses on reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse photon events, whereas the semantic interpretation of single-photon images remains underexplored, due to high annotation costs and inefficient labeling strategies. This paper presents the first active learning framework for single-photon image classification. The core contribution is an imaging condition-aware sampling strategy that integrates synthetic augmentation to model variability across imaging conditions. By identifying samples where the model is both uncertain and sensitive to these conditions, the proposed method selectively annotates only the most informative examples. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms all baselines and achieves high classification accuracy with significantly fewer labeled samples. Specifically, our approach achieves 97% accuracy on synthetic single-photon data using only 1.5% labeled samples. On real-world data, we maintain 90.63% accuracy with just 8% labeled samples, which is 4.51% higher than the best-performing baseline. This illustrates that active learning enables the same level of classification performance on single-photon images as on classical images, opening doors to large-scale integration of single-photon data in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Although FedAvg pioneered synchronous rounds for global model averaging, slower devices can delay collective progress. Asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync) addresses stragglers by continuously integrating client updates, yet naive implementations risk client drift due to non-IID data and stale contributions. Some Blockchain-based FL approaches (e.g., BRAIN) employ robust weighting or scoring of updates to resist malicious or misaligned proposals. However, performance drops can still persist under severe data heterogeneity or high staleness, and synchronization overhead has emerged as a new concern due to its aggregator-free architectures. We introduce Fast-and-Reliable AI Network, FRAIN, a new asynchronous FL method that mitigates these limitations by incorporating two key ideas. First, our FastSync strategy eliminates the need to replay past model versions, enabling newcomers and infrequent participants to efficiently approximate the global model. Second, we adopt spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) when merging parameters, preserving models' directions and alleviating destructive interference from divergent local training. Experiments with a CNN image-classification model and a Transformer-based language model demonstrate that FRAIN achieves more stable and robust convergence than FedAvg, FedAsync, and BRAIN, especially under harsh environments: non-IID data distributions, networks that experience delays and require frequent re-synchronization, and the presence of malicious nodes.</p></details> |  | None |

Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly. We verified the CMSwinKAN on the publicly available BreakHis dataset and the PpNTs dataset, which was established by our hospital. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets.

However, traditional supervised deep learning models depend on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often limited in medical imaging. Recently, Vision-Language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has been applied to image classifications. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), which classifiers image based on visual information only, VLM leverages multimodal learning with text and images, allowing it to learn effectively even with a limited amount of labeled data. Inspired by CLIP, we pro-pose a Liver-VLM, a model specifically designed for focal liver lesions (FLLs) classification. First, Liver-VLM incorporates class information into the text encoder without introducing additional inference overhead. Second, by calculating the pairwise cosine similarities between image and text embeddings and optimizing the model with a cross-entropy loss, Liver-VLM ef-fectively aligns image features with class-level text features. Experimental results on MPCT-FLLs dataset demonstrate that the Liver-VLM model out-performs both the standard CLIP and MedCLIP models in terms of accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC).

Five state-of-the-art architectures - MobileNetV3 Small, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and ShuffleNetV2 - are benchmarked across three diverse datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. The models are assessed using four key performance metrics: classification accuracy, inference time, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and model size. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and training paradigms by comparing pretrained models with scratch-trained counterparts, focusing on MobileNetV3 Small. Our findings reveal that transfer learning significantly enhances model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet. EfficientNetV2 consistently achieves the highest accuracy, while MobileNetV3 offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, and SqueezeNet excels in inference speed and compactness. This study highlights critical trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, offering actionable insights for deploying lightweight models in real-world applications where computational resources are limited. By addressing these challenges, this research contributes to optimizing deep learning systems for edge computing and mobile platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables, submitted to Springer - Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis</p></details> | None |

This is achieved by inducing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm can limit the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between invariance-related tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we introduce \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling paradigm based on joint-embedding predictive architecture that leverages architectural inductive biases to resolve this trade-off. Without requiring an additional equivariance predictor or loss term, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to the specified transformations and another invariant to them and suited for tasks such as classification. To do so, our model processes a short sequence of different views (observations) of an input image. Each encoded view is concatenated with embeddings corresponding to the relative transformation (action) producing the next observation in the sequence. A transformer encoder outputs an aggregate representation of this sequence, which is subsequently conditioned on the action leading to the next observation to predict its representation. Empirically, seq-JEPA achieves strong performance on equivariant benchmarks and image classification without sacrificing one for the other. Additionally, our framework excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from 78 percent to 93 percent when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Computer and Decision Making An International Journal (COMDEM)</p></details> | None |

This scheme, however, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, when some of the clients submit corrupted model updates. In real-world scenarios, the total number of compromised clients is typically unknown, with the extent of attacks potentially varying over time. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive approach for robust aggregation of model updates based on Bayesian inference. The mean update is defined by the maximum of the likelihood marginalized over probabilities of each client to be `honest'. As a result, the method shares the simplicity of the classical average estimators (e.g., sample mean or geometric median), being independent of the number of compromised clients. At the same time, it is as effective against attacks as methods specifically tailored to Federated Learning, such as Krum. We compare our approach with other aggregation schemes in federated setting on three benchmark image classification data sets. The proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various attack types with static and varying number of malicious clients.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

This popularity increases the importance of considering the security of MoE architectures. Unfortunately, the security of models using a MoE architecture has not yet gained much attention compared to other DNN models. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of patch-based MoE (pMoE) models for image classification against backdoor attacks. We examine multiple trigger generation methods and Fine-Pruning as a defense. To better understand a pMoE model's vulnerability to backdoor attacks, we investigate which factors affect the model's patch selection. Our work shows that pMoE models are highly susceptible to backdoor attacks. More precisely, we achieve high attack success rates of up to 100% with visible triggers and a 2% poisoning rate, whilst only having a clean accuracy drop of 1.0%. Additionally, we show that pruning itself is ineffective as a defense but that fine-tuning can remove the backdoor almost completely. Our results show that fine-tuning the model for five epochs reduces the attack success rate to 2.1% whilst sacrificing 1.4% accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

It has the ability to improve the final model's performance and accelerate the training process. However, in the medical imaging domain, data irregularities can make the recognition task more challenging and usually result in misclassification between the different classes in the dataset. Class-decomposition approaches have shown promising results in solving such a problem by learning the boundaries within the classes of the data set. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) training method based on the curriculum learning strategy and the class decomposition approach, which we call CLOG-CD, to improve the performance of medical image classification. We evaluated our method on four different imbalanced medical image datasets, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), brain tumour, digital knee X-ray, and histopathology colorectal cancer (CRC). CLOG-CD utilises the learnt weights from the decomposition granularity of the classes, and the training is accomplished from descending to ascending order (i.e., anti-curriculum technique). We also investigated the classification performance of our proposed method based on different acceleration factors and pace function curricula. We used two pre-trained networks, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121, as the backbone for CLOG-CD. The results with ResNet-50 show that CLOG-CD has the ability to improve classification performance with an accuracy of 96.08% for the CXR dataset, 96.91% for the brain tumour dataset, 79.76% for the digital knee X-ray, and 99.17% for the CRC dataset, compared to other training strategies. In addition, with DenseNet-121, CLOG-CD has achieved 94.86%, 94.63%, 76.19%, and 99.45% for CXR, brain tumour, digital knee X-ray, and CRC datasets, respectively</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing</p></details> | None |

Among such devices, smart glasses have particularly benefited from TinyML advancements. TinyML facilitates the on-device execution of the inference phase of ML algorithms on embedded and wearable devices, and more recently, it has expanded into On-device Learning (ODL), which allows both inference and learning phases to occur directly on the device. The application of ODL techniques to wearable devices is particularly compelling, as it enables the development of more personalized models that adapt based on the data of the user. However, one of the major challenges of ODL algorithms is the scarcity of labeled data collected on-device. In smart wearable contexts, requiring users to manually label large amounts of data is often impractical and could lead to user disengagement with the technology. To address this issue, this paper explores the application of Active Learning (AL) techniques, i.e., techniques that aim at minimizing the labeling effort, by actively selecting from a large quantity of unlabeled data only a small subset to be labeled and added to the training set of the algorithm. In particular, we propose TActiLE, a novel AL algorithm that selects from the stream of on-device sensor data the ones that would help the ML algorithm improve the most once coupled with labels provided by the user. TActiLE is the first Active Learning technique specifically designed for the TinyML context. We evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency through experiments on multiple image classification datasets. The results demonstrate its suitability for tiny and wearable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the "Eyes Of The Future: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Smart Eyewear (IAISE)" Workshop, Held at the "International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025"</p></details> | None |

Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact.

In computer vision, the attention mechanism was first incorporated in the Vision Transformer ViT, and then its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While the attention mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the disadvantage of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more attempts with different sets of advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block. The newly proposed block reduces the computational requirements by replacing the normal attention layers with a Network in Network structure, therefore enhancing the static approach of the MLP-Mixer with a dynamic learning of element-wise gating function generated by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Comput & Applic (2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Interpretability-Aware Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08035v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become prominent models for solving various vision tasks. However, the interpretability of ViTs has not kept pace with their promising performance. While there has been a surge of interest in developing {\it post hoc} solutions to explain ViTs' outputs, these methods do not generalize to different downstream tasks and various transformer architectures. Furthermore, if ViTs are not properly trained with the given data and do not prioritize the region of interest, the {\it post hoc} methods would be less effective. Instead of developing another {\it post hoc} approach, we introduce a novel training procedure that inherently enhances model interpretability. Our interpretability-aware ViT (IA-ViT) draws inspiration from a fresh insight: both the class patch and image patches consistently generate predicted distributions and attention maps. IA-ViT is composed of a feature extractor, a predictor, and an interpreter, which are trained jointly with an interpretability-aware training objective. Consequently, the interpreter simulates the behavior of the predictor and provides a faithful explanation through its single-head self-attention mechanism. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IA-ViT in several image classification tasks, with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of model performance and interpretability.

Initial works on ``exact'' unlearning (e.g., retraining) incur large computational overheads. However, while computationally inexpensive, ``approximate'' methods have fallen short of reaching the effectiveness of exact unlearning: models produced fail to obtain comparable accuracy and prediction confidence on both the forget and test (i.e., unseen) dataset. Exploiting this observation, we propose a new unlearning method, Adversarial Machine UNlearning (AMUN), that outperforms prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for image classification. AMUN lowers the confidence of the model on the forget samples by fine-tuning the model on their corresponding adversarial examples. Adversarial examples naturally belong to the distribution imposed by the model on the input space; fine-tuning the model on the adversarial examples closest to the corresponding forget samples (a) localizes the changes to the decision boundary of the model around each forget sample and (b) avoids drastic changes to the global behavior of the model, thereby preserving the model's accuracy on test samples. Using AMUN for unlearning a random $10\%$ of CIFAR-10 samples, we observe that even SOTA membership inference attacks cannot do better than random guessing.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

This paper introduces the information theoretic principle of Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) to LLM fine-tuning for classification tasks, exploring its promise in two main ways: minimizing CMI to improve a model's standalone performance and maximizing CMI to enhance knowledge distillation (KD) for more capable student models. To apply CMI in LLM fine-tuning, we adapt the recently proposed CMI-constrained deep learning framework, which was initially developed for image classification, with some modification. By minimizing CMI during LLM fine-tuning, we achieve superior performance gains on 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to BERT. Additionally, maximizing CMI during the KD process results in significant performance improvements in 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to DistilBERT. These findings demonstrate CMI's adaptability for optimizing both standalone LLMs and student models, showcasing its potential as a robust framework for advancing LLM fine-tuning.

Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, which prevents them from learning from each other. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions within a single transformer. EgoAgent introduces two innovations to learn from the causal and temporally intertwined nature of these abilities: (1) Interleaved sequential modeling of states and actions with the causal attention mechanism, and (2) A joint embedding-action-prediction architecture featuring temporal asymmetric predictor-observer branches. Integrating these designs based on JEPA, EgoAgent unifies these capabilities in a cohesive learning framework. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.

However, existing Mamba-based methods usually neglect the spectral and spatial directional characteristics related to heterogeneous objects in hyperspectral scenes, leading to limited classification performance. To address these issues, we propose MambaMoE, a novel spectral-spatial mixture-of-experts framework, representing the first MoE-based approach in the HSI classification community. Specifically, we design a Mixture of Mamba Expert Block (MoMEB) that leverages sparse expert activation to enable adaptive spectral-spatial modeling. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-guided corrective learning (UGCL) strategy to encourage the model's attention toward complex regions prone to prediction ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple public HSI benchmarks demonstrate that MambaMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing advanced approaches, especially for Mamba-based methods.

Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training method for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has inspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such alternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a biologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses throughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers, thereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study presents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its effectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks. Our experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve high accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and convergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron count, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations formed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature extraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that EDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks and will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods select Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data as backdoor watermarks and retrain the original model for copyright protection. However, existing methods are susceptible to malicious detection and forgery by adversaries, resulting in watermark evasion. In this work, we propose Model-\underline{ag}nostic Black-box Backdoor W\underline{ate}rmarking Framework (AGATE) to address stealthiness and robustness challenges in multimodal model copyright protection. Specifically, we propose an adversarial trigger generation method to generate stealthy adversarial triggers from ordinary dataset, providing visual fidelity while inducing semantic shifts. To alleviate the issue of anomaly detection among model outputs, we propose a post-transform module to correct the model output by narrowing the distance between adversarial trigger image embedding and text embedding. Subsequently, a two-phase watermark verification is proposed to judge whether the current model infringes by comparing the two results with and without the transform module. Consequently, we consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods across five datasets in the downstream tasks of multimodal image-text retrieval and image classification. Additionally, we validated the robustness of AGATE under two adversarial attack scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Remote sensing surveys complement field-based approaches, and their reach can be especially great when combined with deep learning and computer vision techniques. However, conventional supervised deep learning methods face challenges in annotating fine-grained archaeological features at scale. While recent vision foundation models have shown remarkable success in learning large-scale remote sensing data with minimal annotations, most off-the-shelf solutions are designed for RGB images rather than multi-spectral satellite imagery, such as the 8-band data used in our study. In this paper, we introduce DeepAndes, a transformer-based vision foundation model trained on three million multi-spectral satellite images, specifically tailored for Andean archaeology. DeepAndes incorporates a customized DINOv2 self-supervised learning algorithm optimized for 8-band multi-spectral imagery, marking the first foundation model designed explicitly for the Andes region. We evaluate its image understanding performance through imbalanced image classification, image instance retrieval, and pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that DeepAndes achieves superior F1 scores, mean average precision, and Dice scores in few-shot learning scenarios, significantly outperforming models trained from scratch or pre-trained on smaller datasets. This underscores the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training in archaeological remote sensing.

Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

These methods construct graphs where image patches serve as nodes, and edges are established based on patch similarity or classification relevance. Despite their efficiency, the explainability of GNN-based vision models remains underexplored, even though graphs are naturally interpretable. In this work, we analyze the semantic consistency of the graphs formed at different layers of GNN-based image classifiers, focusing on how well they preserve object structures and meaningful relationships. A comprehensive analysis is presented by quantifying the extent to which inter-layer graph connections reflect semantic similarity and spatial coherence. Explanations from standard and adversarial settings are also compared to assess whether they reflect the classifiers' robustness. Additionally, we visualize the flow of information across layers through heatmap-based visualization techniques, thereby highlighting the models' explainability.

It can be achieved through instruction set extensions and corresponding custom functional units. Yet, efficiently exploiting these opportunities requires a hardware/software co-design approach in which the DNN model, software, and hardware are designed together. In this paper, we propose novel RISC-V extensions for accelerating DNN models containing semi-structured and unstructured sparsity. While the idea of accelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design offers various advantages over other designs. To exploit semi-structured sparsity, we take advantage of the fine-grained (bit-level) configurability of FPGAs and suggest reserving a few bits in a block of DNN weights to encode the information about sparsity in the succeeding blocks. The proposed custom functional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit unstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential multiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the non-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured pruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4, respectively. We then propose a combined design that can accelerate both types of sparsities, providing speedups of up to a factor of 5. Our designs consume a small amount of additional FPGA resources such that the resulting co-designs enable the acceleration of DNNs even on small FPGAs. We benchmark our designs on standard TinyML applications such as keyword spotting, image classification, and person detection.</p></details> |  | None |

The study presents experiments on training specialists for image classification and object detection tasks. The results demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy even without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by constraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying traditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically coherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is proposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the evolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to future research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image analysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input. Additionally, the proposed methods can help improve system performance in scenarios where certain data domains should be excluded from consideration of the generalist network.</p></details> |  | None |

Its architectural flexibility and capabilities have made it a preferred choice among researchers and practitioners. However, the intricate multi-head attention mechanism of ViT presents significant challenges to interpretability, as the underlying prediction process remains opaque. A critical limitation arises from an observation commonly noted in transformer architectures: "Not all attention heads are equally meaningful." Overlooking the relative importance of specific heads highlights the limitations of existing interpretability methods. To address these challenges, we introduce Gradient-Driven Multi-Head Attention Rollout (GMAR), a novel method that quantifies the importance of each attention head using gradient-based scores. These scores are normalized to derive a weighted aggregate attention score, effectively capturing the relative contributions of individual heads. GMAR clarifies the role of each head in the prediction process, enabling more precise interpretability at the head level. Experimental results demonstrate that GMAR consistently outperforms traditional attention rollout techniques. This work provides a practical contribution to transformer-based architectures, establishing a robust framework for enhancing the interpretability of Vision Transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |

It has been mainstream that the teacher directly transfers knowledge to the student with its original distribution, which can possibly lead to incorrect predictions. In this article, we propose a logit-based distillation via swapped logit processing, namely Swapped Logit Distillation (SLD). SLD is proposed under two assumptions: (1) the wrong prediction occurs when the prediction label confidence is not the maximum; (2) the "natural" limit of probability remains uncertain as the best value addition to the target cannot be determined. To address these issues, we propose a swapped logit processing scheme. Through this approach, we find that the swap method can be effectively extended to teacher and student outputs, transforming into two teachers. We further introduce loss scheduling to boost the performance of two teachers' alignment. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that SLD consistently performs best among previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Multimedia Systems 2025</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we analyze why attention-based methods tend to rely on spurious correlations in their predictions. Furthermore, we revisit max-pooling-based approaches and examine the reasons behind the underperformance of existing methods. We argue that well-trained max-pooling-based MIL models can make predictions based on causal factors and avoid relying on spurious correlations. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective max-pooling-based MIL method (FocusMIL) that outperforms existing mainstream attention-based methods on two datasets. In this position paper, we advocate renewed attention to max-pooling-based methods to achieve more robust and interpretable predictions.</p></details> |  | None |

Domain shifts caused by sensor differences and environmental variations further hinder cross-dataset adaptability. Metric-based few-shot learning (FSL) prototype networks mitigate this problem, yet their performance is sensitive to prototype quality, especially with limited samples. To overcome these challenges, a dual-branch residual network that integrates spatial and spectral features via parallel branches is proposed in this letter. Additionally, more robust refined prototypes are obtained through a regulation term. Furthermore, a kernel probability matching strategy aligns source and target domain features, alleviating domain shift. Experiments on four publicly available HSI datasets illustrate that the proposal achieves superior performance compared to other methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures.

Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by preconditioning the stochastic gradient with a diagonal matrix. Despite the widespread adoption of first-order methods, second-order optimization algorithms often exhibit superior convergence compared to methods like Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited by a significantly higher per-iteration computational cost compared to first-order methods. In this thesis, we present AdaFisher, a novel adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix to adaptively precondition gradients. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between the improved convergence and generalization of second-order methods and the computational efficiency needed for training DNNs. Despite the traditionally slower speed of second-order optimizers, AdaFisher is effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling, exhibiting remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in both accuracy and convergence speed.

Specifically, while human perception can easily identify abnormal appearances or compositions in images, classification models overlook any alterations in the arrangement of object parts as long as they are present in any order, even if unnatural. Hence, this work exposes the vulnerability of having semantic and syntactic discrepancy in images (SSDI) in the form of corruptions that remove or shuffle image patches or present images in the form of puzzles. To address this vulnerability, we propose the concept of "image grammar", comprising "image semantics" and "image syntax". Image semantics pertains to the interpretation of parts or patches within an image, whereas image syntax refers to the arrangement of these parts to form a coherent object. We present a semi-supervised two-stage method for learning the image grammar of visual elements and environments solely from natural images. While the first stage learns the semantic meaning of individual object parts, the second stage learns how their relative arrangement constitutes an entire object. The efficacy of the proposed approach is then demonstrated by achieving SSDI detection rates ranging from 70% to 90% on corruptions generated from CelebA and SUN-RGBD datasets.

While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Edge-Based Learning for Improved Classification Under Adversarial Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20077v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial noise introduces small perturbations in images, misleading deep learning models into misclassification and significantly impacting recognition accuracy. In this study, we analyzed the effects of Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial noise on image classification and investigated whether training on specific image features can improve robustness. We hypothesize that while adversarial noise perturbs various regions of an image, edges may remain relatively stable and provide essential structural information for classification. To test this, we conducted a series of experiments using brain tumor and COVID datasets. Initially, we trained the models on clean images and then introduced subtle adversarial perturbations, which caused deep learning models to significantly misclassify the images. Retraining on a combination of clean and noisy images led to improved performance. To evaluate the robustness of the edge features, we extracted edges from the original/clean images and trained the models exclusively on edge-based representations. When noise was introduced to the images, the edge-based models demonstrated greater resilience to adversarial attacks compared to those trained on the original or clean images. These results suggest that while adversarial noise is able to exploit complex non-edge regions significantly more than edges, the improvement in the accuracy after retraining is marginally more in the original data as compared to the edges. Thus, leveraging edge-based learning can improve the resilience of deep learning models against adversarial perturbations.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a challenging task that has received significant attention in recent years. Specifically, OOD detection refers to the detection of instances that do not belong to the training distribution, while still having good performance on the in-distribution task (e.g., classification or object detection). Recent work has focused on generating synthetic outliers and using them to train an outlier detector, generally achieving improved OOD detection than traditional OOD methods. In this regard, outliers can be generated either in feature or pixel space. Feature space driven methods have shown strong performance on both the classification and object detection tasks, at the expense that the visualization of training outliers remains unknown, making further analysis on OOD failure modes challenging. On the other hand, pixel space outlier generation techniques enabled by diffusion models have been used for image classification using, providing improved OOD detection performance and outlier visualization, although their adaption to the object detection task is as yet unexplored. We therefore introduce Dream-Box, a method that provides a link to object-wise outlier generation in the pixel space for OOD detection. Specifically, we use diffusion models to generate object-wise outliers that are used to train an object detector for an in-distribution task and OOD detection. Our method achieves comparable performance to previous traditional methods while being the first technique to provide concrete visualization of generated OOD objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, LatinX in AI CVPR 2025 Workshop</p></details> | None |

In order to deploy these models in extremely resource-constrained edge devices, it is crucial to reduce their peak memory, which is the maximum memory consumed during the execution of a model. A naive approach to reducing peak memory is aggressive down-sampling of feature maps via pooling with large stride, which often results in unacceptable degradation in network performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose residual encoded distillation (ReDistill) for peak memory reduction in a teacher-student framework, in which a student network with less memory is derived from the teacher network using aggressive pooling. We apply our distillation method to multiple problems in computer vision, including image classification and diffusion-based image generation. For image classification, our method yields 4x-5x theoretical peak memory reduction with less degradation in accuracy for most CNN-based architectures. For diffusion-based image generation, our proposed distillation method yields a denoising network with 4x lower theoretical peak memory while maintaining decent diversity and fidelity for image generation. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to other feature-based and response-based distillation methods when applied to the same student network.

This shortcoming is highlighted in areas where data annotation becomes a time-consuming and error-prone task. In this regard, SSL tackles this challenge by capitalizing on scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data; however, SoTA methods typically depend on pre-trained features and large validation sets to learn effective representations for classification tasks. In addition, the reduced set of labeled data is often randomly sampled, neglecting the selection of more informative samples. Here, we present active-DeepFA, a method that effectively combines CL, teacher-student-based meta-pseudo-labeling and AL to train non-pretrained CNN architectures for image classification in scenarios of scarcity of labeled and abundance of unlabeled data. It integrates DeepFA into a co-training setup that implements two cooperative networks to mitigate confirmation bias from pseudo-labels. The method starts with a reduced set of labeled samples by warming up the networks with supervised CL. Afterward and at regular epoch intervals, label propagation is performed on the 2D projections of the networks' deep features. Next, the most reliable pseudo-labels are exchanged between networks in a cross-training fashion, while the most meaningful samples are annotated and added into the labeled set. The networks independently minimize an objective loss function comprising supervised contrastive, supervised and semi-supervised loss components, enhancing the representations towards image classification. Our approach is evaluated on three challenging biological image datasets using only 5% of labeled samples, improving baselines and outperforming six other SoTA methods. In addition, it reduces annotation effort by achieving comparable results to those of its counterparts with only 3% of labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society (JBCS) [https://journals-sol.sbc.org.br]</p></details> | None |
| **[Examining the Impact of Optical Aberrations to Image Classification and Object Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18510v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be successful in various computer vision applications such that models even infer in safety-critical situations. Therefore, vision models have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as noise or blur. While seminal benchmarks exist to evaluate model robustness to diverse corruptions, blur is often approximated in an overly simplistic way to model defocus, while ignoring the different blur kernel shapes that result from optical systems. To study model robustness against realistic optical blur effects, this paper proposes two datasets of blur corruptions, which we denote OpticsBench and LensCorruptions. OpticsBench examines primary aberrations such as coma, defocus, and astigmatism, i.e. aberrations that can be represented by varying a single parameter of Zernike polynomials. To go beyond the principled but synthetic setting of primary aberrations, LensCorruptions samples linear combinations in the vector space spanned by Zernike polynomials, corresponding to 100 real lenses. Evaluations for image classification and object detection on ImageNet and MSCOCO show that for a variety of different pre-trained models, the performance on OpticsBench and LensCorruptions varies significantly, indicating the need to consider realistic image corruptions to evaluate a model's robustness against blur.</p></details> | v1.0 | None |

Training these models requires huge investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven development of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD (PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023), designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose DMS-Net, a dual-modal multi-scale Siamese network for binocular fundus image classification. Our framework leverages weight-shared Siamese ResNet-152 backbones to extract deep semantic features from paired fundus images. To tackle challenges such as lesion boundary ambiguity and scattered pathological distributions, we introduce a Multi-Scale Context-Aware Module (MSCAM) that integrates adaptive pooling and attention mechanisms for multi-resolution feature aggregation. Additionally, a Dual-Modal Feature Fusion (DMFF) module enhances cross-modal interaction through spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention, effectively combining global context and local edge features. Evaluated on the ODIR-5K dataset, DMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with 80.5% accuracy, 86.1% recall, and 83.8% Cohen's kappa, demonstrating superior capability in detecting symmetric pathologies and advancing clinical decision-making for ocular diseases.</p></details> |  | None |

However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> | None |

One of the main obstacles to the interpretation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which mixes visual information across the whole image in a complex way. In this paper, we propose Hindered Transformer (HiT), a novel interpretable by design architecture inspired by visual transformers. Our proposed architecture rethinks the design of transformers to better disentangle patch influences at the classification stage. Ultimately, HiT can be interpreted as a linear combination of patch-level information. We show that the advantages of our approach in terms of explicability come with a reasonable trade-off in performance, making it an attractive alternative for applications where interpretability is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 official version.

| **[Enhanced Sample Selection with Confidence Tracking: Identifying Correctly Labeled yet Hard-to-Learn Samples in Noisy Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17474v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes. Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing methods for learning with noisy labels.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover, represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture [12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating and Mitigating Bias in AI-Based Medical Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17279v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on deep learning models, have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races, sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales, and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

| **[Group Downsampling with Equivariant Anti-aliasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17258v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following: (a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into G-equivariant networks</p></details> |  | None |

This paper seeks to delve deeper into various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The cross-layer perspective explored in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning application side.

| **[Embedding Radiomics into Vision Transformers for Multimodal Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10916v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical image analysis, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) offering a powerful alternative to convolutional models by modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, ViTs are inherently data-intensive and lack domain-specific inductive biases, limiting their applicability in medical imaging. In contrast, radiomics provides interpretable, handcrafted descriptors of tissue heterogeneity but suffers from limited scalability and integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. In this work, we propose the Radiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features with data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone. Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and patch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in medical image classification. Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into patches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused with linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were normalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable [CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated RE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal OCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. RE-ViT was benchmarked against CNN-based (VGG-16, ResNet) and hybrid (TransMed) models. Results: RE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art results: on BUSI, AUC=0.950+/-0.011; on ChestXray2017, AUC=0.989+/-0.004; on Retinal OCT, AUC=0.986+/-0.001, which outperforms other comparison models. Conclusions: The RE-ViT framework effectively integrates radiomics with ViT architectures, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability across multimodal medical image classification tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[A Deep Bayesian Convolutional Spiking Neural Network-based CAD system with Uncertainty Quantification for Medical Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17819v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Computer_Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems facilitate accurate diagnosis of diseases. The development of CADs by leveraging third generation neural network, namely, Spiking Neural Network (SNN), is essential to utilize of the benefits of SNNs, such as their event_driven processing, parallelism, low power consumption, and the ability to process sparse temporal_spatial information. However, Deep SNN as a deep learning model faces challenges with unreliability. To deal with unreliability challenges due to inability to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions, we proposed a deep Bayesian Convolutional Spiking Neural Network based_CADs with uncertainty_aware module. In this study, the Monte Carlo Dropout method as Bayesian approximation is used as an uncertainty quantification method. This method was applied to several medical image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is accurate and reliable and will be a proper alternative to conventional deep learning for medical image classification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Diff-Attention Aware State Space Fusion Model for Remote Sensing Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16665v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images describe the same land surface, so these images not only have their own advantages, but also have a lot of similar information. In order to separate these similar information and their respective advantages, reduce the feature redundancy in the fusion stage. This paper introduces a diff-attention aware state space fusion model (DAS2F-Model) for multimodal remote sensing image classification. Based on the selective state space model, a cross-modal diff-attention module (CMDA-Module) is designed to extract and separate the common features and their respective dominant features of MS and PAN images. Among this, space preserving visual mamba (SPVM) retains image spatial features and captures local features by optimizing visual mamba's input reasonably. Considering that features in the fusion stage will have large semantic differences after feature separation and simple fusion operations struggle to effectively integrate these significantly different features, an attention-aware linear fusion module (AALF-Module) is proposed. It performs pixel-wise linear fusion by calculating influence coefficients. This mechanism can fuse features with large semantic differences while keeping the feature size unchanged. Empirical evaluations indicate that the presented method achieves better results than alternative approaches.

| **[An Effective Gram Matrix Characterizes Generalization in Deep Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16450v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a differential equation that governs the evolution of the generalization gap when a deep network is trained by gradient descent. This differential equation is controlled by two quantities, a contraction factor that brings together trajectories corresponding to slightly different datasets, and a perturbation factor that accounts for them training on different datasets. We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram matrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap after training in terms of the alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''. Empirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this analysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, at any point during training, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the training process is benign, i.e., it does not lead to significant deterioration of the generalization gap (which is zero at initialization). The alignment between the effective Gram matrix and the residual is different for different datasets and architectures. The match/mismatch of the data and the architecture is primarily responsible for good/bad generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SparseJEPA: Sparse Representation Learning of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16140v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) have emerged as a powerful framework for learning general-purpose representations. However, these models often lack interpretability and suffer from inefficiencies due to dense embedding representations. We propose SparseJEPA, an extension that integrates sparse representation learning into the JEPA framework to enhance the quality of learned representations. SparseJEPA employs a penalty method that encourages latent space variables to be shared among data features with strong semantic relationships, while maintaining predictive performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SparseJEPA by training on the CIFAR-100 dataset and pre-training a lightweight Vision Transformer. The improved embeddings are utilized in linear-probe transfer learning for both image classification and low-level tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility across different transfer tasks. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof that demonstrates that the grouping mechanism enhances representation quality. This was done by displaying that grouping reduces Multiinformation among latent-variables, including proofing the Data Processing Inequality for Multiinformation. Our results indicate that incorporating sparsity not only refines the latent space but also facilitates the learning of more meaningful and interpretable representations. In further work, hope to further extend this method by finding new ways to leverage the grouping mechanism through object-centric representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Through extensive experimentation, we compare the performance of traditional CNN-based, ResNet-based, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in terms of accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 has excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 has proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite EO tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient RS-IC in satellite operations, achieving 98.76 % of accuracy, precision, and recall. Precisely, EfficientViT-M2 delivers the highest performance across all metrics, excels in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrates greater robustness (overall robustness score of 0.79). Consequently, EfficientViT-M2 consumes 63.93 % less power than MobileViTV2 (79.23 W) and 73.26 % less power than SwinTransformer (108.90 W). This highlights its significant advantage in energy efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
