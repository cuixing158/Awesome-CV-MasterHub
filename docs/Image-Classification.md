| **[Zero-Shot Decentralized Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26462v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly, ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large vision-language models in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025.

| **[MAPLE: Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25863v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI) classification by aligning visual features with textual representations, thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization. Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Conformal Guidance for Learning under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16736v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning systems. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a broadly applicable solution for learning under uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |

We present RobustNeuralNetworks.jl: a Julia package for neural network models that are constructed to naturally satisfy a set of user-defined robustness metrics. The package is based on the recently proposed Recurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) and Lipschitz-Bounded Deep Network (LBDN) model classes, and is designed to interface directly with Julia's most widely-used machine learning package, Flux.jl. We discuss the theory behind our model parameterization, give an overview of the package, and provide a tutorial demonstrating its use in image classification, reinforcement learning, and nonlinear state-observer design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Proceedings of the JuliaCon Conferences</p></details> | None |
| **[Accelerating Dynamic Image Graph Construction on FPGA for Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25121v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Graph Neural Networks (Vision GNNs, or ViGs) represent images as unstructured graphs, achieving state of the art performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) builds image graphs by connecting patches (nodes) based on feature similarity, and is dynamically repeated in each ViG layer following GNN based patch (node) feature updates. However, DIGC constitutes over 50% of end to end ViG inference latency, rising to 95% at high image resolutions, making it the dominant computational bottleneck. While hardware acceleration holds promise, prior works primarily optimize graph construction algorithmically, often compromising DIGC flexibility, accuracy, or generality. To address these limitations, we propose a streaming, deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator for DIGC, featuring on chip buffers that process input features in small, uniform blocks. Our design minimizes external memory traffic via localized computation and performs efficient parallel sorting with local merge sort and global k way merging directly on streaming input blocks via heap insertion. This modular architecture scales seamlessly across image resolutions, ViG layer types, and model sizes and variants, and supports DIGC across diverse ViG based vision backbones. The design achieves high clock frequencies post place and route due to the statically configured parallelism minimizing critical path delay and delivers up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups over optimized CPU and GPU DIGC baselines.</p></details> | IEEE HPEC 2025 | None |
| **[The Geometry of Cortical Computation: Manifold Disentanglement and Predictive Dynamics in VCNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02995v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations.

Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex, where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration, VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven state evolution. This hybrid formulation captures complex patterns while requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures. VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and Imagenet1K.</p></details> | 5 pages | None |
| **[Interpretable 3D Neural Object Volumes for Robust Conceptual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13429v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of deep neural networks, especially in safety-critical applications, robustness and interpretability are crucial to ensure their trustworthiness. Recent advances in 3D-aware classifiers that map image features to volumetric representation of objects, rather than relying solely on 2D appearance, have greatly improved robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Such classifiers have not yet been studied from the perspective of interpretability. Meanwhile, current concept-based XAI methods often neglect OOD robustness. We aim to address both aspects with CAVE - Concept Aware Volumes for Explanations - a new direction that unifies interpretability and robustness in image classification. We design CAVE as a robust and inherently interpretable classifier that learns sparse concepts from 3D object representation. We further propose 3D Consistency (3D-C), a metric to measure spatial consistency of concepts. Unlike existing metrics that rely on human-annotated parts on images, 3D-C leverages ground-truth object meshes as a common surface to project and compare explanations across concept-based methods. CAVE achieves competitive classification performance while discovering consistent and meaningful concepts across images in various OOD settings.

| **[GenMix: Effective Data Augmentation with Generative Diffusion Model Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02366v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is widely used to enhance generalization in visual classification tasks. However, traditional methods struggle when source and target domains differ, as in domain adaptation, due to their inability to address domain gaps. This paper introduces GenMix, a generalizable prompt-guided generative data augmentation approach that enhances both in-domain and cross-domain image classification. Our technique leverages image editing to generate augmented images based on custom conditional prompts, designed specifically for each problem type. By blending portions of the input image with its edited generative counterpart and incorporating fractal patterns, our approach mitigates unrealistic images and label ambiguity, improving the performance and adversarial robustness of the resulting models. Efficacy of our method is established with extensive experiments on eight public datasets for general and fine-grained classification, in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Additionally, we demonstrate performance improvements for self-supervised learning, learning with data scarcity, and adversarial robustness. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, our technique achieves stronger performance across the board.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://diffusemix.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[MIAFEx: An Attention-based Feature Extraction Method for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08562v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature extraction techniques are crucial in medical image classification; however, classical feature extractors, in addition to traditional machine learning classifiers, often exhibit significant limitations in providing sufficient discriminative information for complex image sets. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output feature quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating their superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

| **[Combining Discrepancy-Confusion Uncertainty and Calibration Diversity for Active Fine-Grained Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24181v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification, assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value. DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[High-Order Progressive Trajectory Matching for Medical Image Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24177v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets. Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states, overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets.

| **[Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24095v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction can be used to construct prediction sets that cover the true outcome with a desired probability, but can sometimes lead to large prediction sets that are costly in practice. The most useful outcome is a singleton prediction-an unambiguous decision-yet existing efficiency-oriented methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a new nonconformity score that aims to minimize the probability of producing non-singleton sets. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency (sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on average set size.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging the Task Gap: Multi-Task Adversarial Transferability in CLIP and Its Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23917v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models, without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CE-FAM: Concept-Based Explanation via Fusion of Activation Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23849v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast, conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores. Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Spatially Parallel All-optical Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23611v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Deep Taxonomic Networks for Unsupervised Hierarchical Prototype Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23602v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy, specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |
| **[S$^3$F-Net: A Multi-Modal Approach to Medical Image Classification via Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23442v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features. However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI).

| **[Dynamics of Learning: Generative Schedules from Latent ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23052v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions. It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be made available after acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, comments welcome</p></details> | None |
| **[MonoCon: A general framework for learning ultra-compact high-fidelity representations using monotonicity constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22931v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on $\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Diagnosing and Mitigating Modality Interference in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19616v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals -- particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering -- which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem -- the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks -- such as image classification or pure text question answering -- where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem, and we further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to finetune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations, and a consistency regularization strategy applying on model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy and multimodal tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FishAI 2.0: Marine Fish Image Classification with Multi-modal Few-shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22930v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0 model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0 achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58 percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI 2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent approaches have explored generating synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025.

However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

In the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent, even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes and different modalities.

To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M FLOPs) at IoT device.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, PIMRC Conference 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Filtering with Confidence: When Data Augmentation Meets Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21479v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications, synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical: effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection, showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks are Incomplete on Graphs with a Simple Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05530v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 10 pages main text | None |

We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CBMI 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix) |

This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting.

However, extending these models from static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos, which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes, or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Nowadays, such ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that collects millions of plant image queries all over the world.

However, existing QAT-KD methods often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals, improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models (SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Current bias mitigation methods usually either achieve high level of fairness with the degradation of accuracy, or only improve the model fairness on a single attribute. Additionally usually most bias mitigation strategies are either pre hoc through data processing or post hoc through fairness evaluation, instead of being integrated into the model learning itself. To solve these existing drawbacks, we propose a new Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin tone normalization and data augmentation method that directly feeds into an adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework. In skin tone normalization, ITA is used to estimate skin tone type and adjust automatically to target tones for dataset balancing. In the joint channel pruning framework, two nested optimization loops are used to find critical channels.The inner optimization loop finds and prunes the local critical channels by weighted soft nearest neighbor loss, and the outer optimization loop updates the weight of each attribute using group wise variance loss on meta-set. Experiments conducted in the ISIC2019 dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in simultaneously improving the fairness of the model on multiple sensitive attributes without significant degradation of accuracy. Finally, although the pruning mechanism adds some computational cost during training phase, usually training is done off line. More importantly,</p></details> | 29pages, 12 figures | None |

By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> | None |

However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack (calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest the need for robust defenses.

Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset, referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent, lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present a novel sponge attack called SkipSponge. SkipSponge is the first sponge attack that is performed directly on the parameters of a pretrained model using only a few data samples. Our experiments show that SkipSponge can successfully increase the energy consumption of image classification models, GANs, and autoencoders, requiring fewer samples than the state-of-the-art sponge attacks (Sponge Poisoning). We show that poisoning defenses are ineffective if not adjusted specifically for the defense against SkipSponge (i.e., they decrease target layer bias values) and that SkipSponge is more effective on the GANs and the autoencoders than Sponge Poisoning. Additionally, SkipSponge is stealthy as it does not require significant changes to the victim model's parameters. Our experiments indicate that SkipSponge can be performed even when an attacker has access to less than 1% of the entire training dataset and reaches up to 13% energy increase.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) 2025</p></details> | None |

The goal was to assess whether general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers, and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis: (RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2) classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset, where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows, suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the study to other classification strategies and models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures | None |

Conventional mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures suffer from suboptimal coordination dynamics, where isolated expert operations expose the model to overfitting risks. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention blocks, which limits further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes the transformer model into an equivalent group of experts and applies a hierarchical routing mechanism to allocate input subspaces to specialized experts. Our approach advances MoE design with four key innovations: (1) Constructing expert groups by partitioning non-MoE models into functionally equivalent specialists (2) Developing a hierarchical routing paradigm that integrates patch-wise data selection and expert selection strategies. (3) Extending the MoE design to attention blocks. (4) Proposing a hardware-optimized parallelization scheme that exploits batched matrix multiplications for efficient expert computation. The experiments demonstrate that our UoE model surpasses Full Attention, state-of-the-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains. In language modeling tasks, UoE achieves an average reduction of 2.38 in perplexity compared to the best-performing MoE method with only 76% of its FLOPs. In the Long Range Arena benchmark, it demonstrates an average score at least 0.68% higher than all comparison models, with only 50% of the FLOPs of the best MoE method. In image classification, it yields an average accuracy improvement of 1.75% over the best model while maintaining comparable FLOPs.

Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%, respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and classification performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

As a key component of the transformer model, self-attention calculates the attention values by mapping the relationships among the head elements of the source and target sequence, yet there is no explicit mechanism to refine and intensify the attention values with respect to the context of the input and target sequences. Based on this intuition, we introduce a novel refine and intensify attention mechanism that is called Zoneup Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC), in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input source and target sequences are first refined using GELU and dropout and then intensified using a proposed zoneup process which includes the injection of a learned scalar factor. Our extensive experiments show that ZoDIAC achieves statistically significant higher scores under all image captioning metrics using various feature extractors in comparison to the conventional self-attention module in the transformer model on the MS-COCO dataset.

Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Elucidating the Design Space of FP4 training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17791v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of foundation models have spurred research into low-precision training, with 4-bit floating-point (\texttt{FP4}) formats emerging as a frontier for maximizing hardware throughput. While numerous techniques have been proposed to stabilize \texttt{FP4} training, they often present isolated solutions with varying, and not always clear, computational overheads. This paper aims to provide a unified view of the design space of \texttt{FP4} training. We introduce a comprehensive, quantisation gradient-based framework for microscaling quantization that allows for a theoretical analysis of the computational costs associated with different stabilization methods on both the forward and backward passes. Using a simulator built on this framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, image classification, diffusion models, and language models. By systematically evaluating thousands of combinations of techniques, such as novel gradient approximations, rounding strategies, and scaling methods, we identify which configurations offer the most favourable performance-to-overhead trade-off. We find that the techniques enabling the best trade-off involve carefully combining Hadamard transformations, tensor scaling and stochastic rounding. We further find that using \texttt{UE5M3} as a scaling factor potentially offers a good compromise between range and precision with manageable computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

This is especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification (CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically, HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP improvements of 10.0\% and 5.2\% on the long-tailed multi-label image classification task, and 6.8\% and 2.9\% on the multi-label few-shot image classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> | None |

However, existing MCoT methods rely on rationale-rich datasets and largely focus on inter-object reasoning, overlooking the intra-object understanding crucial for image classification. To address this gap, we propose WISE, a Weak-supervision-guided Step-by-step Explanation method that augments any image classification dataset with MCoTs by reformulating the concept-based representations from Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) into concise, interpretable reasoning chains under weak supervision. Experiments across ten datasets show that our generated MCoTs not only improve interpretability by 37% but also lead to gains in classification accuracy when used to fine-tune MLLMs. Our work bridges concept-based interpretability and generative MCoT reasoning, providing a generalizable framework for enhancing MLLMs in fine-grained visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> | None |
| **[Multimodal Medical Image Classification via Synergistic Learning Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17492v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal pathological images are usually in clinical diagnosis, but computer vision-based multimodal image-assisted diagnosis faces challenges with modality fusion, especially in the absence of expert-annotated data. To achieve the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning" framework for multimodal semi-supervised medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods.

To address this challenge, we propose HyperTTA (Test-Time Adaptable Transformer for Hyperspectral Degradation), a unified framework that enhances model robustness under diverse degradation conditions. First, we construct a multi-degradation hyperspectral benchmark that systematically simulates nine representative degradations, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robust classification. Based on this benchmark, we develop a Spectral--Spatial Transformer Classifier (SSTC) with a multi-level receptive field mechanism and label smoothing regularization to capture multi-scale spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight test-time adaptation strategy, the Confidence-aware Entropy-minimized LayerNorm Adapter (CELA), which dynamically updates only the affine parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This strategy ensures reliable adaptation without access to source data or target labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios. Code will be made available publicly.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%, representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67% and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Word ...</summary><p>Word count: 5157, Table count: 2, Figure count: 5</p></details> | None |

We establish the first reproducible baseline for solar filament chirality classification on the MAGFiLO dataset. The MAGFiLO dataset contains over 10,000 manually-annotated filaments from GONG H-Alpha observations, making it the largest dataset for filament detection and classification to date. Prior studies relied on much smaller datasets, which limited their generalizability and comparability. We fine-tuned several pre-trained, image classification architectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, ResNeXt, and ConvNeXt, and also applied data augmentation and per-class loss weights to optimize the models. Our best model, ConvNeXtBase, achieves a per-class accuracy of 0.69 for left chirality filaments and $0.73$ for right chirality filaments.</p></details> |  | None |

We study the black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix $A \in R^{k \times n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors $v \in R^n$ to lower-dimensional sketches $A v \in R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain approximate $\ell_2$-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch. We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using $\tilde{O}(k^2)$ queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution (used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching matrix and to the estimator: it applies to any linear sketch and any query responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the query distribution. Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of $\tilde{\Omega}(k^2)$, achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification, highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17153v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes (FiD-GP), a compression framework that incorporates a compact inducing weight matrix to project a neural network's weight uncertainty into a lower-dimensional subspace. Critically, FiD-GP relies on normalising-flow priors and spectral regularisations to augment its expressiveness and align the inducing subspace with feature-gradient geometry through a numerically stable projection mechanism objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction framework in FiD-GP can help to design a single-pass projection for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection. Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression, image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude, compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 1st MICCAI Workshop on Efficient Medical AI 2025</p></details> | None |

This chapter provides comprehensive architectural analysis of BCFL systems through a systematic four-dimensional taxonomy examining coordination structures, consensus mechanisms, storage architectures, and trust models. We analyze design patterns from blockchain-verified centralized coordination to fully decentralized peer-to-peer networks, evaluating trade-offs in scalability, security, and performance. Through detailed examination of consensus mechanisms designed for federated learning contexts, including Proof of Quality and Proof of Federated Learning, we demonstrate how computational work can be repurposed from arbitrary cryptographic puzzles to productive machine learning tasks. The chapter addresses critical storage challenges by examining multi-tier architectures that balance blockchain's transaction constraints with neural networks' large parameter requirements while maintaining cryptographic integrity. A technical case study of the TrustMesh framework illustrates practical implementation considerations in BCFL systems through distributed image classification training, demonstrating effective collaborative learning across IoT devices with highly non-IID data distributions while maintaining complete transparency and fault tolerance. Analysis of real-world deployments across healthcare consortiums, financial services, and IoT security applications validates the practical viability of BCFL systems, achieving performance comparable to centralized approaches while providing enhanced security guarantees and enabling new models of trustless collaborative intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, chapter for edited book (Federated Learning: Foundations and Applications)</p></details> | None |

However, existing CFE methods often rely on additional image encoders and generative models to create plausible images, neglecting the classifier's own feature space and decision boundaries. As such, they do not explain the intrinsic feature space and decision boundaries learned by the classifier. To address this limitation, we propose Mirror-CFE, a novel method that generates faithful counterfactual explanations by operating directly in the classifier's feature space, treating decision boundaries as mirrors that ``reflect'' feature representations in the mirror. Mirror-CFE learns a mapping function from feature space to image space while preserving distance relationships, enabling smooth transitions between source images and their counterfactuals. Through extensive experiments on four image datasets, we demonstrate that Mirror-CFE achieves superior performance in validity while maintaining input resemblance compared to state-of-the-art explanation methods. Finally, mirror-CFE provides interpretable visualization of the classifier's decision process by generating step-wise transitions that reveal how features evolve as classification confidence changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2025</p></details> | None |

This approach is motivated by the fact that commonly used gradient-based optimization methods can suffer from the barren plateaus problem. PSO is a stochastic optimization technique inspired by the collective behavior of a swarm of birds. The dimension of the swarm, the number of iterations of the algorithm, and the number of trainable parameters can be set. In this study, PSO has been used to train the entire structure of VQCs, allowing it to select which quantum gates to apply, the target qubits, and the rotation angle, in case a rotation is chosen. The algorithm is restricted to choosing from four types of gates: Rx, Ry, Rz, and CNOT. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on various datasets of the MedMNIST, which is a collection of biomedical image datasets designed for image classification tasks. Performance has been compared with the results achieved by classical stochastic gradient descent applied to a predefined VQC. The results show that the PSO can achieve comparable or even better classification accuracy across multiple datasets, despite the PSO using a lower number of quantum gates than the VQC used with gradient descent optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

As rotation layers, all combinations of one and two rotation sequences are considered. Four different entanglement topologies are compared: linear, circular, pairwise, and full. Different tasks are considered, namely the generation of probability distributions and images, and image classification. Achieved results are correlated with the expressibility and entanglement capability of the different circuits to understand how these features affect performance.</p></details> |  | None |

This is a critical task for market organization with a tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient. Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification performance. The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset generalization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking in RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking is crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT without thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate No-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types. Experimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or matches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may hinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate this effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to explore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an Adaptive-Thinking method. Experiments show that it converges to a specific prompt depending on model capability and task complexity, achieving comparable or better performance than both Thinking and No-Thinking-RL. This suggests MLLMs can adaptively decide to think or not based on their capabilities and task complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2025 Spotlight</p></details> | None |

Within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer, training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer would generate an idealized dynamical trajectory. The idealized trajectory is designed to reproduce the activations of a neural network trained to perform the desired computation. This teacher-student scheme results in a thermodynamic computer whose finite-time dynamics enacts a computation analogous to that of the neural network. The parameters identified in this way can be implemented in the hardware realization of the thermodynamic computer, which will perform the desired computation automatically, driven by thermal noise. We demonstrate the method on a standard image-classification task, and estimate the thermodynamic advantage -- the ratio of energy costs of the digital and thermodynamic implementations -- to exceed seven orders of magnitude. Our results establish gradient descent as a viable training method for thermodynamic computing, enabling application of the core methodology of machine learning to this emerging field.</p></details> |  | None |

An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.</p></details> | 24 pages, XAI 2025 | None |

To explore the potential of perceptually motivated inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i) incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MARIC: Multi-Agent Reasoning for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14860v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs) alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step, producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and interpretable image classification.</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[Self Identity Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks. We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness.

Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed, multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification, text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead, hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single, general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over 15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times, with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5 Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over advertising data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The M-PACE framework uses a "mother-child" AI model system to automate and unify compliance checks for ads, reducing costs while maintaining high accuracy</p></details> | None |

We unify these directions by introducing quantum variational activation functions (QVAFs), realized through single-qubit data re-uploading circuits called DatA Re-Uploading ActivatioNs (DARUANs). We show that DARUAN with trainable weights in data pre-processing possesses an exponentially growing frequency spectrum with data repetitions, enabling an exponential reduction in parameter size compared with Fourier-based activations without loss of expressivity. Embedding DARUAN into KANs yields quantum-inspired KANs (QKANs), which retain the interpretability of KANs while improving their parameter efficiency, expressivity, and generalization. We further introduce two novel techniques to enhance scalability, feasibility and computational efficiency, such as layer extension and hybrid QKANs (HQKANs) as drop-in replacements of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for feed-forward networks in large-scale models. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on function regression, image classification, and autoregressive generative language modeling, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of QKANs. DARUANs and QKANs offer a promising direction for advancing quantum machine learning on both noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and classical quantum simulators.</p></details> | 45 pages | None |

The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NON A...</summary><p>NON ARCHIVAL PRESENTATION 1st workshop on Dataset Distillation CVPR 2024</p></details> | None |

This study introduces spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for accurate medical image classification with limited, diverse datasets. The models include SBTAYLOR-KAN, integrating B-splines with Taylor series; SBRBF-KAN, combining B-splines with Radial Basis Functions; and SBWAVELET-KAN, embedding B-splines in Morlet wavelet transforms. These approaches leverage spline-based function approximation to capture both local and global nonlinearities. The models were evaluated on brain MRI, chest X-rays, tuberculosis X-rays, and skin lesion images without preprocessing, demonstrating the ability to learn directly from raw data. Extensive experiments, including cross-dataset validation and data reduction analysis, showed strong generalization and stability. SBTAYLOR-KAN achieved up to 98.93% accuracy, with a balanced F1-score, maintaining over 86% accuracy using only 30% of the training data across three datasets. Despite class imbalance in the skin cancer dataset, experiments on both imbalanced and balanced versions showed SBTAYLOR-KAN outperforming other models, achieving 68.22% accuracy. Unlike traditional CNNs, which require millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet50 with 24.18M), SBTAYLOR-KAN achieves comparable performance with just 2,872 trainable parameters, making it more suitable for constrained medical environments. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used for interpretability, highlighting relevant regions in medical images. This framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable solution for medical image classification, addressing the challenges of limited datasets and data-scarce scenarios in clinical AI applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Lookup Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13662v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks are constructed with massive operations with different types and are highly computationally intensive. Among these operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and usually requires {more} energy consumption with longer inference time than other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks (both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both images and point clouds).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD: Robust and Efficient Data-Parallel Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18454v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and continue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven developtment of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD (PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023), designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR | None |

However, in real-world FL settings, client data is often non-identically distributed and imbalanced, resulting in statistical data heterogeneity which impacts the generalization capabilities of the server's model across clients, slows convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing first a characterization of statistical data heterogeneity by means of 6 metrics of global and client attribute imbalance, class imbalance, and spurious correlations. Next, we create and share 7 computer vision datasets for binary and multiclass image classification tasks in Federated Learning that cover a broad range of statistical data heterogeneity and hence simulate real-world situations. Finally, we propose FEDDIVERSE, a novel client selection algorithm in FL which is designed to manage and leverage data heterogeneity across clients by promoting collaboration between clients with complementary data distributions. Experiments on the seven proposed FL datasets demonstrate FEDDIVERSE's effectiveness in enhancing the performance and robustness of a variety of FL methods while having low communication and computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>3rd I...</summary><p>3rd IEEE International Conference on Federated Learning Technologies and Applications (FLTA 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, the limited availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives. These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12917v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth) models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper explores strategies for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike uniform distributions, BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and supports any labelled multi-class dataset.

We propose TED pruning, a method that addresses the challenge of overfitting under high pruning ratios by quantifying the model's ability to improve performance on pruned data while fitting retained data, known as Internal Generalization (IG). TED uses an optimization objective based on Internal Generalization Distance (IGD), measuring changes in IG before and after pruning to align with true generalization performance and achieve implicit regularization. The IGD optimization objective was verified to allow the model to achieve the smallest upper bound on generalization error. The impact of small mask fluctuations on IG is studied through masks and Taylor approximation, and fast estimation of IGD is enabled. In analyzing continuous training dynamics, the prior effect of IGD is validated, and a progressive pruning strategy is proposed. Experiments on image classification, natural language understanding, and large language model fine-tuning show TED achieves lossless performance with 60-70\% of the data. Upon acceptance, our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | ECAI 2024 | None |

However, their considerable parameter size restricts their applicability, particularly on mobile devices. Due to the dynamic and intricate nature of gradients on TM compared to Convolutional Neural Networks, commonly used pruning methods tend to retain weights with larger gradient noise. This results in pruned models that are sensitive to sparsity and datasets, exhibiting suboptimal performance. Symbolic Descent (SD) is a general approach for training and fine-tuning TM. In this paper, we attempt to describe the noisy batch gradient sequences on TM through the cumulative process of SD. We utilize this design to dynamically assess the importance scores of weights.SEVEN is introduced by us, which particularly favors weights with consistently high sensitivity, i.e., weights with small gradient noise. These weights are tended to be preserved by SEVEN. Extensive experiments on various TM in natural language, question-answering, and image classification domains are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SEVEN. The results demonstrate significant improvements of SEVEN in multiple pruning scenarios and across different sparsity levels. Additionally, SEVEN exhibits robust performance under various fine-tuning strategies.

We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling.

The proposed algorithm can be viewed as an extension of the Jacobi eigenvalue method for symmetric matrices diagonalization to the case where we want to approximate just a few extreme eigenvalues/eigenvectors. The method is also particularly well-suited for the computation of sparse approximations of the eigenvectors. In fact, we show that in general, our method provides a trade-off between the sparsity of the computed approximate eigenspaces and their accuracy. We provide theoretical results that show the linear convergence of the proposed method. Finally, we show experimental numerical results for sparse low-rank approximations of random symmetric matrices and show applications to graph Fourier transforms, and the sparse principal component analysis in image classification experiments. These applications are chosen because, in these cases, there is no need to perform the eigenvalue decomposition to high precision to achieve good numerical results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13353v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\% (STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%, 32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%) and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g., 21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\% robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization (9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

A key reason for this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations. Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware, resilient representations.</p></details> | 12pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[The Impact of Skin Tone Label Granularity on the Performance and Fairness of AI Based Dermatology Image Classification Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11184v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact (on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and 5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better represents the diversity of human skin tones.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches face significant limitations in undefined domains, where the label space is vocabulary-unknown and composite. We thus introduce Generative Semantic Labels (GSLs), a novel task that aims to predict a comprehensive set of semantic labels for an image without being constrained by a predefined labels set. Unlike traditional zero-shot classification, GSLs generates multiple semantic-level labels, encompassing objects, scenes, attributes, and relationships, thereby providing a richer and more accurate representation of image content. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Action (CoA), an innovative method designed to tackle the GSLs task. CoA is motivated by the observation that enriched contextual information significantly improves generative performance during inference. Specifically, CoA decomposes the GSLs task into a sequence of detailed actions. Each action extracts and merges key information from the previous step, passing enriched context to the next, ultimately guiding the VLM to generate comprehensive and accurate semantic labels. We evaluate the effectiveness of CoA through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements across key performance metrics, validating the capability of CoA to generate accurate and contextually rich semantic labels. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in generative semantic labels but also opens new avenues for applying VLMs in open-ended and dynamic real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures | None |

Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the SB to various image classification tasks. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the target task.</p></details> |  | None |

We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks, specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors. Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined (e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance, robustness, and utility in the medical space.</p></details> |  | None |

The addition of calculated small distortion to images, for instance, can deceive a well-trained image classification network. In this work, we propose a novel attack technique called Sparse Adversarial and Interpretable Attack Framework (SAIF). Specifically, we design imperceptible attacks that contain low-magnitude perturbations at a small number of pixels and leverage these sparse attacks to reveal the vulnerability of classifiers. We use the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm to simultaneously optimize the attack perturbations for bounded magnitude and sparsity with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence. Empirical results show that SAIF computes highly imperceptible and interpretable adversarial examples, and outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attack methods on the ImageNet dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

To assess the quality of explainability methods, we approach the task through the lens of accuracy and stability. In this work, we make the following contributions. Firstly, we introduce the Weighting Game, which measures how much of a class-guided explanation is contained within the correct class' segmentation mask. Secondly, we introduce a metric for explanation stability, using zooming/panning transformations to measure differences between saliency maps with similar contents. Quantitative experiments are produced, using these new metrics, to evaluate the quality of explanations provided by commonly used CAM methods. The quality of explanations is also contrasted between different model architectures, with findings highlighting the need to consider model architecture when choosing an explainability method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: Image Analysis (SCIA 2025), Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), vol. 15726, pp. 325-338 (2025).

| **[Image Recognition with Vision and Language Embeddings of VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09311v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision that improves classification performance.

However, although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics. To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as the research area to perform ground object classification research. A classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%, and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies, vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level, indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample training conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EgoAgent: A Joint Predictive Agent Model in Egocentric Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05857v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning an agent model that behaves like humans-capable of jointly perceiving the environment, predicting the future, and taking actions from a first-person perspective-is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing methods typically train separate models for these abilities, which fail to capture their intrinsic relationships and prevent them from learning from each other. Inspired by how humans learn through the perception-action loop, we propose EgoAgent, a unified agent model that simultaneously learns to represent, predict, and act within a single transformer. EgoAgent explicitly models the causal and temporal dependencies among these abilities by formulating the task as an interleaved sequence of states and actions. It further introduces a joint embedding-action-prediction architecture with temporally asymmetric predictor and observer branches, enabling synergistic optimization across all three capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/zju3dv/EgoAgent.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the segmentation results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Combining Audio and Non-Audio Inputs in Evolved Neural Networks for Ovenbird](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10566v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last several years the use of neural networks as tools to automate species classification from digital data has increased. This has been due in part to the high classification accuracy of image classification through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of audio data CNN based recognizers are used to automate the classification of species in audio recordings by using information from sound visualization (i.e., spectrograms). It is common for these recognizers to use the spectrogram as their sole input. However, researchers have other non-audio data, such as habitat preferences of a species, phenology, and range information, available that could improve species classification. In this paper we present how a single-species recognizer neural network's accuracy can be improved by using non-audio data as inputs in addition to spectrogram information. We also analyze if the improvements are merely a result of having a neural network with a higher number of parameters instead of combining the two inputs. We find that networks that use the two different inputs have a higher classification accuracy than networks of similar size that use only one of the inputs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However, their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of transformers for small-scale vision.

| **[Have Large Vision-Language Models Mastered Art History?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03521v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has established new baselines in image classification across multiple domains. We examine whether their multimodal reasoning can also address a challenge mastered by human experts. Specifically, we test whether VLMs can classify the style, author and creation date of paintings, a domain traditionally mastered by art historians. Artworks pose a unique challenge compared to natural images due to their inherently complex and diverse structures, characterized by variable compositions and styles. This requires a contextual and stylistic interpretation rather than straightforward object recognition. Art historians have long studied the unique aspects of artworks, with style prediction being a crucial component of their discipline. This paper investigates whether large VLMs, which integrate visual and textual data, can effectively reason about the historical and stylistic attributes of paintings. We present the first study of its kind, conducting an in-depth analysis of three VLMs, namely CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4o, evaluating their zero-shot classification of art style, author and time period. Using two image benchmarks of artworks, we assess the models' ability to interpret style, evaluate their sensitivity to prompts, and examine failure cases. Additionally, we focus on how these models compare to human art historical expertise by analyzing misclassifications, providing insights into their reasoning and classification patterns.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UOPSL: Unpaired OCT Predilection Sites Learning for Fundus Image Diagnosis Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08624v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective, the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space. During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9 diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing benchmarks.</p></details> | BIBM | None |
| **[Beyond Distribution Shifts: Adaptive Hyperspectral Image Classification at Test Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08436v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise, blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme. Code will be made available publicly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosted Training of Lightweight Early Exits for Optimizing CNN Image Classification Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08318v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets. Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy" samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples. This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions. Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment, we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10 dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45 percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation. These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then, similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports. The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework by formulating heterogeneous FL as a hierarchical optimization problem. This new framework captures both local and global training processes through a bilevel formulation and is capable of the following: (i) addressing client heterogeneity through a personalized learning framework; (ii) capturing the pre-training process on the server side; (iii) updating the global model through nonstandard aggregation; (iv) allowing for nonidentical local steps; and (v) capturing clients' local constraints. We design and analyze an implicit zeroth-order FL method (ZO-HFL), equipped with nonasymptotic convergence guarantees for both the server-agent and the individual client-agents, and asymptotic guarantees for both the server-agent and client-agents in an almost sure sense. Notably, our method does not rely on standard assumptions in heterogeneous FL, such as the bounded gradient dissimilarity condition. We implement our method on image classification tasks and compare with other methods under different heterogeneous settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Maximizing Information in Domain-Invariant Representation Improves Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00262v5)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MaxDIRep, a domain adaptation method that improves the decomposition of data representations into domain-independent and domain-dependent components. Existing methods, such as Domain-Separation Networks (DSN), use a weak orthogonality constraint between these components, which can lead to label-relevant features being partially encoded in the domain-dependent representation (DDRep) rather than the domain-independent representation (DIRep). As a result, information crucial for target-domain classification may be missing from the DIRep. MaxDIRep addresses this issue by applying a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint to minimize the information content of the DDRep, thereby encouraging the DIRep to retain features that are both domain-invariant and predictive of target labels. Through geometric analysis and an ablation study on synthetic datasets, we show why DSN's weaker constraint can lead to suboptimal adaptation. Experiments on standard image benchmarks and a network intrusion detection task demonstrate that MaxDIRep achieves strong performance, works with pretrained models, and generalizes to non-image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Nearest Neighbor Projection Removal Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07673v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT.

Five state-of-the-art architectures - MobileNetV3 Small, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and ShuffleNetV2 - are benchmarked across three diverse datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. The models are assessed using four key performance metrics: classification accuracy, inference time, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and model size.

Our findings reveal that transfer learning significantly enhances model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet. EfficientNetV2 consistently achieves the highest accuracy, while MobileNetV3 offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, and SqueezeNet excels in inference speed and compactness. This study highlights critical trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, offering actionable insights for deploying lightweight models in real-world applications where computational resources are limited.

However, traditional diagnostic methods and existing monocular image-based deep learning approaches often overlook the pathological correlations between the two eyes. In practical medical robotic diagnostic scenarios, paired retinal images (binocular fundus images) are frequently required as diagnostic evidence. To address this, we propose DMS-Net-a dual-modal multi-scale siamese network for binocular retinal image classification. The framework employs a weight-sharing siamese ResNet-152 architecture to concurrently extract deep semantic features from bilateral fundus images. To tackle challenges like indistinct lesion boundaries and diffuse pathological distributions, we introduce the OmniPool Spatial Integrator Module (OSIM), which achieves multi-resolution feature aggregation through multi-scale adaptive pooling and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the Calibrated Analogous Semantic Fusion Module (CASFM) leverages spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention mechanisms to enhance cross-modal interaction, aggregating modality-agnostic representations of fundus structures. To fully exploit the differential semantic information of lesions present in bilateral fundus features, we introduce the Cross-Modal Contrastive Alignment Module (CCAM). Additionally, to enhance the aggregation of lesion-correlated semantic information, we introduce the Cross-Modal Integrative Alignment Module (CIAM). Evaluation on the ODIR-5K dataset demonstrates that DMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 82.9%, recall of 84.5%, and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 83.2%, showcasing robust capacity in detecting symmetrical pathologies and improving clinical decision-making for ocular diseases.

We present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches, independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images), MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908) of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability: MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is publicly available with reproducible training and inference scripts and contributes to safer, explainable AI-assisted diagnostics across medical imaging domains.

| **[FilterFL: Knowledge Filtering-based Data-Free Backdoor Defense for Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11333v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) enables large-scale clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. However, due to the lack of data auditing for untrusted clients, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, especially backdoor attacks. By using poisoned data for local training or directly changing the model parameters, attackers can easily inject backdoors into the model, which can trigger the model to make misclassification of targeted patterns in images. To address these issues, we propose a novel data-free trigger-generation-based defense approach based on the two characteristics of backdoor attacks: i) triggers are learned faster than normal knowledge, and ii) trigger patterns have a greater effect on image classification than normal class patterns. Our approach generates the images with newly learned knowledge by identifying the differences between the old and new global models, and filters trigger images by evaluating the effect of these generated images. By using these trigger images, our approach eliminates poisoned models to ensure the updated global model is benign. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can defend against almost all the existing types of backdoor attacks and outperform all the seven state-of-the-art defense methods with both IID and non-IID scenarios. Especially, our approach can successfully defend against the backdoor attack even when 80\% of the clients are malicious.</p></details> |  | None |

Several critical real-world applications make things more complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this, so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised approaches. Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data, thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time.

An active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging, especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101 datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack (AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels, and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, Accepted at ECAI 2025 (28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence)</p></details> | None |

These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers, including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one. This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected, convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages; 2 figures; 5 tables; 8 algorithms</p></details> | None |

Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels, each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification, segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine.

The series of models that employ our methodology are collectively known as Noisy Neural Networks (NoisyNN), with examples such as NoisyViT and NoisyCNN. Noise is conventionally viewed as a harmful perturbation in various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), as well as different learning tasks like image classification and transfer learning. However, this work shows noise can be an effective way to change the entropy of the learning system. We demonstrate that specific noise can boost the performance of various deep models under certain conditions. We theoretically prove the enhancement gained from positive noise by reducing the task complexity defined by information entropy and experimentally show the significant performance gain in large image datasets, such as the ImageNet. Herein, we use the information entropy to define the complexity of the task. We categorize the noise into two types, positive noise (PN) and harmful noise (HN), based on whether the noise can help reduce the task complexity. Extensive experiments of CNNs and ViTs have shown performance improvements by proactively injecting positive noise, where we achieved an unprecedented top 1 accuracy of 95$\%$ on ImageNet. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence have confirmed that the presence of positive noise, can benefit the learning process, while the traditionally perceived harmful noise indeed impairs deep learning models. The different roles of noise offer new explanations for deep models on specific tasks and provide a new paradigm for improving model performance. Moreover, it reminds us that we can influence the performance of learning systems via information entropy change.</p></details> | <details><summary>Task ...</summary><p>Task Entropy, ViT, CNN</p></details> | None |

Brain health is critical to human life, and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model performance was assessed using F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5% Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN, UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices such as wearable monitors and smart imaging systems continuously collect real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset validation, EfficientNetB2 achieved the strongest performance among fine-tuned EfficientNet models, with 92.11% precision, 92.11% recall/sensitivity, 95.96% specificity, 92.02% F1-score, and 92.23% accuracy. These findings underscore the robustness and reliability of AI models in handling diverse datasets, reinforcing their potential to enhance brain tumor classification and patient care in IoT healthcare environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Physical neural networks try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently. In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints, detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying further efforts in their development.</p></details> |  | None |

However, for edge devices even inference has too large computational complexity and data access amount. The inference latency of state-of-the-art models are impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a high utilization energy-aware real-time inference deep convolutional neural network accelerator, which improves the performance of the current accelerators. First, we use the 1x1 size convolution kernel as the smallest unit of the computing unit. Then we design suitable computing unit based on the requirements of each model. Secondly, we use Reuse Feature SRAM to store the output of the current layer in the chip and use the value as the input of the next layer. Moreover, we import Output Reuse Strategy and Ring Stream Dataflow to reduce the amount of data exchange between chips and DRAM. Finally, we present On-fly Pooling Module to let the calculation of the Pooling layer directly complete in the chip. With the aid of the proposed method, the implemented acceleration chip has an extremely high hardware utilization rate. We reduce a generous amount of data transfer on the specific module, ECNN. Compared to the methods without reuse strategy, we can reduce 533 times of data access amount. At the same time, we have enough computing power to perform real-time execution of the existing image classification model, VGG16 and MobileNet. Compared with the design in VWA, we can speed up 7.52 times and have 1.92x energy efficiency</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs, encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search.

Unlike conventional quaternion neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO, DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware perception and application in other domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

Attributing Accountability in Modern AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00175v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI systems are typically developed through multiple stages-pretraining, fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment, where each stage builds on the previous ones and updates the model in distinct ways. This raises a critical question of accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is responsible, and to what extent? We pose the accountability attribution problem for tracing model behavior back to specific stages of the model development process. To address this challenge, we propose a general framework that answers counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model's behavior have changed if the updates from a particular stage had not occurred? Within this framework, we introduce estimators that efficiently quantify stage effects without retraining the model, accounting for both the data and key aspects of model optimization dynamics, including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. We demonstrate that our approach successfully quantifies the accountability of each stage to the model's behavior. Based on the attribution results, our method can identify and remove spurious correlations learned during image classification and text toxicity detection tasks that were developed across multiple stages. Our approach provides a practical tool for model analysis and represents a significant step toward more accountable AI development.</p></details> |  | None |

By analyzing the embeddings of the training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several classification models, showing consistent performance gains across architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction reliability is critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,4 tables, 5 images</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we explore the potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.</p></details> | Accepted to ICIP2025 | None |

However, it is well-established that these ML models are vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model deployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad category is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can reverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in its training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks (MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of privacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model inversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are interpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality. Additionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model architectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we present a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from MIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss. Our DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to improve effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate effectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot classification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several state-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image classification task that is typical in military applications. In general, our innovative pipeline extends the current model inversion DT&E capabilities by improving the effectiveness and scalability of the privacy loss analysis in an automated fashion.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their high computational complexity, large memory footprints, and irregular data access patterns present significant challenges for deployment in latency- and power-constrained environments. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide an attractive hardware platform for such workloads due to their reconfigurability, fine-grained parallelism, and potential for energy-efficient acceleration. This paper presents a comprehensive review of design trade-offs, optimization strategies, and implementation challenges for FPGA-based inference of transformers and VLMs. We examine critical factors such as device-class selection, memory subsystem constraints, dataflow orchestration, quantization strategies, sparsity exploitation, and toolchain choices, alongside modality-specific issues unique to VLMs, including heterogeneous compute balancing and cross-attention memory management. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in hardware-algorithm co-design, highlighting innovations in attention mechanisms, compression, and modular overlays to improve efficiency and adaptability. Practical issues such as runtime flexibility, verification overhead, and the absence of standardized FPGA multimodal benchmarks are also considered. Finally, we outline future directions toward scalable, portable, and reconfigurable FPGA solutions that adapt to evolving model architectures while sustaining high utilization and predictable performance. This synthesis offers both a technical foundation and a forward-looking perspective to help bridge the gap between advanced multimodal AI models and efficient FPGA deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training, while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing} strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model, further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | ACM MM25 | None |

Twofold goals are examined; to understand the mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks. The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT) increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently, higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token. These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 18 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

To reduce inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.</p></details> |  | None |

It proposes an innovative two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning. Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI research from theory to practice.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation arises from two key factors: (1) medical images exhibit extensive anatomical variation and low contrast, necessitating a large receptive field to capture critical features, and (2) existing PEFT methods do not explicitly address the enhancement of receptive fields. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Large Kernel Adapter (LKA), designed to expand the receptive field while maintaining parameter efficiency. The proposed LKA consists of three key components: down-projection, channel-wise large kernel convolution, and up-projection. Through extensive experiments on various datasets and pre-trained models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a larger kernel size is pivotal in enhancing the adaptation of pre-trained models for medical image analysis. Our proposed LKA outperforms 11 commonly used PEFT methods, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.5% in top-1 accuracy across five medical datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been withdrawn in order to revise key technical components and improve experimental validation.

To balance these competing demands, over-provisioned deep learning models such as transformers are trained for a single epoch on large data sets, and hence inefficient with both computing resources and training data. In response to these inefficiencies, we derive a provably good algorithm that can combine any training and pruning methods to simultaneously optimize efficiency and accuracy, identifying conditions that resist overfitting and reduce model size while outperforming the underlying training algorithm. We then use the algorithm to combine gradient descent with magnitude pruning into "Occam Gradient Descent." With respect to loss, compute and model size (a) on image classification benchmarks, linear and convolutional neural networks trained with Occam Gradient Descent outperform traditional gradient descent with or without post-train pruning; (b) on a range of tabular data classification tasks, neural networks trained with Occam Gradient Descent outperform traditional gradient descent, as well as Random Forests; (c) on natural language transformers, Occam Gradient Descent outperforms traditional gradient descent.</p></details> |  | None |

While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Frontiers in Neuroinformatics (2025), Article 1515873.

| **[Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience) and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions (ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance. For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to 0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Building on recent theoretical proposals, we introduce a family of QON architectures based on Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometers, incorporating different photon modulation strategies -- phase, amplitude, and intensity. These physical setups yield distinct pre-activation functions, which we implement as fully differentiable modules in software. We evaluate these QONs both in isolation and as building blocks of multilayer networks, training them on binary and multiclass image classification tasks using the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Our experiments show that two configurations -- HOM-based amplitude modulation and MZ-based phase-shifted modulation -- achieve performance comparable to that of classical neurons in several settings, and in some cases exhibit faster or more stable convergence. In contrast, intensity-based encodings display greater sensitivity to distributional shifts and training instabilities. These results highlight the potential of QONs as efficient and scalable components for future quantum-inspired neural architectures and hybrid photonic-electronic systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-label classification, where each image may belong to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000 soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%, a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32 and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 23 pages, 6 images, 1 table</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method, FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and OOD image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of 0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical settings.</p></details> | ACM Multimedia 2025 | None |

Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result, modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization, but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba (CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of reducing the network training burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, accpeted by 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium(IGARSS 2025),not published yet</p></details> | None |

At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses (or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC, which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs, offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft supervision can vary during training. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework. First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically, guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.</p></details> |  | None |

Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00351v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization (SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority. This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target environments with unseen data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their computational and energy demands have grown proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints and non-differentiability. We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization, revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning. Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance.</p></details> | PhD thesis | None |

Although these models are kept secret, a malicious party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised, making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field. This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks. Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing attacks.</p></details> | Under review | None |

In image classification, most advances in DA have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557 simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective adaptation of models to medical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Information Sciences</p></details> | None |

In real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost, followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose a machine-centric image quality assessment (MIQA) framework that quantifies the impact of image degradations on MVS performance. We establish an MIQA paradigm encompassing the end-to-end assessment workflow. To support this, we construct a machine-centric image quality database (MIQD-2.5M), comprising 2.5 million samples that capture distinctive degradation responses in both consistency and accuracy metrics, spanning 75 vision models, 250 degradation types, and three representative vision tasks. We further propose a region-aware MIQA (RA-MIQA) model to evaluate MVS visual quality through fine-grained spatial degradation analysis. Extensive experiments benchmark the proposed RA-MIQA against seven human visual system (HVS)-based IQA metrics and five retrained classical backbones. Results demonstrate RA-MIQA's superior performance in multiple dimensions, e.g., achieving SRCC gains of 13.56% on consistency and 13.37% on accuracy for image classification, while also revealing task-specific degradation sensitivities. Critically, HVS-based metrics prove inadequate for MVS quality prediction, while even specialized MIQA models struggle with background degradations, accuracy-oriented estimation, and subtle distortions. This study can advance MVS reliability and establish foundations for machine-centric image processing and optimization.

TE quantifies directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and dimensions. We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing algorithms are successful and well-justified in this task when the intended target domain, where the trained model will be used, shares data distribution with the aggregate of clients, but this is often violated in practice. A common reason is label shift -- that the label distributions differ between clients and the target domain. We demonstrate empirically that this can significantly degrade performance. To address this problem, we propose FedPALS, a principled and practical model aggregation scheme that adapts to label shifts to improve performance in the target domain by leveraging knowledge of label distributions at the central server. Our approach ensures unbiased updates under federated stochastic gradient descent which yields robust generalization across clients with diverse, label-shifted data. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that FedPALS consistently outperforms baselines by aligning model aggregation with the target domain. Our findings reveal that conventional federated learning methods suffer severely in cases of extreme label sparsity on clients, highlighting the critical need for target-aware aggregation as offered by FedPALS.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces EVM-Fusion, an Explainable Vision Mamba architecture featuring a novel Neural Algorithmic Fusion (NAF) mechanism for multi-organ medical image classification. EVM-Fusion leverages a multipath design, where DenseNet and U-Net based pathways, enhanced by Vision Mamba (Vim) modules, operate in parallel with a traditional feature pathway. These diverse features are dynamically integrated via a two-stage fusion process: cross-modal attention followed by the iterative NAF block, which learns an adaptive fusion algorithm. Intrinsic explainability is embedded through path-specific spatial attention, Vim {\Delta}-value maps, traditional feature SE-attention, and cross-modal attention weights. Experiments on a diverse 9-class multi-organ medical image dataset demonstrate EVM-Fusion's strong classification performance, achieving 99.75% test accuracy and provide multi-faceted insights into its decision-making process, highlighting its potential for trustworthy AI in medical diagnostics.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective, methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks, fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.</p></details> | Accepted to BMVC2025 | None |
| **[Class-wise Flooding Regularization for Imbalanced Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18723v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes, leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization, an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better overall generalization.</p></details> | Accepted to ACPR2025 | None |

High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC (MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability. Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers, bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates $\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction, achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection. Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and -100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, was presented at the 9th International Conference 'Deep Learning on Computational Physics (DLCP2025)', and is currently under review for the Moscow University Physics Bulletin, Physics series</p></details> | None |

Although recent TTA has shown promising performance, we still face two key challenges: 1) prior methods perform backpropagation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable optimization costs to many applications; 2) while existing TTA can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as forgetting). To this end, we have proposed an Efficient Anti-Forgetting Test-Time Adaptation (EATA) method which develops an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples for test-time entropy minimization. To alleviate forgetting, EATA introduces a Fisher regularizer estimated from test samples to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes. However, in EATA, the adopted entropy loss consistently assigns higher confidence to predictions even for samples that are underlying uncertain, leading to overconfident predictions. To tackle this, we further propose EATA with Calibration (EATA-C) to separately exploit the reducible model uncertainty and the inherent data uncertainty for calibrated TTA. Specifically, we measure the model uncertainty by the divergence between predictions from the full network and its sub-networks, on which we propose a divergence loss to encourage consistent predictions instead of overconfident ones. To further recalibrate prediction confidence, we utilize the disagreement among predicted labels as an indicator of the data uncertainty, and then devise a min-max entropy regularizer to selectively increase and decrease prediction confidence for different samples. Experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

| **[Hybrid Quantum-Classical Learning for Multiclass Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18161v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the challenge of improving multiclass image classification through quantum machine-learning techniques. It explores how the discarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical classifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit states after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain entangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is lost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the conventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully connected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately process measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are ensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a classical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to adapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing discarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid quantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Transferring Styles for Reduced Texture Bias and Improved Robustness in Semantic Segmentation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10239v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Designing Practical Models for Isolated Word Visual Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17894v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words, these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Doubl...</summary><p>Double-column format, 13 pages with references, 2 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[A Mixture of Exemplars Approach for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17093v6)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the early weaknesses identified in deep neural networks trained for image classification tasks was their inability to provide low confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that was significantly different from the in-distribution (ID) data used to train them. Representation learning, where neural networks are trained in specific ways that improve their ability to detect OOD examples, has emerged as a promising solution. However, these approaches require long training times and can add additional overhead to detect OOD examples. Recent developments in Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models$\unicode{x2013}$large networks trained on large and diverse datasets with self-supervised approaches$\unicode{x2013}$also show strong performance in OOD detection, and could address these challenges. This paper presents Mixture of Exemplars (MoLAR), an efficient approach to tackling OOD detection challenges that is designed to maximise the benefit of training a classifier with a high quality, frozen, pretrained foundation model backbone. MoLAR provides strong OOD detection performance when only comparing the similarity of OOD examples to the exemplars, a small set of images chosen to be representative of the dataset, leading to significantly reduced overhead for OOD detection inference over other methods that provide best performance when the full ID dataset is used. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved OOD detection performance of MoLAR in comparison to comparable approaches in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, and code is available at github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](http://github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars) |
| **[Accountability Attribution: Tracing Model Behavior to Training Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00175v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI systems are typically developed through multiple stages-pretraining, fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment, where each stage builds on the previous ones and updates the model in distinct ways. This raises a critical question of accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is responsible, and to what extent? We pose the accountability attribution problem for tracing model behavior back to specific stages of the model development process. To address this challenge, we propose a general framework that answers counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model's behavior have changed if the updates from a particular stage had not occurred? Within this framework, we introduce estimators that efficiently quantify stage effects without retraining the model, accounting for both the data and key aspects of model optimization dynamics, including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. We demonstrate that our approach successfully quantifies the accountability of each stage to the model's behavior. Based on the attribution results, our method can identify and remove spurious correlations learned during image classification and text toxicity detection tasks that were developed across multiple stages. Our approach provides a practical tool for model analysis and represents a significant step toward more accountable AI development.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Optimal Convolutional Transfer Learning Architectures for Breast Lesion Classification and ACL Tear Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17567v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images (RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that 1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50 pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of 0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast lesion classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge: severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness. Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for achieving these gains.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure | None |

In contrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent behavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated aspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent behavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of constituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent behavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer. Specifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined to create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit zero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an MNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer to as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior as a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image classification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that this work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into different models of intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at ALife 2025 as a talk</p></details> | None |

However, transformers are data hungry, and their ability to generalize is constrained compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets), especially when trained with limited data due to the absence of the built-in spatial inductive biases present in ConvNets. In this paper, we strive to optimally combine the strengths of both convolution and transformers for image classification tasks. Towards this end, we present a novel lightweight hybrid network that pairs Convolution with Transformers via Representation Learning Fusion and Multi-Level Feature Cross-Attention named CTRL-F. Our network comprises a convolution branch and a novel transformer module named multi-level feature cross-attention (MFCA). The MFCA module operates on multi-level feature representations obtained at different convolution stages. It processes small patch tokens and large patch tokens extracted from these multi-level feature representations via two separate transformer branches, where both branches communicate and exchange knowledge through cross-attention mechanism. We fuse the local responses acquired from the convolution path with the global responses acquired from the MFCA module using novel representation fusion techniques dubbed adaptive knowledge fusion (AKF) and collaborative knowledge fusion (CKF). Experiments demonstrate that our CTRL-F variants achieve state-of-the-art performance, whether trained from scratch on large data or even with low-data regime. For Instance, CTRL-F achieves top-1 accuracy of 82.24% and 99.91% when trained from scratch on Oxford-102 Flowers and PlantVillage datasets respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art models which showcase the robustness of our model on image classification tasks.

While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29], makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with significant communication savings.</p></details> | 78 Pages, 1 figure | None |

The source of our inspiration is biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification. Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.</p></details> |  | None |

VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications. These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.</p></details> | Presented in ISCS25 | None |

The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics, aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained medical image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

This survey presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration. Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters, which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task. Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across diverse data characteristics and distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Workshop artiFicial And bio-inspIred netwoRked intelliGence foR cOnstrained aUtoNomous Devices (FAIRGROUND). 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)</p></details> | None |

We employ high-capacity teacher models, including VGG19 and lightweight Vision Transformers (Visformer-S and AutoFormer-V2-T), to guide the training of a compact, hardware-aware student model derived from the OFA-595 supernet. Our approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000, covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the distilled student model maintains high classification performance with significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical, trustworthy medical AI solutions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust and Efficient Quantum Reservoir Computing with Discrete Time Crystal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15230v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in the NISQ era.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |

This study introduces a novel approach that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in computer vision and unstructured data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, proceeding into CanadianAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Seeing Further on the Shoulders of Giants: Knowledge Inheritance for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14707v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.</p></details> | Technical report | None |

In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

These approaches learn additional embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based IL in IOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV Workshops 2025</p></details> | None |

The quality of tongue surface segmentation significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by 96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool (available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available tongue image segmentation tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tongu...</summary><p>Tongue segmentation, data augmentation, synthetic data for AI training, prompt engineering, Segment Anything Model, knowledge distillation, tongue classification</p></details> | None |
| **[Graph Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14255v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust in performance across different training and architecture settings.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces an innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data. In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the regular GCN.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures | None |

Choosing the right backbone is crucial, especially for small datasets, since final performance depends heavily on the quality of the initial feature representations. While prior work has conducted benchmarks across various datasets to identify universal top-performing backbones, we demonstrate that backbone effectiveness is highly dataset-dependent, especially in low-data scenarios where no single backbone consistently excels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce dataset-specific backbone selection as a new research direction and investigate its practical viability in low-data regimes. Since exhaustive evaluation is computationally impractical for large backbone pools, we formalize Vision Backbone Efficient Selection (VIBES) as the problem of searching for high-performing backbones under computational constraints. We define the solution space, propose several heuristics, and demonstrate VIBES feasibility for low-data image classification by performing experiments on four diverse datasets. Our results show that even simple search strategies can find well-suited backbones within a pool of over $1300$ pretrained models, outperforming generic benchmark recommendations within just ten minutes of search time on a single GPU (NVIDIA RTX A5000).</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, Accepted at BMVC 2025</p></details> | None |

Our approach leverages the state transition parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in diverse SSM applications.</p></details> | under review | None |

Optical computing emerges as a promising paradigm to meet these challenges, whereas current optical computing architectures have limited versatility. Their applications are usually either constrained to a specialized domain or restricted to general-purpose matrix computation. Here, we implement a fully-programmable integrated photonic processor that can be configured to tackle both specific computational problems and general-purpose matrix computation. We achieve complete end-to-end control of the photonic processor by utilizing a self-developed integrated programmable optoelectronic computing platform. For domain-specific computing, our photonic processor can efficiently solve two kinds of NP-complete problems: subset sum problem (far more than 2^N different instances) and exact cover problem. For general-purpose computation, we experimentally demonstrate high-precision optical dot product and further realize accurate image edge detection and MNIST handwritten image classification task with an accuracy of 97%. Our work enhances the versatility and capability of optical computing architecture, paving the way for its practical application in future high-performance and complex computing scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Adversarial Transferability for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using 3D Structure-invariant Transformation and Weighted Intermediate Feature Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10459v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on DNNs. Numerous adversarial attack methods have been designed in the domain of natural images. However, different from natural images, HSIs contains high-dimensional rich spectral information, which presents new challenges for generating adversarial examples. Based on the specific characteristics of HSIs, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability of the adversarial examples for HSI classification using 3D structure-invariant transformation and weighted intermediate feature divergence. While keeping the HSIs structure invariant, the proposed method divides the image into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various transformations are applied on each block to increase input diversity and mitigate the overfitting to substitute models. Moreover, a weighted intermediate feature divergence loss is also designed by leveraging the differences between the intermediate features of original and adversarial examples. It constrains the perturbation direction by enlarging the feature maps of the original examples, and assigns different weights to different feature channels to destroy the features that have a greater impact on HSI classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed method achieve more effective adversarial transferability on three public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack performance even under defense strategies.</p></details> |  | None |

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50 baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50. In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Applications of Small Language Models in Medical Imaging Classification with a Focus on Prompt Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13378v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis establishes connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). Under specific conditions -- particularly when the noise is correlated -- the TD solution serves as a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we show that when our algorithm is applied with many commonly used loss functions -- such as those found in generalized linear models -- it corresponds to the application of a novel and generalized Bellman operator. We prove that this operator admits a unique fixed point, and based on this, we establish convergence guarantees for our generalized TD algorithm under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by JAIR.

| **[Preserve and Sculpt: Manifold-Aligned Fine-tuning of Vision-Language Models for Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12877v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown remarkable potential in few-shot image classification and led to numerous effective transfer learning strategies. These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting through parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints. However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning. Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
