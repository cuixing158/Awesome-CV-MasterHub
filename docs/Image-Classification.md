| **[Hypergraph Vision Transformers: Images are More than Nodes, More than Edges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08710v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in computer vision have highlighted the scalability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) across various tasks, yet challenges remain in balancing adaptability, computational efficiency, and the ability to model higher-order relationships. Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[UNEM: UNrolled Generalized EM for Transductive Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16739v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transductive few-shot learning has recently triggered wide attention in computer vision. Yet, current methods introduce key hyper-parameters, which control the prediction statistics of the test batches, such as the level of class balance, affecting performances significantly. Such hyper-parameters are empirically grid-searched over validation data, and their configurations may vary substantially with the target dataset and pre-training model, making such empirical searches both sub-optimal and computationally intractable. In this work, we advocate and introduce the unrolling paradigm, also referred to as "learning to optimize", in the context of few-shot learning, thereby learning efficiently and effectively a set of optimized hyper-parameters. Specifically, we unroll a generalization of the ubiquitous Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimizer into a neural network architecture, mapping each of its iterates to a layer and learning a set of key hyper-parameters over validation data. Our unrolling approach covers various statistical feature distributions and pre-training paradigms, including recent foundational vision-language models and standard vision-only classifiers. We report comprehensive experiments, which cover a breadth of fine-grained downstream image classification tasks, showing significant gains brought by the proposed unrolled EM algorithm over iterative variants. The achieved improvements reach up to 10% and 7.5% on vision-only and vision-language benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | None |
| **[An Early Experience with Confidential Computing Architecture for On-Device Model Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08508v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying machine learning (ML) models on user devices can improve privacy (by keeping data local) and reduce inference latency. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a practical solution for protecting proprietary models, yet existing TEE solutions have architectural constraints that hinder on-device model deployment. Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA), a new Arm extension, addresses several of these limitations and shows promise as a secure platform for on-device ML. In this paper, we evaluate the performance-privacy trade-offs of deploying models within CCA, highlighting its potential to enable confidential and efficient ML applications. Our evaluations show that CCA can achieve an overhead of, at most, 22% in running models of different sizes and applications, including image classification, voice recognition, and chat assistants. This performance overhead comes with privacy benefits; for example, our framework can successfully protect the model against membership inference attack by an 8.3% reduction in the adversary's success rate. To support further research and early adoption, we make our code and methodology publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 8th Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution (SysTEX 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[A Hybrid Fully Convolutional CNN-Transformer Model for Inherently Interpretable Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08481v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid CNN-ViT models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for medical image classification. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the model's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical image classification tasks using color fundus images. Our model not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to both black-box and interpretable models but also provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Expl-CNN-Transformer/.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FocalLens: Instruction Tuning Enables Zero-Shot Conditional Image Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08368v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual understanding is inherently contextual -- what we focus on in an image depends on the task at hand. For instance, given an image of a person holding a bouquet of flowers, we may focus on either the person such as their clothing, or the type of flowers, depending on the context of interest. Yet, most existing image encoding paradigms represent an image as a fixed, generic feature vector, overlooking the potential needs of prioritizing varying visual information for different downstream use cases. In this work, we introduce FocalLens, a conditional visual encoding method that produces different representations for the same image based on the context of interest, expressed flexibly through natural language. We leverage vision instruction tuning data and contrastively finetune a pretrained vision encoder to take natural language instructions as additional inputs for producing conditional image representations. Extensive experiments validate that conditional image representation from FocalLens better pronounce the visual features of interest compared to generic features produced by standard vision encoders like CLIP. In addition, we show FocalLens further leads to performance improvements on a range of downstream tasks including image-image retrieval, image classification, and image-text retrieval, with an average gain of 5 and 10 points on the challenging SugarCrepe and MMVP-VLM benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Embedding Byzantine Fault Tolerance into Federated Learning via Consistency Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10212v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given sufficient data from multiple edge devices, federated learning (FL) enables training a shared model without transmitting private data to a central server. However, FL is generally vulnerable to Byzantine attacks from compromised edge devices, which can significantly degrade the model performance. In this paper, we propose a intuitive plugin that can be integrated into existing FL techniques to achieve Byzantine-Resilience. Key idea is to generate virtual data samples and evaluate model consistency scores across local updates to effectively filter out compromised edge devices. By utilizing this scoring mechanism before the aggregation phase, the proposed plugin enables existing FL techniques to become robust against Byzantine attacks while maintaining their original benefits. Numerical results on medical image classification task validate that plugging the proposed approach into representative FL algorithms, effectively achieves Byzantine resilience. Furthermore, the proposed plugin maintains the original convergence properties of the base FL algorithms when no Byzantine attacks are present.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |
| **[Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes with Generative Modelling for Interpretable and Trustworthy Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00092v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prototypical-part methods, e.g., ProtoPNet, enhance interpretability in image recognition by linking predictions to training prototypes, thereby offering intuitive insights into their decision-making. Existing methods, which rely on a point-based learning of prototypes, typically face two critical issues: 1) the learned prototypes have limited representation power and are not suitable to detect Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs, reducing their decision trustworthiness; and 2) the necessary projection of the learned prototypes back into the space of training images causes a drastic degradation in the predictive performance. Furthermore, current prototype learning adopts an aggressive approach that considers only the most active object parts during training, while overlooking sub-salient object regions which still hold crucial classification information. In this paper, we present a new generative paradigm to learn prototype distributions, termed as Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes (MGProto). The distribution of prototypes from MGProto enables both interpretable image classification and trustworthy recognition of OoD inputs. The optimisation of MGProto naturally projects the learned prototype distributions back into the training image space, thereby addressing the performance degradation caused by prototype projection. Additionally, we develop a novel and effective prototype mining strategy that considers not only the most active but also sub-salient object parts. To promote model compactness, we further propose to prune MGProto by removing prototypes with low importance priors. Experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, and Oxford-IIIT Pets datasets show that MGProto achieves state-of-the-art image recognition and OoD detection performances, while providing encouraging interpretability results.</p></details> | IEEE TPAMI | None |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on Data Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05657v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data attribution aims to quantify the contribution of individual training data points to the outputs of an AI model, which has been used to measure the value of training data and compensate data providers. Given the impact on financial decisions and compensation mechanisms, a critical question arises concerning the adversarial robustness of data attribution methods. However, there has been little to no systematic research addressing this issue. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by detailing a threat model with clear assumptions about the adversary's goal and capabilities and proposing principled adversarial attack methods on data attribution. We present two methods, Shadow Attack and Outlier Attack, which generate manipulated datasets to inflate the compensation adversarially. The Shadow Attack leverages knowledge about the data distribution in the AI applications, and derives adversarial perturbations through "shadow training", a technique commonly used in membership inference attacks. In contrast, the Outlier Attack does not assume any knowledge about the data distribution and relies solely on black-box queries to the target model's predictions. It exploits an inductive bias present in many data attribution methods - outlier data points are more likely to be influential - and employs adversarial examples to generate manipulated datasets. Empirically, in image classification and text generation tasks, the Shadow Attack can inflate the data-attribution-based compensation by at least 200%, while the Outlier Attack achieves compensation inflation ranging from 185% to as much as 643%.

| **[Comparative Analysis of Different Methods for Classifying Polychromatic Sketches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08186v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification is a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly in domains humans are not accustomed to. As machine learning and artificial intelligence become more prominent, it is crucial these algorithms develop a sense of sight that is on par with or exceeds human ability. For this reason, we have collected, cleaned, and parsed a large dataset of hand-drawn doodles and compared multiple machine learning solutions to classify these images into 170 distinct categories. The best model we found achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 47.5%, significantly surpassing human performance on the dataset, which stands at 41%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pychop: Emulating Low-Precision Arithmetic in Numerical Methods and Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07835v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.

| **[CLIP meets DINO for Tuning Zero-Shot Classifier using Unlabeled Image Collections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19346v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text & visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual & textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFTer across 11 diverse image classification datasets.

| **[Identifying regions of interest in whole slide images of renal cell carcinoma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07313v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological images contain a huge amount of information, which can make diagnosis an extremely timeconsuming and tedious task. In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Augmentation Policy Optimization with LLM Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13453v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is a critical component of deep learning pipelines, enhancing model generalization by increasing dataset diversity. Traditional augmentation strategies rely on manually designed transformations, stochastic sampling, or automated search-based approaches. Although automated methods improve performance, they often require extensive computational resources and are tailored to specific datasets. In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided augmentation optimization strategy that refines augmentation policies based on model performance feedback. We introduce two approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where augmentation policies are selected by an LLM prior to training and iteratively refined across multiple training cycles, and (2) Adaptive LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where policies adapt in real-time based on performance metrics. This in-training approach eliminates the need for full model retraining before receiving LLM feedback, thereby reducing computational costs while improving performance. Our methodology employs an LLM to dynamically select augmentation transformations based on dataset characteristics, model architecture, and prior training outcomes. Unlike traditional search-based methods, our approach leverages the contextual knowledge of LLMs, particularly in specialized domains like medical imaging, to recommend augmentation strategies tailored to domain-specific data. We evaluate our approach on multiple domain-specific image classification datasets where augmentation is key to model robustness. Results show that LLM-guided augmentation optimization outperforms traditional methods, improving model accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating and adapting deep learning training workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 tables, 3 figures submitted for consideration to 2025 Medical Image Understanding and Analysis Conference (MIUA)</p></details> | None |
| **[Discovering Influential Neuron Path in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09046v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer models exhibit immense power yet remain opaque to human understanding, posing challenges and risks for practical applications. While prior research has attempted to demystify these models through input attribution and neuron role analysis, there's been a notable gap in considering layer-level information and the holistic path of information flow across layers. In this paper, we investigate the significance of influential neuron paths within vision Transformers, which is a path of neurons from the model input to output that impacts the model inference most significantly. We first propose a joint influence measure to assess the contribution of a set of neurons to the model outcome. And we further provide a layer-progressive neuron locating approach that efficiently selects the most influential neuron at each layer trying to discover the crucial neuron path from input to output within the target model. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method finding the most influential neuron path along which the information flows, over the existing baseline solutions. Additionally, the neuron paths have illustrated that vision Transformers exhibit some specific inner working mechanism for processing the visual information within the same image category. We further analyze the key effects of these neurons on the image classification task, showcasing that the found neuron paths have already preserved the model capability on downstream tasks, which may also shed some lights on real-world applications like model pruning.

| **[Fast Convex Optimization for Two-Layer ReLU Networks: Equivalent Model Classes and Cone Decompositions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01331v4)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop fast algorithms and robust software for convex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. Our work leverages a convex reformulation of the standard weight-decay penalized training problem as a set of group-$\ell_1$-regularized data-local models, where locality is enforced by polyhedral cone constraints. In the special case of zero-regularization, we show that this problem is exactly equivalent to unconstrained optimization of a convex "gated ReLU" network with non-singular gates. For problems with non-zero regularization, we show that convex gated ReLU models obtain data-dependent approximation bounds for the ReLU training problem. To optimize the convex reformulations, we develop an accelerated proximal gradient method and a practical augmented Lagrangian solver. We show that these approaches are faster than standard training heuristics for the non-convex problem, such as SGD, and outperform commercial interior-point solvers. Experimentally, we verify our theoretical results, explore the group-$\ell_1$ regularization path, and scale convex optimization for neural networks to image classification on MNIST and CIFAR-10.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fix p...</summary><p>Fix plotting bug in Figures 4,7,8, updated Theorem 3.3 and clarify its proof</p></details> | None |

Although single-view X-ray equipment is widely deployed, it struggles to accurately identify contraband in complex stacking scenarios due to strong viewpoint dependency and inadequate feature representation. To address this, we propose an innovative multi-scale interactive feature fusion framework tailored for dual-view X-ray security inspection image classification. The framework comprises three core modules: the Frequency Domain Interaction Module (FDIM) enhances frequency-domain features through Fourier transform; the Multi-Scale Cross-View Feature Enhancement (MSCFE) leverages cross-view attention mechanisms to strengthen feature interactions; and the Convolutional Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) efficiently fuses features by integrating channel attention with depthwise-separable convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple backbone architectures, particularly excelling in complex scenarios with occlusions and object stacking.</p></details> | <details><summary>I did...</summary><p>I did not obtain permission from the other authors, especially the corresponding author, to submit this manuscript, so I respectfully request its withdrawal</p></details> | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Siamese Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02549v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrast to fully-supervised models, self-supervised representation learning only needs a fraction of data to be labeled and often achieves the same or even higher downstream performance. The goal is to pre-train deep neural networks on a self-supervised task, making them able to extract meaningful features from raw input data afterwards. Previously, autoencoders and Siamese networks have been successfully employed as feature extractors for tasks such as image classification. However, both have their individual shortcomings and benefits. In this paper, we combine their complementary strengths by proposing a new method called SidAE (Siamese denoising autoencoder). Using an image classification downstream task, we show that our model outperforms two self-supervised baselines across multiple data sets and scenarios. Crucially, this includes conditions in which only a small amount of labeled data is available. Empirically, the Siamese component has more impact, but the denoising autoencoder is nevertheless necessary to improve performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, accepted at Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2024)</p></details> | None |

Our model enables effective generalization to new classes by simply replacing the memory contents, without the need for model retraining. Unlike traditional models that encode both world knowledge and task-specific skills into their weights during training, our model stores knowledge in the external memory of web-crawled image and text data. At inference time, the model dynamically selects relevant content from the memory based on the input image, allowing it to adapt to arbitrary classes by simply replacing the memory contents. The key differentiator that our learner meta-learns to perform classification tasks with noisy web data from unseen classes, resulting in robust performance across various classification scenarios.

| **[Federated Unlearning Made Practical: Seamless Integration via Negated Pseudo-Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05822v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The right to be forgotten is a fundamental principle of privacy-preserving regulations and extends to Machine Learning (ML) paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL). While FL enhances privacy by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data, trained models still retain the influence of training data. Federated Unlearning (FU) methods recently proposed often rely on impractical assumptions for real-world FL deployments, such as storing client update histories or requiring access to a publicly available dataset. To address these constraints, this paper introduces a novel method that leverages negated Pseudo-gradients Updates for Federated Unlearning (PUF). Our approach only uses standard client model updates, anyway employed during regular FL rounds, and interprets them as pseudo-gradients. When a client needs to be forgotten, we apply the negated of their pseudo-gradients, appropriately scaled, to the global model. Unlike state-of-the-art mechanisms, PUF seamlessly integrates with FL workflows, incurs no additional computational and communication overhead beyond standard FL rounds, and supports concurrent unlearning requests. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on two well-known benchmark image classification datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and a real-world medical imaging dataset for segmentation (ProstateMRI), using three different neural architectures: two residual networks and a vision transformer. The experimental results across various settings demonstrate that PUF achieves state-of-the-art forgetting effectiveness and recovery time, without relying on any additional assumptions, thus underscoring its practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Your Image Generator Is Your New Private Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04582v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools to synthetically produce training data, offering potential solutions to data scarcity and reducing labelling costs for downstream supervised deep learning applications. However, effectively leveraging text-conditioned image generation for building classifier training sets requires addressing key issues: constructing informative textual prompts, adapting generative models to specific domains, and ensuring robust performance. This paper proposes the Text-Conditioned Knowledge Recycling (TCKR) pipeline to tackle these challenges. TCKR combines dynamic image captioning, parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning, and Generative Knowledge Distillation techniques to create synthetic datasets tailored for image classification. The pipeline is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse image classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that models trained solely on TCKR-generated data achieve classification accuracies on par with (and in several cases exceeding) models trained on real images. Furthermore, the evaluation reveals that these synthetic-data-trained models exhibit substantially enhanced privacy characteristics: their vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks is significantly reduced, with the membership inference AUC lowered by 5.49 points on average compared to using real training data, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the performance-privacy trade-off. These findings indicate that high-fidelity synthetic data can effectively replace real data for training classifiers, yielding strong performance whilst simultaneously providing improved privacy protection as a valuable emergent property. The code and trained models are available in the accompanying open-source repository.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DefMamba: Deformable Visual State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05794v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, state space models (SSM), particularly Mamba, have attracted significant attention from scholars due to their ability to effectively balance computational efficiency and performance. However, most existing visual Mamba methods flatten images into 1D sequences using predefined scan orders, which results the model being less capable of utilizing the spatial structural information of the image during the feature extraction process. To address this issue, we proposed a novel visual foundation model called DefMamba. This model includes a multi-scale backbone structure and deformable mamba (DM) blocks, which dynamically adjust the scanning path to prioritize important information, thus enhancing the capture and processing of relevant input features. By combining a deformable scanning(DS) strategy, this model significantly improves its ability to learn image structures and detects changes in object details. Numerous experiments have shown that DefMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The code is open source on DefMamba.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |
| **[Neural Architecture Search: Two Constant Shared Weights Initialisations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04406v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last decade, zero-cost metrics have gained prominence in neural architecture search (NAS) due to their ability to evaluate architectures without training. These metrics are significantly faster and less computationally expensive than traditional NAS methods and provide insights into neural architectures' internal workings. This paper introduces epsinas, a novel zero-cost NAS metric that assesses architecture potential using two constant shared weight initialisations and the statistics of their outputs. We show that the dispersion of raw outputs, normalised by their average magnitude, strongly correlates with trained accuracy. This effect holds across image classification and language tasks on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and NAS-Bench-NLP. Our method requires no data labels, operates on a single minibatch, and eliminates the need for gradient computation, making it independent of training hyperparameters, loss metrics, and human annotations. It evaluates a network in a fraction of a GPU second and integrates seamlessly into existing NAS frameworks.

| **[Secure Diagnostics: Adversarial Robustness Meets Clinical Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05483v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for medical image classification often fail to generalize consistently in clinical practice due to violations of the i.i.d. assumption and opaque decision-making. This paper examines interpretability in deep neural networks fine-tuned for fracture detection by evaluating model performance against adversarial attack and comparing interpretability methods to fracture regions annotated by an orthopedic surgeon. Our findings prove that robust models yield explanations more aligned with clinically meaningful areas, indicating that robustness encourages anatomically relevant feature prioritization. We emphasize the value of interpretability for facilitating human-AI collaboration, in which models serve as assistants under a human-in-the-loop paradigm: clinically plausible explanations foster trust, enable error correction, and discourage reliance on AI for high-stakes decisions. This paper investigates robustness and interpretability as complementary benchmarks for bridging the gap between benchmark performance and safe, actionable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explaining Low Perception Model Competency with High-Competency Counterfactuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05254v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There exist many methods to explain how an image classification model generates its decision, but very little work has explored methods to explain why a classifier might lack confidence in its prediction. As there are various reasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this model to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is uncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could be made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this work, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low model competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures confidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate high-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD), Feature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent Gradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these methods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for low model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising methods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three methods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the inclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly increases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the cause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual images in explaining low perception model competency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Learning for Medical Image Classification: A Comprehensive Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05238v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The federated learning paradigm is wellsuited for the field of medical image analysis, as it can effectively cope with machine learning on isolated multicenter data while protecting the privacy of participating parties. However, current research on optimization algorithms in federated learning often focuses on limited datasets and scenarios, primarily centered around natural images, with insufficient comparative experiments in medical contexts. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms in the context of medical imaging. We conduct a fair comparison of classification models trained using various federated learning algorithms across multiple medical imaging datasets. Additionally, we evaluate system performance metrics, such as communication cost and computational efficiency, while considering different federated learning architectures. Our findings show that medical imaging datasets pose substantial challenges for current federated learning optimization algorithms. No single algorithm consistently delivers optimal performance across all medical federated learning scenarios, and many optimization algorithms may underperform when applied to these datasets. Our experiments provide a benchmark and guidance for future research and application of federated learning in medical imaging contexts. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and robust method that combines generative techniques using denoising diffusion probabilistic models with label smoothing to augment datasets, widely enhancing the performance of federated learning on classification tasks across various medical imaging datasets. Our code will be released on GitHub, offering a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for future federated learning studies in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Occam Gradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20194v8)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning neural network models must be large enough to adapt to their problem domain, while small enough to avoid overfitting training data during gradient descent. To balance these competing demands, overprovisioned deep learning models such as transformers are trained for a single epoch on large data sets, and hence inefficient with both computing resources and training data. In response to these inefficiencies, we exploit learning theory to derive Occam Gradient Descent, an algorithm that interleaves adaptive reduction of model size to minimize generalization error, with gradient descent on model weights to minimize fitting error. In contrast, traditional gradient descent greedily minimizes fitting error without regard to generalization error. Our algorithm simultaneously descends the space of weights and topological size of any neural network without modification. With respect to loss, compute and model size, our experiments show (a) on image classification benchmarks, linear and convolutional neural networks trained with Occam Gradient Descent outperform traditional gradient descent with or without post-train pruning; (b) on a range of tabular data classification tasks, neural networks trained with Occam Gradient Descent outperform traditional gradient descent, as well as Random Forests; (c) on natural language transformers, Occam Gradient Descent outperforms traditional gradient descent.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by these advancements, the remote sensing community has begun to adopt VLMs for remote sensing vision-language tasks, including scene understanding, image captioning, and visual question answering. However, existing remote sensing VLMs typically rely on closed-set scene understanding and focus on generic scene descriptions, yet lack the ability to incorporate external knowledge. This limitation hinders their capacity for semantic reasoning over complex or context-dependent queries that involve domain-specific or world knowledge. To address these challenges, we first introduced a multimodal Remote Sensing World Knowledge (RSWK) dataset, which comprises high-resolution satellite imagery and detailed textual descriptions for 14,141 well-known landmarks from 175 countries, integrating both remote sensing domain knowledge and broader world knowledge. Building upon this dataset, we proposed a novel Remote Sensing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RS-RAG) framework, which consists of two key components. The Multi-Modal Knowledge Vector Database Construction module encodes remote sensing imagery and associated textual knowledge into a unified vector space. The Knowledge Retrieval and Response Generation module retrieves and re-ranks relevant knowledge based on image and/or text queries, and incorporates the retrieved content into a knowledge-augmented prompt to guide the VLM in producing contextually grounded responses. We validated the effectiveness of our approach on three representative vision-language tasks, including image captioning, image classification, and visual question answering, where RS-RAG significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MSCPT: Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification with Multi-scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11505v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for the weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT.

Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence. To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

ZL learning faces the challenge of effectivelytransferring semantic information of unseen categories in multi-modal knowledgegraph (MMKG) embedding representation learning. In this paper, we proposeZSLLM, a framework for zero-shot embedding learning of MMKGs using largelanguage models (LLMs). We leverage textual modality information of unseencategories as prompts to fully utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enablingsemantic information transfer across different modalities for unseen categories.Through model-based learning, the embedding representation of unseen cate-gories in MMKG is enhanced.

This vulnerability pose significant risks in high-stakes applications such as autonomous vehicles, security surveillance, and safety-critical inspection systems. While the existing literature extensively covers adversarial attacks in image classification, comprehensive analyses of such attacks on object detection systems remain limited. This paper presents a novel taxonomic framework for categorizing adversarial attacks specific to object detection architectures, synthesizes existing robustness metrics, and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art attack methodologies on popular object detection models, including both traditional detectors and modern detectors with vision-language pretraining. Through rigorous analysis of open-source attack implementations and their effectiveness across diverse detection architectures, we derive key insights into attack characteristics. Furthermore, we delineate critical research gaps and emerging challenges to guide future investigations in securing object detection systems against adversarial threats. Our findings establish a foundation for developing more robust detection models while highlighting the urgent need for standardized evaluation protocols in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> | None |

Recent research involved knowledge from texts with a text-to-image model to generate in-domain training images in zero-shot scenarios. However, existing methods heavily rely on simple prompt strategies, limiting the diversity of synthetic training images, thus leading to inferior performance compared to real images. In this paper, we propose AttrSyn, which leverages large language models to generate attributed prompts. These prompts allow for the generation of more diverse attributed synthetic images. Experiments for zero-shot domain-specific image classification on two fine-grained datasets show that training with synthetic images generated by AttrSyn significantly outperforms CLIP's zero-shot classification under most situations and consistently surpasses simple prompt strategies.</p></details> |  | None |

To better adapt to ground object distributions and achieve adaptive dynamic feature responses while skipping redundant information, this paper proposes a Spatial-Geometry Enhanced 3D Dynamic Snake Network (SG-DSCNet) based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model. The network employs Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSCConv), which introduces deformable offsets to enhance kernel flexibility through constrained self-learning, thereby improving regional perception of ground objects. Additionally, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that generates multiple morphological kernel templates from DSCConv to observe target structures from different perspectives and achieve efficient feature fusion through summarizing key characteristics. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus more flexibly on critical spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on fixed receptive fields of single static kernels. The DSC module enhances model representation capability through dynamic kernel aggregation without increasing network depth or width. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral classification methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Based on this encoding method, we implement a convolutional neural network for handwritten image classification over encryption. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to perform homomorphic multiplication, the main idea behind it, in a simple version, is to encrypt matrix $A$ and the transpose of matrix $B$ into two ciphertexts respectively. With additional operations, the homomorphic matrix multiplication can be calculated over encrypted matrices efficiently. For the convolution operation, we in advance span each convolution kernel to a matrix space of the same size as the input image so as to generate several ciphertexts, each of which is later used together with the ciphertext encrypting input images for calculating some of the final convolution results. We accumulate all these intermediate results and thus complete the convolution operation. In a public cloud with 40 vCPUs, our convolutional neural network implementation on the MNIST testing dataset takes $\sim$ 287 seconds to compute ten likelihoods of 32 encrypted images of size $28 \times 28$ simultaneously. The data owner only needs to upload one ciphertext ($\sim 19.8$ MB) encrypting these 32 images to the public cloud.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The encoding method we proposed in this work, $\texttt{Volley Revolver}$, is particularly tailored for privacy-preserving neural networks.

| **[MASS: MoErging through Adaptive Subspace Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05342v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has recently emerged as a lightweight alternative to ensembling, combining multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of parameters with no additional training overhead. Yet, existing merging methods fall short of matching the full accuracy of separately fine-tuned endpoints. We present MASS (MoErging through Adaptive Subspace Selection), a new approach that closes this gap by unifying multiple fine-tuned models while retaining near state-of-the-art performance across tasks. Building on the low-rank decomposition of per-task updates, MASS stores only the most salient singular components for each task and merges them into a shared model. At inference time, a non-parametric, data-free router identifies which subspace (or combination thereof) best explains an input's intermediate features and activates the corresponding task-specific block. This procedure is fully training-free and introduces only a two-pass inference overhead plus a ~2 storage factor compared to a single pretrained model, irrespective of the number of tasks. We evaluate MASS on CLIP-based image classification using ViT-B-16, ViT-B-32 and ViT-L-14 for benchmarks of 8, 14 and 20 tasks respectively, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Most notably, MASS recovers up to ~98% of the average accuracy of individual fine-tuned models, making it a practical alternative to ensembling at a fraction of the storage cost.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing explainability approaches often sacrifice accuracy and lack quantifiable measures of prediction uncertainty. In this study, we introduce Conformal Prediction for Interpretable Neural Networks (CONFINE), a versatile framework that generates prediction sets with statistically robust uncertainty estimates instead of point predictions to enhance model transparency and reliability. CONFINE not only provides example-based explanations and confidence estimates for individual predictions but also boosts accuracy by up to 3.6%. We define a new metric, correct efficiency, to evaluate the fraction of prediction sets that contain precisely the correct label and show that CONFINE achieves correct efficiency of up to 3.3% higher than the original accuracy, matching or exceeding prior methods. CONFINE's marginal and class-conditional coverages attest to its validity across tasks spanning medical image classification to language understanding. Being adaptable to any pre-trained classifier, CONFINE marks a significant advance towards transparent and trustworthy deep learning applications in critical domains.</p></details> |  | None |

I examine how LIME and SHAP (model-agnostic methods) differ from Grad-CAM and Guided Backpropagation (model-specific methods) when interpreting ResNet50 predictions across diverse image categories. Through extensive testing with various species from dogs and birds to insects I found that each method reveals different aspects of the models decision-making process. Model-agnostic techniques provide broader feature attribution that works across different architectures, while model-specific approaches excel at highlighting precise activation regions with greater computational efficiency. My analysis shows there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution for model interpretability. Instead, combining multiple XAI methods offers the most comprehensive understanding of complex models particularly valuable in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and financial services where transparency is crucial. This comparative framework provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate interpretability techniques based on specific application needs and computational constraints.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Towards an Optimal Bound for the Interleaving Distance on Mapper Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03865v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapper graphs are a widely used tool in topological data analysis and visualization. They can be viewed as discrete approximations of Reeb graphs, offering insight into the shape and connectivity of complex data. Given a high-dimensional point cloud $\mathbb{X}$ equipped with a function $f: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{R}$, a mapper graph provides a summary of the topological structure of $\mathbb{X}$ induced by $f$, where each node represents a local neighborhood, and edges connect nodes whose corresponding neighborhoods overlap. Our focus is the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, arising from a discretization of the version for Reeb graphs, which is NP-hard to compute. This distance quantifies the similarity between two mapper graphs by measuring the extent to which they must be ``stretched" to become comparable. Recent work introduced a loss function that provides an upper bound on the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, which evaluates how far a given assignment is from being a true interleaving. Finding the loss is computationally tractable, offering a practical way to estimate the distance. In this paper, we employ a categorical formulation of mapper graphs and develop the first framework for computing the associated loss function. Since the quality of the bound depends on the chosen assignment, we optimize this loss function by formulating the problem of finding the best assignment as an integer linear programming problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our optimization, we apply it to small mapper graphs where the interleaving distance is known, demonstrating that the optimized upper bound successfully matches the interleaving distance in these cases. Additionally, we conduct an experiment on the MPEG-7 dataset, computing the pairwise optimal loss on a collection of mapper graphs derived from images and leveraging the distance bound for image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite their effectiveness, they lack interpretability, as they are unable to explain or justify their results. To address the challenge of interpretable image classification, this paper introduces a novel framework, named Interpretable Intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (I2FCMs).Intuitionistic FCMs (iFCMs) have been proposed as an extension of FCMs offering a natural mechanism to assess the quality of their output through the estimation of hesitancy, a concept resembling human hesitation in decision making. In the context of image classification, hesitancy is considered as a degree of unconfidence with which an image is categorized to a class. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time iFCMs are applied for image classification. Further novel contributions of the introduced framework include the following: a) a feature extraction process focusing on the most informative image regions; b) a learning algorithm for automatic data-driven determination of the intuitionistic fuzzy interconnections of the iFCM, thereby reducing human intervention in the definition of the graph structure; c) an inherently interpretable classification approach based on image contents, providing understandable explanations of its predictions, using linguistic terms. Furthermore, the proposed I2FCM framework can be applied to DL models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), rendering them interpretable. The effectiveness of I2FCM is evaluated on publicly available datasets, and the results confirm that it can provide enhanced classification performance, while providing interpretable inferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible journal publication</p></details> | None |

Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches using adapters consisting of small learnable layers have emerged as an alternative to FFT, achieving comparable performance while maintaining high training efficiency. However, the inflexibility of the adapter with respect to input instances limits its capability of learning task-specific information in diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel PEFT approach, input-Conditioned transFormer, termed iConFormer, that leverages a dynamic adapter conditioned on the input instances. To secure flexible learning ability on input instances in various downstream tasks, we introduce an input-Conditioned Network (iCoN) in the dynamic adapter that enables instance-level feature transformation. To be specific, iCoN generates channel-wise convolutional kernels for each feature and transform it using adaptive convolution process to effectively capture task-specific and fine-grained details tailor to downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that by tuning just 1.6% to 2.8% of the Transformer backbone parameters, iConFormer achieves performance comparable to FFT in monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, while outperforming it in image classification and instance segmentation. Also, the proposed method consistently outperforms recent PEFT methods for all the tasks mentioned above.</p></details> |  | None |

The core of this task involves distinguishing subtle morphological variations within the same broad category of gigapixel-resolution images, which presents a significant challenge. While the multi-instance learning (MIL) paradigm alleviates the computational burden of WSIs, existing MIL methods often overlook hierarchical label correlations, treating fine-grained classification as a flat multi-class classification task. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel hierarchical multi-instance learning (HMIL) framework. By facilitating on the hierarchical alignment of inherent relationships between different hierarchy of labels at instance and bag level, our approach provides a more structured and informative learning process. Specifically, HMIL incorporates a class-wise attention mechanism that aligns hierarchical information at both the instance and bag levels. Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability for fine-grained classification and a curriculum-based dynamic weighting module to adaptively balance the hierarchical feature during training. Extensive experiments on our large-scale cytology cervical cancer (CCC) dataset and two public histology datasets, BRACS and PANDA, demonstrate the state-of-the-art class-wise and overall performance of our HMIL framework.

However, the existing literature primarily focuses on regression tasks while neglecting classification aspects. In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach for interval-valued time series classification. Specifically, we represent interval-valued time series using convex combinations of upper and lower bounds of intervals and transform these representations into images based on point-valued time series imaging methods. We utilize a fine-grained image classification neural network to classify these images, to achieve the goal of classifying the original interval-valued time series. This proposed method is applicable to both univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series. On the optimization front, we treat the convex combination coefficients as learnable parameters similar to the parameters of the neural network and provide an efficient estimation method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). On the theoretical front, under specific conditions, we establish a margin-based multiclass generalization bound for generic CNNs composed of basic blocks involving convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Through simulation studies and real data applications, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and compare its performance against a wide range of point-valued time series classification methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HQViT: Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformer for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02730v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have revolutionized the landscape of deep learning. In computer vision domain, Vision Transformer demonstrates remarkable performance on par with or even surpassing that of convolutional neural networks. However, the quadratic computational complexity of its self-attention mechanism poses challenges for classical computing, making model training with high-dimensional input data, e.g., images, particularly expensive. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformer (HQViT), that leverages the principles of quantum computing to accelerate model training while enhancing model performance. HQViT introduces whole-image processing with amplitude encoding to better preserve global image information without additional positional encoding. By leveraging quantum computation on the most critical steps and selectively handling other components in a classical way, we lower the cost of quantum resources for HQViT. The qubit requirement is minimized to $O(log_2N)$ and the number of parameterized quantum gates is only $O(log_2d)$, making it well-suited for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. By offloading the computationally intensive attention coefficient matrix calculation to the quantum framework, HQViT reduces the classical computational load by $O(T^2d)$. Extensive experiments across various computer vision datasets demonstrate that HQViT outperforms existing models, achieving a maximum improvement of up to $10.9\%$ (on the MNIST 10-classification task) over the state of the art.

| **[Xpikeformer: Hybrid Analog-Digital Hardware Acceleration for Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08794v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of neuromorphic computing and transformers through spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers a promising path to energy-efficient sequence modeling, with the potential to overcome the energy-intensive nature of the artificial neural network (ANN)-based transformers. However, the algorithmic efficiency of SNN-based transformers cannot be fully exploited on GPUs due to architectural incompatibility. This paper introduces Xpikeformer, a hybrid analog-digital hardware architecture designed to accelerate SNN-based transformer models. The architecture integrates analog in-memory computing (AIMC) for feedforward and fully connected layers, and a stochastic spiking attention (SSA) engine for efficient attention mechanisms. We detail the design, implementation, and evaluation of Xpikeformer, demonstrating significant improvements in energy consumption and computational efficiency. Through image classification tasks and wireless communication symbol detection tasks, we show that Xpikeformer can achieve inference accuracy comparable to the GPU implementation of ANN-based transformers. Evaluations reveal that Xpikeformer achieves $13\times$ reduction in energy consumption at approximately the same throughput as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital accelerator for ANN-based transformers. Additionally, Xpikeformer achieves up to $1.9\times$ energy reduction compared to the optimal digital ASIC projection of SOTA SNN-based transformers.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Geometric Median Matching for Robust k-Subset Selection from Noisy Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00564v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data pruning -- the combinatorial task of selecting a small and representative subset from a large dataset, is crucial for mitigating the enormous computational costs associated with training data-hungry modern deep learning models at scale. Since large scale data collections are invariably noisy, developing data pruning strategies that remain robust even in the presence of corruption is critical in practice. However, existing data pruning methods often fail under high corruption rates due to their reliance on empirical mean estimation, which is highly sensitive to outliers. In response, we propose Geometric Median (GM) Matching, a novel k-subset selection strategy that leverages Geometric Median -- a robust estimator with an optimal breakdown point of 1/2; to enhance resilience against noisy data. Our method iteratively selects a k-subset such that the mean of the subset approximates the GM of the (potentially) noisy dataset, ensuring robustness even under arbitrary corruption. We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that GM Matching enjoys an improved O(1/k) convergence rate -- a quadratic improvement over random sampling, even under arbitrary corruption. Extensive experiments across image classification and image generation tasks demonstrate that GM Matching consistently outperforms existing pruning approaches, particularly in high-corruption settings and at high pruning rates; making it a strong baseline for robust data pruning.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms have traditionally relied on fixed rules and pre-defined building blocks. The Large Language Model (LLM)-Guided Evolution (GE) framework transformed this approach by incorporating LLMs to directly modify model source code for image classification algorithms on CIFAR data and intelligently guide mutations and crossovers. A key element of LLM-GE is the "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique, which establishes feedback loops, allowing LLMs to refine their decisions iteratively based on how previous operations performed. In this study, we perform NAS for object detection by improving LLM-GE to modify the architecture of You Only Look Once (YOLO) models to enhance performance on the KITTI dataset. Our approach intelligently adjusts the design and settings of YOLO to find the optimal algorithms against objective such as detection accuracy and speed. We show that LLM-GE produced variants with significant performance improvements, such as an increase in Mean Average Precision from 92.5% to 94.5%. This result highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of LLM-GE on real-world challenges, offering a novel paradigm for automated machine learning that combines LLM-driven reasoning with evolutionary strategies.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework by formulating heterogeneous FL as a hierarchical optimization problem. This new framework captures both local and global training process through a bilevel formulation and is capable of the following: (i) addressing client heterogeneity through a personalized learning framework; (ii) capturing pre-training process on server's side; (iii) updating global model through nonstandard aggregation; (iv) allowing for nonidentical local steps; and (v) capturing clients' local constraints. We design and analyze an implicit zeroth-order FL method (ZO-HFL), provided with nonasymptotic convergence guarantees for both the server-agent and the individual client-agents, and asymptotic guarantees for both the server-agent and client-agents in an almost sure sense. Notably, our method does not rely on standard assumptions in heterogeneous FL, such as the bounded gradient dissimilarity condition. We implement our method on image classification tasks and compare with other methods under different heterogeneous settings.</p></details> |  | None |

The TM is an emerging machine learning algorithm founded on propositional logic, utilizing sub-pattern recognition expressions called clauses. The accelerator implements the coalesced TM version with convolution, and classifies booleanized images of 28$\times$28 pixels with 10 categories. A configuration with 128 clauses is used in a highly parallel architecture. Fast clause evaluation is achieved by keeping all clause weights and Tsetlin automata (TA) action signals in registers. The chip is implemented in a 65 nm low-leakage CMOS technology, and occupies an active area of 2.7 mm$^2$. At a clock frequency of 27.8 MHz, the accelerator achieves 60.3k classifications per second, and consumes 8.6 nJ per classification. This demonstrates the energy-efficiency of the TM, which was the main motivation for developing this chip. The latency for classifying a single image is 25.4 $\mu$s which includes system timing overhead. The accelerator achieves 97.42%, 84.54% and 82.55% test accuracies for the datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Kuzushiji-MNIST, respectively, matching the TM software models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we establish two key principles for AIGI detection through systematic analysis: \textbf{(1) All Patches Matter:} Unlike conventional image classification where discriminative features concentrate on object-centric regions, each patch in AIGIs inherently contains synthetic artifacts due to the uniform generation process, suggesting that every patch serves as an important artifact source for detection. \textbf{(2) More Patches Better}: Leveraging distributed artifacts across more patches improves detection robustness by capturing complementary forensic evidence and reducing over-reliance on specific patches, thereby enhancing robustness and generalization. However, our counterfactual analysis reveals an undesirable phenomenon: naively trained detectors often exhibit a \textbf{Few-Patch Bias}, discriminating between real and synthetic images based on minority patches. We identify \textbf{Lazy Learner} as the root cause: detectors preferentially learn conspicuous artifacts in limited patches while neglecting broader artifact distributions. To address this bias, we propose the \textbf{P}anoptic \textbf{P}atch \textbf{L}earning (PPL) framework, involving: (1) Random Patch Replacement that randomly substitutes synthetic patches with real counterparts to compel models to identify artifacts in underutilized regions, encouraging the broader use of more patches; (2) Patch-wise Contrastive Learning that enforces consistent discriminative capability across all patches, ensuring uniform utilization of all patches. Extensive experiments across two different settings on several benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[What is Left After Distillation? How Knowledge Transfer Impacts Fairness and Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08407v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Distillation is a commonly used Deep Neural Network (DNN) compression method, which often maintains overall generalization performance. However, we show that even for balanced image classification datasets, such as CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet, as many as 41% of the classes are statistically significantly affected by distillation when comparing class-wise accuracy (i.e. class bias) between a teacher/distilled student or distilled student/non-distilled student model. Changes in class bias are not necessarily an undesirable outcome when considered outside of the context of a model's usage. Using two common fairness metrics, Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) and Equalized Odds Difference (EOD) on models trained with the CelebA, Trifeature, and HateXplain datasets, our results suggest that increasing the distillation temperature improves the distilled student model's fairness, and the distilled student fairness can even surpass the fairness of the teacher model at high temperatures. Additionally, we examine individual fairness, ensuring similar instances receive similar predictions. Our results confirm that higher temperatures also improve the distilled student model's individual fairness. This study highlights the uneven effects of distillation on certain classes and its potentially significant role in fairness, emphasizing that caution is warranted when using distilled models for sensitive application domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), March 2024. https://openreview.net/forum?id=xBbj46Y2fN</p></details> | None |

However, they often encounter challenges related to computational complexity and overfitting. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach that leverages polygonal representations of images using dominant points or contour coordinates. By transforming input images into these compact forms, our method significantly reduces computational requirements, accelerates training, and conserves resources making it suitable for real time and resource constrained applications. These representations inherently capture essential image features while filtering noise, providing a natural regularization effect that mitigates overfitting. The resulting lightweight models achieve performance comparable to state of the art methods using full resolution images while enabling deployment on edge devices. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing complexity, improving generalization, and facilitating edge computing applications. This work demonstrates the potential of polygonal representations in advancing efficient and scalable deep learning solutions for real world scenarios.

However, their efficient implementation strategy has not been comprehensively studied, hence limiting SNN deployments for edge AI systems. Toward this, we propose a design methodology to enable efficient SNN processing on commodity neuromorphic processors. To do this, we first study the key characteristics of targeted neuromorphic hardware (e.g., memory and compute budgets), and leverage this information to perform compatibility analysis for network selection. Afterward, we employ a mapping strategy for efficient SNN implementation on the targeted processor. Furthermore, we incorporate an efficient on-chip learning mechanism to update the systems' knowledge for adapting to new input classes and dynamic environments. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology leads the system to achieve low latency of inference (i.e., less than 50ms for image classification, less than 200ms for real-time object detection in video streaming, and less than 1ms in keyword recognition) and low latency of on-chip learning (i.e., less than 2ms for keyword recognition), while incurring less than 250mW of processing power and less than 15mJ of energy consumption across the respective different applications and scenarios. These results show the potential of the proposed methodology in enabling efficient edge AI systems for diverse application use-cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025 in Rome, Italy</p></details> | None |
| **[Impact of Data Duplication on Deep Neural Network-Based Image Classifiers: Robust vs. Standard Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00638v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy and robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks are significantly influenced by factors such as training data quality, model architecture, the training process, and the deployment environment. In recent years, duplicated data in training sets, especially in language models, has attracted considerable attention. It has been shown that deduplication enhances both training performance and model accuracy in language models. While the importance of data quality in training image classifier Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is widely recognized, the impact of duplicated images in the training set on model generalization and performance has received little attention. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a comprehensive study on the effect of duplicates in image classification. Our analysis indicates that the presence of duplicated images in the training set not only negatively affects the efficiency of model training but also may result in lower accuracy of the image classifier. This negative impact of duplication on accuracy is particularly evident when duplicated data is non-uniform across classes or when duplication, whether uniform or non-uniform, occurs in the training set of an adversarially trained model. Even when duplicated samples are selected in a uniform way, increasing the amount of duplication does not lead to a significant improvement in accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data-Free Group-Wise Fully Quantized Winograd Convolution via Learnable Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19867v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the revolutionary breakthroughs of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for complex vision and downstream tasks, their extremely high computational and storage costs limit their usability. Quantization of diffusion models has been explored in recent works to reduce compute costs and memory bandwidth usage. To further improve inference time, fast convolution algorithms such as Winograd can be used for convolution layers, which account for a significant portion of computations in diffusion models. However, the significant quality loss of fully quantized Winograd using existing coarser-grained post-training quantization methods, combined with the complexity and cost of finetuning the Winograd transformation matrices for such large models to recover quality, makes them unsuitable for large-scale foundation models. Motivated by the presence of a large range of values in them, we investigate the impact of finer-grained group-wise quantization in quantizing diffusion models. While group-wise quantization can largely handle the fully quantized Winograd convolution, it struggles to deal with the large distribution imbalance in a sizable portion of the Winograd domain computation. To reduce range differences in the Winograd domain, we propose finetuning only the scale parameters of the Winograd transform matrices without using any domain-specific training data. Because our method does not depend on any training data, the generalization performance of quantized diffusion models is safely guaranteed. For text-to-image generation task, the 8-bit fully-quantized diffusion model with Winograd provides near-lossless quality (FID and CLIP scores) in comparison to the full-precision model. For image classification, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Winograd PTQ method by 1.62% and 2.56% in top-1 ImageNet accuracy on ResNet18 and ResNet-34, respectively, with Winograd F(6, 3).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

A critical challenge in DP-SGD is selecting the optimal clipping threshold C, which involves balancing the trade-off between clipping bias and noise magnitude, incurring substantial privacy and computing overhead during hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Clipping DP-SGD (DC-SGD), a framework that leverages differentially private histograms to estimate gradient norm distributions and dynamically adjust the clipping threshold C. Our framework includes two novel mechanisms: DC-SGD-P and DC-SGD-E. DC-SGD-P adjusts the clipping threshold based on a percentile of gradient norms, while DC-SGD-E minimizes the expected squared error of gradients to optimize C. These dynamic adjustments significantly reduce the burden of hyperparameter tuning C. The extensive experiments on various deep learning tasks, including image classification and natural language processing, show that our proposed dynamic algorithms achieve up to 9 times acceleration on hyperparameter tuning than DP-SGD. And DC-SGD-E can achieve an accuracy improvement of 10.62% on CIFAR10 than DP-SGD under the same privacy budget of hyperparameter tuning. We conduct rigorous theoretical privacy and convergence analyses, showing that our methods seamlessly integrate with the Adam optimizer. Our results highlight the robust performance and efficiency of DC-SGD, offering a practical solution for differentially private deep learning with reduced computational overhead and enhanced privacy guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics & Security</p></details> | None |

In this paper, motivated by the emerging technologies of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) that offer programmable propagation of wireless signals, either through controllable reflections or diffractions, we optimize the RIS/SIM-enabled smart wireless environment as a means of over-the-air computing, resembling the operations of DNN layers. We propose a framework of Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Networks (MINNs) for EI, presenting its modeling, training through a backpropagation variation for fading channels, and deployment aspects. The overall end-to-end DNN architecture is general enough to admit RIS and SIM devices, through controllable reconfiguration before each transmission or fixed configurations after training, while both channel-aware and channel-agnostic transceivers are considered. Our numerical evaluation showcases metasurfaces to be instrumental in performing image classification under link budgets that impede conventional communications or metasurface-free systems. It is demonstrated that our MINN framework can significantly simplify EI requirements, achieving near-optimal performance with $50~$dB lower testing signal-to-noise ratio compared to training, even without transceiver channel knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for journal publication</p></details> | None |

The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches.

| **[NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Back-propagation or Forward-propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24322v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a gradient term at each layer by back-propagating the error signal from the output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each layer builds on the representation of the layer below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top layers of the model, while features on lower layers are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each layer independently learns to denoise a noisy target. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of gradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each layer beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm which achieves superior accuracy, is easier to use and computationally more efficient compared to other existing back-propagation-free methods. By departing from the traditional gradient based learning paradigm, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the theoretical foundations underlying CLIP's strong generalization remain unclear. In this work, we address this gap by proposing the Cross-modal Information Bottleneck (CIB) framework. CIB offers a principled interpretation of CLIP's contrastive learning objective as an implicit Information Bottleneck optimization. Under this view, the model maximizes shared cross-modal information while discarding modality-specific redundancies, thereby preserving essential semantic alignment across modalities. Building on this insight, we introduce a Cross-modal Information Bottleneck Regularization (CIBR) method that explicitly enforces these IB principles during training. CIBR introduces a penalty term to discourage modality-specific redundancy, thereby enhancing semantic alignment between image and text features. We validate CIBR on extensive vision-language benchmarks, including zero-shot classification across seven diverse image datasets and text-image retrieval on MSCOCO and Flickr30K. The results show consistent performance gains over standard CLIP. These findings provide the first theoretical understanding of CLIP's generalization through the IB lens. They also demonstrate practical improvements, offering guidance for future cross-modal representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PixelCAM: Pixel Class Activation Mapping for Histology Image Classification and ROI Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24135v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) methods allow training models to classify images and localize ROIs. WSOL only requires low-cost image-class annotations yet provides a visually interpretable classifier, which is important in histology image analysis. Standard WSOL methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods to produce spatial localization maps according to a single- or two-step strategy. While both strategies have made significant progress, they still face several limitations with histology images. Single-step methods can easily result in under- or over-activation due to the limited visual ROI saliency in histology images and the limited localization cues. They also face the well-known issue of asynchronous convergence between classification and localization tasks. The two-step approach is sub-optimal because it is tied to a frozen classifier, limiting the capacity for localization. Moreover, these methods also struggle when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. In this paper, a multi-task approach for WSOL is introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to address the asynchronous convergence problem. In particular, localization is performed in the pixel-feature space of an image encoder that is shared with classification. This allows learning discriminant features and accurate delineation of foreground/background regions to support ROI localization and image classification. We propose PixelCAM, a cost-effective foreground/background pixel-wise classifier in the pixel-feature space that allows for spatial object localization. PixelCAM is trained using pixel pseudo-labels collected from a pretrained WSOL model. Both image and pixel-wise classifiers are trained simultaneously using standard gradient descent. In addition, our pixel classifier can easily be integrated into CNN- and transformer-based architectures without any modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 20 figures, Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL 2025)</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes a method to learn an effective representation between previous and newly encountered class prototypes. We propose a prototypical network with a Bayesian learning-driven contrastive loss (BLCL), tailored specifically for class-incremental learning scenarios. We introduce a contrastive loss that incorporates novel classes into the latent representation by reducing intra-class and increasing inter-class distance. Our approach dynamically adapts the balance between the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions with a Bayesian learning technique. Experimental results conducted on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet100 datasets for image classification and images of a GNSS-based dataset for interference classification validate the efficacy of our method, showcasing its superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

In particular, when the teacher's modalities include the student's, additional complementary information can be exploited to improve knowledge transfer. In supervised image classification, image datasets typically include class labels that represent high-level concepts, suggesting a natural avenue to incorporate textual cues for crossmodal KD. However, these labels rarely capture the deeper semantic structures in real-world visuals and can lead to label leakage if used directly as inputs, ultimately limiting KD performance. To address these issues, we propose a multi-teacher crossmodal KD framework that integrates CLIP image embeddings with learnable WordNet-relaxed text embeddings under a hierarchical loss. By avoiding direct use of exact class names and instead using semantically richer WordNet expansions, we mitigate label leakage and introduce more diverse textual cues. Experiments show that this strategy significantly boosts student performance, whereas noisy or overly precise text embeddings hinder distillation efficiency. Interpretability analyses confirm that WordNet-relaxed prompts encourage heavier reliance on visual features over textual shortcuts, while still effectively incorporating the newly introduced textual cues. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or second-best results on six public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing crossmodal KD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[InPK: Infusing Prior Knowledge into Prompt for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19777v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning has become a popular strategy for adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to zero/few-shot visual recognition tasks. Some prompting techniques introduce prior knowledge due to its richness, but when learnable tokens are randomly initialized and disconnected from prior knowledge, they tend to overfit on seen classes and struggle with domain shifts for unseen ones. To address this issue, we propose the InPK model, which infuses class-specific prior knowledge into the learnable tokens during initialization, thus enabling the model to explicitly focus on class-relevant information. Furthermore, to mitigate the weakening of class information by multi-layer encoders, we continuously reinforce the interaction between learnable tokens and prior knowledge across multiple feature levels. This progressive interaction allows the learnable tokens to better capture the fine-grained differences and universal visual concepts within prior knowledge, enabling the model to extract more discriminative and generalized text features. Even for unseen classes, the learned interaction allows the model to capture their common representations and infer their appropriate positions within the existing semantic structure. Moreover, we introduce a learnable text-to-vision projection layer to accommodate the text adjustments, ensuring better alignment of visual-text semantics. Extensive experiments on 11 recognition datasets show that InPK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple zero/few-shot image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP field with necessary modifications for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model is designed to efficiently handle sparse inputs and demonstrate robust global processing capabilities, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage lies in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, which renders it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for windowing operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

Due to the binarization of weights and activations, the possible values of each entry in the feature maps generated by BNNs are strongly constrained. To tackle this limitation, we propose the expanding-and-shrinking operation, which enhances binary feature maps with negligible increase of computation complexity, thereby strengthening the representation capacity. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks reveal that our approach generalizes well across diverse applications ranging from image classification, object detection to generative diffusion model, while also achieving remarkable improvement over various leading binarization algorithms based on different architectures including both CNNs and Transformers.</p></details> |  | None |

To enhance feature extraction efficiency while skipping redundant information, this paper proposes a dynamic attention convolution design based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model. The design employs multiple parallel convolutional kernels instead of a single kernel and assigns dynamic attention weights to these parallel convolutions. This dynamic attention mechanism achieves adaptive feature response based on spatial characteristics in the spatial dimension of hyperspectral images, focusing more on key spatial structures. In the spectral dimension, it enables dynamic discrimination of different bands, alleviating information redundancy and computational complexity caused by high spectral dimensionality. The DAC module enhances model representation capability by attention-based aggregation of multiple convolutional kernels without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both inference speed and accuracy, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

We also observe that pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit inter-layer redundancy akin to that in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, dense convolutional layers can be efficiently replaced by derived ``child" layers generated from a shared ``parent" convolutional kernel through an adapter. To address these limitations and implement the weight-sharing mechanism, we propose a lightweight convolution kernel plug-in, named KernelDNA. It decouples kernel adaptation into input-dependent dynamic routing and pre-trained static modulation, ensuring both parameter efficiency and hardware-friendly inference. Unlike existing dynamic convolutions that expand parameters via multi-kernel ensembles, our method leverages cross-layer weight sharing and adapter-based modulation, enabling dynamic kernel specialization without altering the standard convolution structure. This design preserves the native computational efficiency of standard convolutions while enhancing representation power through input-adaptive kernel adjustments. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction tasks demonstrate that KernelDNA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency balance among dynamic convolution variants.

To address this, we leverage the visual-textual alignment within Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable unsupervised learning of a medical image classifier. In this work, we propose \underline{Med}ical \underline{Un}supervised \underline{A}daptation (\texttt{MedUnA}) of VLMs, where the LLM-generated descriptions for each class are encoded into text embeddings and matched with class labels via a cross-modal adapter. This adapter attaches to a visual encoder of \texttt{MedCLIP} and aligns the visual embeddings through unsupervised learning, driven by a contrastive entropy-based loss and prompt tuning. Thereby, improving performance in scenarios where textual information is more abundant than labeled images, particularly in the healthcare domain. Unlike traditional VLMs, \texttt{MedUnA} uses \textbf{unpaired images and text} for learning representations and enhances the potential of VLMs beyond traditional constraints. We evaluate the performance on three chest X-ray datasets and two multi-class datasets (diabetic retinopathy and skin lesions), showing significant accuracy gains over the zero-shot baseline.

| **[Low Saturation Confidence Distribution-based Test-Time Adaptation for Cross-Domain Remote Sensing Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16265v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful technique for addressing the distribution shift across various Remote Sensing (RS) applications. However, most UDA approaches require access to source data, which may be infeasible due to data privacy or transmission constraints. Source-free Domain Adaptation addresses the absence of source data but usually demands a large amount of target domain data beforehand, hindering rapid adaptation and restricting their applicability in broader scenarios. In practical cross-domain RS image classification, achieving a balance between adaptation speed and accuracy is crucial. Therefore, we propose Low Saturation Confidence Distribution Test-Time Adaptation (LSCD-TTA), marketing the first attempt to explore Test-Time Adaptation for cross-domain RS image classification without requiring source or target training data. LSCD-TTA adapts a source-trained model on the fly using only the target test data encountered during inference, enabling immediate and efficient adaptation while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, LSCD-TTA incorporates three optimization strategies tailored to the distribution characteristics of RS images. Firstly, weak-confidence softmax-entropy loss emphasizes categories that are more difficult to classify to address unbalanced class distribution. Secondly, balanced-categories softmax-entropy loss softens and balances the predicted probabilities to tackle the category diversity. Finally, low saturation distribution loss utilizes soft log-likelihood ratios to reduce the impact of low-confidence samples in the later stages of adaptation. By effectively combining these losses, LSCD-TTA enables rapid and accurate adaptation to the target domain for RS image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

This degradation not only impacts overall performance but also disproportionately affects various demographic subgroups, raising critical algorithmic bias concerns. Although robust learning algorithms like Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) have shown promise in improving overall model robustness and generalization, they fall short in addressing the biased performance degradation across demographic subgroups. Existing fairness-aware machine learning methods - such as fairness constraints and reweighing strategies - aim to reduce performance disparities but hardly maintain robust and equitable accuracy across demographic subgroups when faced with data corruption. This reveals an inherent tension between robustness and fairness when dealing with corrupted data. To address these challenges, we introduce one novel metric specifically designed to assess performance degradation across subgroups under data corruption. Additionally, we propose \textbf{FairSAM}, a new framework that integrates \underline{Fair}ness-oriented strategies into \underline{SAM} to deliver equalized performance across demographic groups under corrupted conditions. Our experiments on multiple real-world datasets and various predictive tasks show that FairSAM successfully reconciles robustness and fairness, offering a structured solution for equitable and resilient image classification in the presence of data corruption.</p></details> |  | None |

However, purely SSM-based models face critical challenges related to stability and achieving state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. Our paper addresses the challenges of scaling SSM-based models for computer vision, particularly the instability and inefficiency of large model sizes. We introduce a parameter-efficient modulated group mamba layer that divides the input channels into four groups and applies our proposed SSM-based efficient Visual Single Selective Scanning (VSSS) block independently to each group, with each VSSS block scanning in one of the four spatial directions. The Modulated Group Mamba layer also wraps the four VSSS blocks into a channel modulation operator to improve cross-channel communication. Furthermore, we introduce a distillation-based training objective to stabilize the training of large models, leading to consistent performance gains. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed contributions, leading to superior performance over existing methods for image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection, instance segmentation on MS-COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our tiny variant with 23M parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance with a classification top-1 accuracy of 83.3% on ImageNet-1K, while being 26% efficient in terms of parameters, compared to the best existing Mamba design of same model size.

Prior approaches have employed only nearest-neighbor based strategies for data selection, which retrieve auxiliary samples with high similarity to instances in the target task. However, these approaches are prone to selecting highly redundant samples, since they fail to incorporate any notion of diversity. In our work, we first demonstrate that data selection strategies used in prior retrieval-augmented few-shot adaptation settings can be generalized using a class of functions known as Combinatorial Mutual Information (CMI) measures. We then propose COBRA (COmBinatorial Retrieval Augmentation), which employs an alternative CMI measure that considers both diversity and similarity to a target dataset. COBRA consistently outperforms previous retrieval approaches across image classification tasks and few-shot learning techniques when used to retrieve samples from LAION-2B. COBRA introduces negligible computational overhead to the cost of retrieval while providing significant gains in downstream model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

The sheer parameter count of these models makes it difficult to fit them into the memory constraints of different hardware. In this work, we present a novel approach to model compression by merging similar parameter groups within a model, rather than pruning away less important parameters. Specifically, we select, align, and merge separate feed-forward sublayers in Transformer models, and test our method on language modeling, image classification, and machine translation. With our method, we demonstrate performance comparable to the original models while combining more than a third of model feed-forward sublayers, and demonstrate improved performance over a strong layer-pruning baseline. For instance, we can remove over 21% of total parameters from a Vision Transformer, while maintaining 99% of its original performance. Additionally, we observe that some groups of feed-forward sublayers exhibit high activation similarity, which may help explain their surprising mergeability.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior work in this direction masks out pre-defined frequencies in the input image and employs a reconstruction loss to pre-train the model. While achieving promising results, such an implementation has two fundamental limitations as identified in our paper. First, using pre-defined frequencies overlooks the variability of image frequency responses. Second, pre-trained with frequency-filtered images, the resulting model needs relatively more data to adapt to naturally looking images during fine-tuning. To address these drawbacks, we propose FOurier transform compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), integrating two dedicated ideas. First, inspired by image compression, we adaptively select the masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses, creating more suitable SSL tasks for pre-training. Second, we employ a two-branch framework empowered by knowledge distillation, enabling the model to take both the filtered and original images as input, largely reducing the burden of downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLK in achieving competitive performance to many state-of-the-art SSL methods across various downstream tasks, including image classification, few-shot learning, and semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Utilizing the datasets PAD-UFES-20 for skin cancer and P-NDB-UFES for oral cancer, the diffusion model demonstrated competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Specifically, for the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, the model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.6457 for six-class classification and 0.8357 for binary classification (cancer vs. non-cancer). For the P-NDB-UFES dataset, it attained a balanced accuracy of 0.9050. These results suggest that diffusion models are viable models for classifying medical images of skin and oral lesions.

In a broad understanding, it provides adaptive control over the information flow while maintaining computational efficiency. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis on how the gating mechanism works in neural networks. In this paper, inspired by the {convolution theorem}, we systematically explore the effect of gating mechanisms on the training dynamics of neural networks from a frequency perspective. We investigate the interact between the element-wise product and activation functions in managing the responses to different frequency components. Leveraging these insights, we propose a Gating Mechanism Network (GmNet), a lightweight model designed to efficiently utilize the information of various frequency components. It minimizes the low-frequency bias present in existing lightweight models. GmNet achieves impressive performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency in the image classification task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data-Free Universal Attack by Exploiting the Intrinsic Vulnerability of Deep Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22205v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which are instance agnostic perturbations that can deceive a target model across a wide range of samples. Unlike instance-specific adversarial examples, UAPs present a greater challenge as they must generalize across different samples and models. Generating UAPs typically requires access to numerous examples, which is a strong assumption in real-world tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-free method called Intrinsic UAP (IntriUAP), by exploiting the intrinsic vulnerabilities of deep models. We analyze a series of popular deep models composed of linear and nonlinear layers with a Lipschitz constant of 1, revealing that the vulnerability of these models is predominantly influenced by their linear components. Based on this observation, we leverage the ill-conditioned nature of the linear components by aligning the UAP with the right singular vectors corresponding to the maximum singular value of each linear layer. Remarkably, our method achieves highly competitive performance in attacking popular image classification deep models without using any image samples. We also evaluate the black-box attack performance of our method, showing that it matches the state-of-the-art baseline for data-free methods on models that conform to our theoretical framework. Beyond the data-free assumption, IntriUAP also operates under a weaker assumption, where the adversary only can access a few of the victim model's layers. Experiments demonstrate that the attack success rate decreases by only 4% when the adversary has access to just 50% of the linear layers in the victim model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing D-FL methods use gossip protocols, which are inefficient when not all nodes in the network are D-FL clients. This paper puts forth a new D-FL strategy, termed Route-and-Aggregate (R&A) D-FL, where participating clients exchange models with their peers through established routes (as opposed to flooding) and adaptively normalize their aggregation coefficients to compensate for communication errors. The impact of routing and imperfect links on the convergence of R&A D-FL is analyzed, revealing that convergence is minimized when routes with the minimum end-to-end packet error rates are employed to deliver models. Our analysis is experimentally validated through three image classification tasks and two next-word prediction tasks, utilizing widely recognized datasets and models. R&A D-FL outperforms the flooding-based D-FL method in terms of training accuracy by 35% in our tested 10-client network, and shows strong synergy between D-FL and networking. In another test with 10 D-FL clients, the training accuracy of R&A D-FL with communication errors approaches that of the ideal C-FL without communication errors, as the number of routing nodes (i.e., nodes that do not participate in the training of D-FL) rises to 28.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, applying NAS to a new computer vision task still requires a huge amount of effort. This is because 1) previous NAS research has been over-prioritized on image classification while largely ignoring other tasks; 2) many NAS works focus on optimizing task-specific components that cannot be favorably transferred to other tasks; and 3) existing NAS methods are typically designed to be "proxyless" and require significant effort to be integrated with each new task's training pipelines. To tackle these challenges, we propose FBNetV5, a NAS framework that can search for neural architectures for a variety of vision tasks with much reduced computational cost and human effort. Specifically, we design 1) a search space that is simple yet inclusive and transferable; 2) a multitask search process that is disentangled with target tasks' training pipeline; and 3) an algorithm to simultaneously search for architectures for multiple tasks with a computational cost agnostic to the number of tasks. We evaluate the proposed FBNetV5 targeting three fundamental vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Models searched by FBNetV5 in a single run of search have outperformed the previous stateof-the-art in all the three tasks: image classification (e.g., +1.3% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the same FLOPs as compared to FBNetV3), semantic segmentation (e.g., +1.8% higher ADE20K val. mIoU than SegFormer with 3.6x fewer FLOPs), and object detection (e.g., +1.1% COCO val. mAP with 1.2x fewer FLOPs as compared to YOLOX).</p></details> |  | None |

Despite this remarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance are surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a predefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, code is available at https://github.com/altndrr/lmms-owc</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/altndrr/lmms-owc) |

However, they struggle with global context modeling due to their data-independent matrices. The Mamba model addressed this with data-dependent variants via the S6 selective-scan algorithm, enhancing context modeling, especially for long sequences. However, Mamba-based architectures are difficult to scale with respect to the number of parameters, which is a major limitation for vision applications. This paper addresses the scalability issue of large SSMs for image classification and action recognition without requiring additional techniques like knowledge distillation. We analyze the distinct characteristics of Mamba-based and Attention-based models, proposing a Mamba-Attention interleaved architecture that enhances scalability, robustness, and performance. We demonstrate that the stable and efficient interleaved architecture resolves the scalability issue of Mamba-based architectures for images and videos and increases robustness to common artifacts like JPEG compression. Our thorough evaluation on the ImageNet-1K, Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2 benchmarks demonstrates that our approach improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art Mamba-based architectures by up to $+1.7$.</p></details> |  | None |

Our primary objective is to bridge this healthcare gap by developing a comprehensive diagnostic system capable of accurately predicting retinal diseases solely from fundus images. However, we faced significant challenges due to limited, diverse datasets and imbalanced class distributions. To overcome these issues, we have devised innovative strategies.

Our overarching goal is to assess these advanced models' potential in practical applications, with a strong focus on enhancing retinal disease diagnosis accuracy across a broader spectrum of conditions. Importantly, our efforts have surpassed baseline model results, with the C-Tran ensemble model emerging as the leader, achieving a remarkable model score of 0.9166, surpassing the baseline score of 0.9. Additionally, experiments with the IEViT model showcased equally promising outcomes with improved computational efficiency. We've also demonstrated the effectiveness of dynamic patch extraction and the integration of domain knowledge in computer vision tasks.

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Federated Learning (FL) is posed as potential solution to data privacy challenges in distributed machine learning by enabling collaborative model training {without data sharing}. However, FL systems remain vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, where malicious nodes contribute corrupted model updates. While Byzantine Resilient operators have emerged as a widely adopted robust aggregation algorithm to mitigate these attacks, its efficacy diminishes significantly in high-dimensional parameter spaces, sometimes leading to poor performing models.

| **[Neural Architecture Search by Learning a Hierarchical Search Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21061v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a powerful tool for many non-differentiable search related problems such as adversarial games. However, the performance of such approach highly depends on the order of the nodes that are considered at each branching of the tree. If the first branches cannot distinguish between promising and deceiving configurations for the final task, the efficiency of the search is exponentially reduced. In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), as only the final architecture matters, the visiting order of the branching can be optimized to improve learning. In this paper, we study the application of MCTS to NAS for image classification. We analyze several sampling methods and branching alternatives for MCTS and propose to learn the branching by hierarchical clustering of architectures based on their similarity. The similarity is measured by the pairwise distance of output vectors of architectures. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that MCTS, if provided with a good branching hierarchy, can yield promising solutions more efficiently than other approaches for NAS problems.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, privacy risks in FL persist, as servers can potentially reconstruct clients' training data through gradient inversion attacks (GIA). Although GIA is demonstrated for image classification tasks, little is known about time series regression tasks. In this paper, we first conduct an extensive empirical study on inverting TS data across 4 TSF models and 4 datasets, identifying the unique challenges of reconstructing both observations and targets of TS data. We then propose TS-Inverse, a novel GIA that improves the inversion of TS data by (i) learning a gradient inversion model that outputs quantile predictions, (ii) a unique loss function that incorporates periodicity and trend regularization, and (iii) regularization according to the quantile predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate a remarkable performance of TS-Inverse, achieving at least a 2x-10x improvement in terms of the sMAPE metric over existing GIA methods on TS data.

However, transformer architectures typically involve multiple types of computational layers, including linear layers for MLP modules and classification heads, convolution layers for tokenizers, and dot product computations for self-attention mechanisms. These diverse operations pose significant challenges for hardware accelerator design, and to our knowledge, there is not yet a hardware solution that leverages spike-form data from SNNs for transformer architectures. In this paper, we introduce VESTA, a novel hardware design that synergizes these technologies, presenting unified Processing Elements (PEs) capable of efficiently performing all three types of computations crucial to transformer structures. VESTA uniquely benefits from the spike-form outputs of the Spike Neuron Layers \cite{zhou2024spikformer}, simplifying multiplication operations by reducing them from handling two 8-bit integers to handling one 8-bit integer and a binary spike. This reduction enables the use of multiplexers in the PE module, significantly enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining the low-power advantage of SNNs. Experimental results show that the core area of VESTA is \(0.844 mm^2\). It operates at 500MHz and is capable of real-time image classification at 30 fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in 2024 Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (APCCAS 2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[Explaining Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification by Evolving Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15143v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep convolutional neural networks have proven their effectiveness, and have been acknowledged as the most dominant method for image classification. However, a severe drawback of deep convolutional neural networks is poor explainability. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, users need to understand the rationale behind the predictions of deep convolutional neural networks when determining whether they should trust the predictions or not. To resolve this issue, a novel genetic algorithm-based method is proposed for the first time to automatically evolve local explanations that can assist users to assess the rationality of the predictions. Furthermore, the proposed method is model-agnostic, i.e., it can be utilised to explain any deep convolutional neural network models. In the experiments, ResNet is used as an example model to be explained, and the ImageNet dataset is selected as the benchmark dataset. DenseNet and MobileNet are further explained to demonstrate the model-agnostic characteristic of the proposed method. The evolved local explanations on four images, randomly selected from ImageNet, are presented, which show that the evolved local explanations are straightforward to be recognised by humans. Moreover, the evolved explanations can explain the predictions of deep convolutional neural networks on all four images very well by successfully capturing meaningful interpretable features of the sample images. Further analysis based on the 30 runs of the experiments exhibits that the evolved local explanations can also improve the probabilities/confidences of the deep convolutional neural network models in making the predictions. The proposed method can obtain local explanations within one minute, which is more than ten times faster than LIME (the state-of-the-art method).</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, we incorporate the entropy regularizer into this framework, leading to a novel sample selection objective and a provable sample complexity bound that guarantees a $(1+\epsilon)$-near optimal solution. We further extend the method to handle regularized optimal design settings. As an application, we use our algorithm to select a small set of representative samples from image classification datasets without relying on label information. To evaluate the quality of the selected samples, we train a logistic regression model and compare performance against several baseline sampling strategies. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a 50-class subset of ImageNet show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods in most cases.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIP-EBC: CLIP Can Count Accurately through Enhanced Blockwise Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09281v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose CLIP-EBC, the first fully CLIP-based model for accurate crowd density estimation. While the CLIP model has demonstrated remarkable success in addressing recognition tasks such as zero-shot image classification, its potential for counting has been largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges in transforming a regression problem, such as counting, into a recognition task. In this work, we investigate and enhance CLIP's ability to count, focusing specifically on the task of estimating crowd sizes from images. Existing classification-based crowd-counting frameworks have significant limitations, including the quantization of count values into bordering real-valued bins and the sole focus on classification errors. These practices result in label ambiguity near the shared borders and inaccurate prediction of count values. Hence, directly applying CLIP within these frameworks may yield suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we first propose the Enhanced Blockwise Classification (EBC) framework. Unlike previous methods, EBC utilizes integer-valued bins, effectively reducing ambiguity near bin boundaries. Additionally, it incorporates a regression loss based on density maps to improve the prediction of count values. Within our backbone-agnostic EBC framework, we then introduce CLIP-EBC to fully leverage CLIP's recognition capabilities for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EBC and the competitive performance of CLIP-EBC. Specifically, our EBC framework can improve existing classification-based methods by up to 44.5% on the UCF-QNRF dataset, and CLIP-EBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NWPU-Crowd test set, with an MAE of 58.2 and an RMSE of 268.5, representing improvements of 8.6% and 13.3% over the previous best method, STEERER.

Current approaches often employ a two-stage transfer learning process: first, adapting a backbone model trained on natural images to develop a patch classifier, which is then used to create a single-view whole-image classifier. Additionally, many studies leverage both mammographic views to enhance model performance. In this work, we systematically investigate five key questions: (1) Is the intermediate patch classifier essential for optimal performance? (2) Do backbone models that excel in natural image classification consistently outperform others on mammograms? (3) When reducing mammogram resolution for GPU processing, does the learn-to-resize technique outperform conventional methods? (4) Does incorporating both mammographic views in a two-view classifier significantly improve detection accuracy? (5) How do these findings vary when analyzing low-quality versus high-quality mammograms? By addressing these questions, we developed models that outperform previous results for both single-view and two-view classifiers. Our findings provide insights into model architecture and transfer learning strategies contributing to more accurate and efficient mammogram analysis.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

While recent methods have attempted to address this limitation, they typically lack sufficient parameter and memory efficiency. We propose VectorFit, an effective and easily deployable approach that adaptively trains the singular vectors and biases of pre-trained weight matrices. We demonstrate that the utilization of structural and transformational characteristics of pre-trained weights enables high-rank updates comparable to those of full fine-tuning. As a result, VectorFit achieves superior performance with 9X less trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Through extensive experiments over 17 datasets spanning diverse language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we exhibit that VectorFit consistently outperforms baselines, even in extremely low-budget scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, diagnostic models often face the challenge of forgetting previously learned data during incremental training on datasets from different sources. To address this issue, we propose a new framework PaGMIL to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in breast cancer WSI classification. Our framework introduces two key components into the common MIL model architecture. First, it leverages microscopic pathological prior to select more accurate and diverse representative patches for MIL. Secondly, it trains separate classification heads for each task and uses macroscopic pathological prior knowledge, treating the thumbnail as a prompt guide (PG) to select the appropriate classification head. We evaluate the continual learning performance of PaGMIL across several public breast cancer datasets. PaGMIL achieves a better balance between the performance of the current task and the retention of previous tasks, outperforming other continual learning methods. Our code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | ICASSP2025(Oral) | None |

However, existing distributed remote sensing models often rely on centralized training, resulting in data leakage, communication overhead, and reduced accuracy due to data distribution discrepancies across platforms. To address these challenges, we propose the \textit{Self-Adjustment FEderated Learning} (SAFE) framework, which innovatively leverages federated learning to enhance collaborative sensing in remote sensing scenarios. SAFE introduces four key strategies: (1) \textit{Class Rectification Optimization}, which autonomously addresses class imbalance under unknown local and global distributions. (2) \textit{Feature Alignment Update}, which mitigates Non-IID data issues via locally controlled EMA updates. (3) \textit{Dual-Factor Modulation Rheostat}, which dynamically balances optimization effects during training. (4) \textit{Adaptive Context Enhancement}, which is designed to improve model performance by dynamically refining foreground regions, ensuring computational efficiency with accuracy improvement across distributed satellites. Experiments on real-world image classification and object segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness and reliability of the SAFE framework in complex remote sensing scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CKD: Contrastive Knowledge Distillation from A Sample-wise Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14109v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective contrastive knowledge distillation framework that achieves sample-wise logit alignment while preserving semantic consistency. Conventional knowledge distillation approaches exhibit over-reliance on feature similarity per sample, which risks overfitting, and contrastive approaches focus on inter-class discrimination at the expense of intra-sample semantic relationships. Our approach transfers "dark knowledge" through teacher-student contrastive alignment at the sample level. Specifically, our method first enforces intra-sample alignment by directly minimizing teacher-student logit discrepancies within individual samples. Then, we utilize inter-sample contrasts to preserve semantic dissimilarities across samples. By redefining positive pairs as aligned teacher-student logits from identical samples and negative pairs as cross-sample logit combinations, we reformulate these dual constraints into an InfoNCE loss framework, reducing computational complexity lower than sample squares while eliminating dependencies on temperature parameters and large batch sizes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across three benchmark datasets, including the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS COCO datasets, and experimental results clearly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LRSCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Aligning Remote Sensing Image with Longer Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19311v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the technical bottlenecks in handling long text and the "hallucination" issue caused by insufficient short text information in remote sensing vision-language foundation models (VLFM). We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning.

This study evaluates the performance of three vision based models, MobileNetV2, ResNET50, and Vision Transformer, ViT, for spoof detection in image classification, utilizing a dataset of 150,986 images divided into training , 140,002, testing, 10,984, and validation ,39,574, sets. Spoof detection is critical for enhancing the security of image recognition systems, and this research compares the models effectiveness through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Results reveal that MobileNetV2 outperforms other architectures on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy of 91.59%, precision of 91.72%, recall of 91.59%, and F1 score of 91.58%, compared to ViT 86.54%, 88.28%, 86.54%, and 86.39%, respectively. On the validation dataset, MobileNetV2, and ViT excel, with MobileNetV2 slightly ahead at 97.17% accuracy versus ViT 96.36%. MobileNetV2 demonstrates faster convergence during training and superior generalization to unseen data, despite both models showing signs of overfitting. These findings highlight MobileNetV2 balanced performance and robustness, making it the preferred choice for spoof detection applications where reliability on new data is essential. The study underscores the importance of model selection in security sensitive contexts and suggests MobileNetV2 as a practical solution for real world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures,3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Gradient-Guided Annealing for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20162v4)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) research has gained considerable traction as of late, since the ability to generalize to unseen data distributions is a requirement that eludes even state-of-the-art training algorithms. In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in CVPR2025</p></details> | None |

While achieving excellent results in image classification and segmentation, Transformers remain inherently reliant on large training datasets and remain computationally expensive. A newly introduced Transformer derivative named KV Transformer shows promising results in synthetic, NLP, and image classification tasks, while reducing complexity and memory usage. This is especially conducive to use cases where local inference is required, such as medical screening applications. We endeavoured to further evaluate the merit of KV Transformers on semantic segmentation tasks, specifically in the domain of medical imaging. By directly comparing traditional and KV variants of the same base architectures, we provide further insight into the practical tradeoffs of reduced model complexity. We observe a notable reduction in parameter count and multiply accumulate operations, while achieving similar performance from most of the KV variant models when directly compared to their QKV implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Preprint.

Mutation testing evaluates test dataset quality based on their ability to uncover injected faults in DNNs as measured by mutation score (MS). At the same time, its high computational cost motivates researchers to seek alternative test adequacy criteria. We propose Latent Space Class Dispersion (LSCD), a novel metric to quantify the quality of test datasets for DNNs. It measures the degree of dispersion within a test dataset as observed in the latent space of a DNN. Our empirical study shows that LSCD reveals and quantifies deficiencies in the test dataset of three popular benchmarks pertaining to image classification tasks using DNNs. Corner cases generated using automated fuzzing were found to help enhance fault detection and improve the overall quality of the original test sets calculated by MS and LSCD. Our experiments revealed a high positive correlation (0.87) between LSCD and MS, significantly higher than the one achieved by the well-studied Distance-based Surprise Coverage (0.25). These results were obtained from 129 mutants generated through pre-training mutation operators, with statistical significance and a high validity of corner cases. These observations suggest that LSCD can serve as a cost-effective alternative to expensive mutation testing, eliminating the need to generate mutant models while offering comparably valuable insights into test dataset quality for DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, domain-specific concepts often impact the final predictions, which subsequently undermine the model generalization capabilities, and prevent the model from being used in high-stake applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Language-guided Concept-Erasing (LanCE) framework. In particular, we empirically demonstrate that pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) can approximate distinct visual domain shifts via domain descriptors while prompting large Language Models (LLMs) can easily simulate a wide range of descriptors of unseen visual domains. Then, we introduce a novel plug-in domain descriptor orthogonality (DDO) regularizer to mitigate the impact of these domain-specific concepts on the final predictions. Notably, the DDO regularizer is agnostic to the design of concept-based models and we integrate it into several prevailing models. Through evaluation of domain generalization on four standard benchmarks and three newly introduced benchmarks, we demonstrate that DDO can significantly improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over the previous state-of-the-art concept-based models.Our code is available at https://github.com/joeyz0z/LanCE.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/joeyz0z/LanCE) |

However, their broader applicability is hindered by two major challenges. First, existing methods mainly rely on a known template during testing, which is impractical and limits flexibility. Second, they often struggle to capture fine-grained, voxel-level distinctions between similar shapes (e.g., anatomical variations among healthy individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment, and diseased states). To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework - Contrastive Representation Learning of Deformable shapes (CoRLD) in learned deformation spaces and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of image classification. Our CoRLD leverages a class-aware contrastive supervised learning objective in latent deformation spaces, promoting proximity among representations of similar classes while ensuring separation of dissimilar groups. In contrast to previous deep learning networks that require a reference image as input to predict deformation changes, our approach eliminates this dependency. Instead, template images are utilized solely as ground truth in the loss function during the training process, making our model more flexible and generalizable to a wide range of medical applications. We validate CoRLD on diverse datasets, including real brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) and adrenal shapes derived from computed tomography (CT) scans. Experimental results show that our model effectively extracts deformable shape features, which can be easily integrated with existing classifiers to substantially boost the classification accuracy.

To enable theoretical analysis, recent work has examined whether a network learns task-relevant features (rich learning) or resembles a random feature model (or a kernel machine, i.e., lazy learning). However, this simple lazy-versus-rich dichotomy overlooks the possibility of various subtypes of feature learning that emerge from different architectures, learning rules, and data properties. Furthermore, most existing approaches emphasize weight matrices or neural tangent kernels, limiting their applicability to neuroscience because they do not explicitly characterize representations. In this work, we introduce an analysis framework based on representational geometry to study feature learning. Instead of analyzing what are the learned features, we focus on characterizing how task-relevant representational manifolds evolve during the learning process. In both theory and experiment, we find that when a network learns features useful for solving a task, the task-relevant manifolds become increasingly untangled. Moreover, by tracking changes in the underlying manifold geometry, we uncover distinct learning stages throughout training, as well as different learning strategies associated with training hyperparameters, uncovering subtypes of feature learning beyond the lazy-versus-rich dichotomy. Applying our method to neuroscience and machine learning, we gain geometric insights into the structural inductive biases of neural circuits solving cognitive tasks and the mechanisms underlying out-of-distribution generalization in image classification. Our framework provides a novel geometric perspective for understanding and quantifying feature learning in both artificial and biological neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Among these, generative self-supervised vision learning approaches such as MAE and BEiT show promising performance. However, their global masked reconstruction mechanism is computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose local masked reconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked reconstruction within a small window of 7$\times$7 patches on a simple Transformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy compared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained LoMaR on 384$\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing MAE by 0.6%. On MS COCO, LoMaR outperforms MAE by 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{box}$ on object detection and 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{mask}$ on instance segmentation. LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction learning mechanism can be easily integrated into any other generative self-supervised learning approach.

However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30\% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18242v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank adaptation, also known as LoRA, has emerged as a prominent method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. Despite its computational efficiency, LoRA still yields inferior performance compared to full fine-tuning. In this paper, we first uncover a fundamental connection between the optimization processes of LoRA and full fine-tuning: using LoRA for optimization is mathematically equivalent to full fine-tuning using a low-rank gradient for parameter updates. And this low-rank gradient can be expressed in terms of the gradients of the two low-rank matrices in LoRA. Leveraging this insight, we introduce LoRA-Pro, a method that enhances LoRA's performance by strategically adjusting the gradients of these low-rank matrices. This adjustment allows the low-rank gradient to more accurately approximate the full fine-tuning gradient, thereby narrowing the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the optimal solutions for adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices, applying them during fine-tuning in LoRA-Pro. We conduct extensive experiments across natural language understanding, dialogue generation, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and image classification tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-Pro substantially improves LoRA's performance, effectively narrowing the gap with full fine-tuning.

| **[Leveraging Text-to-Image Generation for Handling Spurious Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17226v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) perform well when both training and test data come from the same domain, but they often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a technique to generate training samples with text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples for in which this correlation does not exist. Our experiments show that across different benchmarks, our technique achieves better worst-group accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Embedded Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01003v5)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale data have been widely witnessed to achieve success in various natural imaging downstream tasks. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to adapt foundation models to new domains by updating only a small portion of parameters in order to reduce computational overhead. However, the effectiveness of these PEFT methods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image analysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of the performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate the limitations of prompt introducing ways and approximation capabilities on Transformer architectures of mainstream prompt tuning methods, we propose the Embedded Prompt Tuning (EPT) method by embedding prompt tokens into the expanded channels. We also find that there are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models during pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative impact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to understand prompt tuning: Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator. And we support it by analyzing patch-wise scaling and feature separation operations contained in EPT. Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot medical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process within highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method.

Yet, it is an open question which mechanisms take place during adaptation. Here we develop a new Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) for the CLIP vision transformer, named PatchSAE, to extract interpretable concepts at granular levels (e.g., shape, color, or semantics of an object) and their patch-wise spatial attributions. We explore how these concepts influence the model output in downstream image classification tasks and investigate how recent state-of-the-art prompt-based adaptation techniques change the association of model inputs to these concepts. While activations of concepts slightly change between adapted and non-adapted models, we find that the majority of gains on common adaptation tasks can be explained with the existing concepts already present in the non-adapted foundation model. This work provides a concrete framework to train and use SAEs for Vision Transformers and provides insights into explaining adaptation mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, they often fall short in other critical quality dimensions, such as robustness, calibration, or fairness. While existing studies have focused on a subset of these quality dimensions, none have explored a more general form of "well-behavedness" of DNNs. With this work, we address this gap by simultaneously studying nine different quality dimensions for image classification. Through a large-scale study, we provide a bird's-eye view by analyzing 326 backbone models and how different training paradigms and model architectures affect the quality dimensions. We reveal various new insights such that (i) vision-language models exhibit high fairness on ImageNet-1k classification and strong robustness against domain changes; (ii) self-supervised learning is an effective training paradigm to improve almost all considered quality dimensions; and (iii) the training dataset size is a major driver for most of the quality dimensions. We conclude our study by introducing the QUBA score (Quality Understanding Beyond Accuracy), a novel metric that ranks models across multiple dimensions of quality, enabling tailored recommendations based on specific user needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/visinf/beyond-accuracy</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/visinf/beyond-accuracy) |

However, machine vision achieved by DNNs cannot be as robust as human perception. Adversarial attacks and data distribution shifts have been known as two major scenarios which degrade machine performance and obstacle the wide deployment of machines "in the wild". In order to break these obstructions and facilitate the research of model robustness, we develop EasyRobust, a comprehensive and easy-to-use toolkit for training, evaluation and analysis of robust vision models. EasyRobust targets at two types of robustness: 1) Adversarial robustness enables the model to defense against malicious inputs crafted by worst-case perturbations, also known as adversarial examples; 2) Non-adversarial robustness enhances the model performance on natural test images with corruptions or distribution shifts. Thorough benchmarks on image classification enable EasyRobust to provide an accurate robustness evaluation on vision models. We wish our EasyRobust can help for training practically-robust models and promote academic and industrial progress in closing the gap between human and machine vision.

Inspired by this, we propose JPEG-DL, a novel DL framework that prepends any underlying DNN architecture with a trainable JPEG compression layer. To make the quantization operation in JPEG compression trainable, a new differentiable soft quantizer is employed at the JPEG layer, and then the quantization operation and underlying DNN are jointly trained. Extensive experiments show that in comparison with the standard DL, JPEG-DL delivers significant accuracy improvements across various datasets and model architectures while enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks. Particularly, on some fine-grained image classification datasets, JPEG-DL can increase prediction accuracy by as much as 20.9%.

AI-driven automated classification has emerged as a promising solution, with deep learning models demonstrating impressive performance in plant disease identification. However, deploying these models on mobile and edge devices remains challenging due to high computational demands and resource constraints, highlighting the need for lightweight, accurate solutions for accessible smart agriculture systems. To address this, we propose MobilePlantViT, a novel hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture designed for generalized plant disease classification, which optimizes resource efficiency while maintaining high performance.

WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis.

Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data. We expand on this line of research by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. We also present a theoretical analysis on how the accuracy estimator variance depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. Finally, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms training on real data mined from the dataset used in the original diffusion model training.

Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated with Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by 6.77% on average and retrieval performance by 4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model.

Recent research has shown that although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are initially poor at image classification, fine-tuning them with an adequate amount of data can significantly enhance their performance, making them comparable to SOTA classification models. However, acquiring large-scale labeled data is expensive. In this paper, we explore few-shot MLLM classification fine-tuning. We found that SFT can cause severe overfitting issues and may even degrade performance over the zero-shot approach. To address this challenge, inspired by the recent successes in rule-based reinforcement learning, we propose CLS-RL, which uses verifiable signals as reward to fine-tune MLLMs. We discovered that CLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has a much higher average accuracy on both base-to-new and few-shot learning setting. Moreover, we observed a free-lunch phenomenon for CLS-RL; when models are fine-tuned on a particular dataset, their performance on other distinct datasets may also improve over zero-shot models, even if those datasets differ in distribution and class names. This suggests that RL-based methods effectively teach models the fundamentals of classification. Lastly, inspired by recent works in inference time thinking, we re-examine the `thinking process' during fine-tuning, a critical aspect of RL-based methods, in the context of visual classification. We question whether such tasks require extensive thinking process during fine-tuning, proposing that this may actually detract from performance. Based on this premise, we introduce the No-Thinking-CLS-RL method, which minimizes thinking processes during training by setting an equality accuracy reward. Our findings indicate that, with much less fine-tuning time, No-Thinking-CLS-RL method achieves superior in-domain performance and generalization capabilities than CLS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-weighted contrastive learning approach that avoids the use of superpixel partitioning and directly employs neural networks to learn hyperspectral image representation. Furthermore, while many approaches require all graph nodes to be available during training, our approach supports mini-batch training by processing only a subset of nodes at a time, reducing computational complexity and improving generalization to unseen nodes. Experimental results on three widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to baselines relying on superpixel partitioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Electronic Imaging, 2025</p></details> | None |

To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality.

In this work, we present the first comprehensive QML study by benchmarking the MedMNIST-a diverse collection of medical imaging datasets on a 127-qubit real IBM quantum hardware, to evaluate the feasibility and performance of quantum models (without any classical neural networks) in practical applications. This study explores recent advancements in quantum computing such as device-aware quantum circuits, error suppression, and mitigation for medical image classification. Our methodology is comprised of three stages: preprocessing, generation of noise-resilient and hardware-efficient quantum circuits, optimizing/training of quantum circuits on classical hardware, and inference on real IBM quantum hardware. Firstly, we process all input images in the preprocessing stage to reduce the spatial dimension due to quantum hardware limitations. We generate hardware-efficient quantum circuits using backend properties expressible to learn complex patterns for medical image classification. After classical optimization of QML models, we perform inference on real quantum hardware. We also incorporate advanced error suppression and mitigation techniques in our QML workflow, including dynamical decoupling (DD), gate twirling, and matrix-free measurement mitigation (M3) to mitigate the effects of noise and improve classification performance.

Detecting poisoned samples (i.e., those containing triggers) at test time can prevent backdoor activation. However, unlike image classification tasks, the unique characteristics of object detection -- particularly its output of numerous objects -- pose fresh challenges for backdoor detection. The complex attack effects (e.g., "ghost" object emergence or "vanishing" object) further render current defenses fundamentally inadequate. To this end, we design TRAnsformation Consistency Evaluation (TRACE), a brand-new method for detecting poisoned samples at test time in object detection. Our journey begins with two intriguing observations: (1) poisoned samples exhibit significantly more consistent detection results than clean ones across varied backgrounds. (2) clean samples show higher detection consistency when introduced to different focal information. Based on these phenomena, TRACE applies foreground and background transformations to each test sample, then assesses transformation consistency by calculating the variance in objects confidences. TRACE achieves black-box, universal backdoor detection, with extensive experiments showing a 30% improvement in AUROC over state-of-the-art defenses and resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Conventional deep learning models tend to produce overconfident predictions despite underlying uncertainties, potentially leading to misdiagnoses. Attention mechanisms have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of the input data. Combined with feature fusion, they can be effective in addressing uncertainty challenges. Cross-attention has become increasingly important in medical image analysis for capturing dependencies across features and modalities. This paper proposes a novel dual cross-attention fusion model for medical image analysis by addressing key challenges in feature integration and interpretability. Our approach introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism with refined channel and spatial attention that dynamically fuses feature maps from EfficientNetB4 and ResNet34 leveraging multi-network contextual dependencies. The refined features through channel and spatial attention highlights discriminative patterns crucial for accurate classification. The proposed model achieved AUC of 99.75%, 100%, 99.93% and 98.69% and AUPR of 99.81%, 100%, 99.97%, and 96.36% on Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia Chest X-ray images and Retinal OCT images respectively. The entropy values and several high uncertain samples give an interpretable visualization from the model enhancing transparency.

However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. Our experiments show that MAT can effectively be applied to different VL models and tasks to improve adversarial robustness, outperforming previous efforts. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.</p></details> | Under review | None |

This paper addresses this issue by proposing a post-hoc natural language explanation method that can be applied to any CNN-based classifier without altering its training process or affecting predictive performance. By analysing influential neurons and the corresponding activation maps, the method generates a faithful description of the classifier's decision process in the form of a structured meaning representation, which is then converted into text by a language model. Through this pipeline approach, the generated explanations are grounded in the neural network architecture, providing accurate insight into the classification process while remaining accessible to non-experts. Experimental results show that the NLEs constructed by our method are significantly more plausible and faithful. In particular, user interventions in the neural network structure (masking of neurons) are three times more effective than the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Stochastic Gradient Sampling for Enhancing Neural Networks Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17042v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce StochGradAdam, a novel optimizer designed as an extension of the Adam algorithm, incorporating stochastic gradient sampling techniques to improve computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance. StochGradAdam optimizes by selectively sampling a subset of gradients during training, reducing the computational cost while preserving the advantages of adaptive learning rates and bias corrections found in Adam. Our experimental results, applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that StochGradAdam can achieve comparable or superior performance to Adam, even when using fewer gradient updates per iteration. By focusing on key gradient updates, StochGradAdam offers stable convergence and enhanced exploration of the loss landscape, while mitigating the impact of noisy gradients. The results suggest that this approach is particularly effective for large-scale models and datasets, providing a promising alternative to traditional optimization techniques for deep learning applications.</p></details> |  | None |

While there is a growing reliance on pre-trained models for classification tasks, these models often require extensive computational resources and may not perform optimally when transferred to new domains due to dataset variations.

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of statistical and structural texture features, demonstrating that their combination achieves competitive performance with large pre-trained models. The proposed NEHD-based approach offers a lightweight and efficient solution for underwater target recognition, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures.

Recent advances in classifiers with 3D volumetric object representations have demonstrated a greatly enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution data. However, these 3D-aware classifiers have not been studied from the perspective of interpretability. We introduce CAVE - Concept Aware Volumes for Explanations - a new direction that unifies interpretability and robustness in image classification. We design an inherently-interpretable and robust classifier by extending existing 3D-aware classifiers with concepts extracted from their volumetric representations for classification. In an array of quantitative metrics for interpretability, we compare against different concept-based approaches across the explainable AI literature and show that CAVE discovers well-grounded concepts that are used consistently across images, while achieving superior robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed mentor-student relationships, our framework dynamically selects and adapts the teaching strategies of diverse mentors based on their effectiveness for each data sample. ClassroomKD comprises two main modules: the Knowledge Filtering (KF) module and the Mentoring module. The KF Module dynamically ranks mentors based on their performance for each input, activating only high-quality mentors to minimize error accumulation and prevent information loss. The Mentoring Module adjusts the distillation strategy by tuning each mentor's influence according to the dynamic performance gap between the student and mentors, effectively modulating the learning pace. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and 2D human pose estimation (COCO Keypoints and MPII Human Pose) demonstrate that ClassroomKD outperforms existing knowledge distillation methods for different network architectures. Our results highlight that a dynamic and adaptive approach to mentor selection and guidance leads to more effective knowledge transfer, paving the way for enhanced model performance through distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IntelliSys 2025</p></details> | None |

However, as Defazio & Bottou (2019) highlight, its effectiveness in deep learning is yet to be proven. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of SVRG in optimizing real-world neural networks. Our empirical analysis finds that, for deeper neural networks, the strength of the variance reduction term in SVRG should be smaller and decrease as training progresses. Inspired by this, we introduce a multiplicative coefficient $\alpha$ to control the strength and adjust it through a linear decay schedule. We name our method $\alpha$-SVRG. Our results show $\alpha$-SVRG better optimizes models, consistently reducing training loss compared to the baseline and standard SVRG across various model architectures and multiple image classification datasets. We hope our findings encourage further exploration into variance reduction techniques in deep learning.

| **[Do Vision Models Develop Human-Like Progressive Difficulty Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13058v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a human undertakes a test, their responses likely follow a pattern: if they answered an easy question $(2 \times 3)$ incorrectly, they would likely answer a more difficult one $(2 \times 3 \times 4)$ incorrectly; and if they answered a difficult question correctly, they would likely answer the easy one correctly. Anything else hints at memorization. Do current visual recognition models exhibit a similarly structured learning capacity? In this work, we consider the task of image classification and study if those models' responses follow that pattern. Since real images aren't labeled with difficulty, we first create a dataset of 100 categories, 10 attributes, and 3 difficulty levels using recent generative models: for each category (e.g., dog) and attribute (e.g., occlusion), we generate images of increasing difficulty (e.g., a dog without occlusion, a dog only partly visible). We find that most of the models do in fact behave similarly to the aforementioned pattern around 80-90% of the time. Using this property, we then explore a new way to evaluate those models. Instead of testing the model on every possible test image, we create an adaptive test akin to GRE, in which the model's performance on the current round of images determines the test images in the next round. This allows the model to skip over questions too easy/hard for itself, and helps us get its overall performance in fewer steps.</p></details> |  | None |

Its impact spans across various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world problems present challenges in designing effective deep learning models. Consequently, several deep learning models have been developed to address different problems and applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Transformer, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN), Generative Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Deep Transfer Learning. We examine the structure, applications, benefits, and limitations of each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three publicly available datasets: IMDB, ARAS, and Fruit-360. We compared the performance of six renowned deep learning models: CNN, RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU alongside two newer models, TCN and Transformer, using the IMDB and ARAS datasets. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of eight CNN-based models, including VGG (Visual Geometry Group), Inception, ResNet (Residual Network), InceptionResNet, Xception (Extreme Inception), MobileNet, DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network), and NASNet (Neural Architecture Search Network), for image classification tasks using the Fruit-360 dataset.</p></details> | 62 pages, 37 figures | None |

However, black-box adversarial attacks can fool image classification models without access to model structure and weights. Recent studies have reported attack success rates of over 95% with fewer than 1,000 queries. Then the question arises: whether black-box attacks have become a real threat against cloud APIs? To shed some light on this, our research indicates that black-box attacks are not as effective against cloud APIs as proposed in research papers due to several common mistakes that overestimate the efficiency of black-box attacks. To avoid similar mistakes, we conduct black-box attacks directly on cloud APIs rather than local models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR Workshop, 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods calculate the similarity between visual embedding and learnable class embeddings, which are initialized by text embeddings, for zero-shot image classification. In this work, we first analyze this process based on Bayes theorem, and observe that the core factors influencing the final prediction are the likelihood and the prior. However, existing methods essentially focus on adapting class embeddings to adapt likelihood, but they often ignore the importance of prior. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach, \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{C}lass \textbf{A}daptation (BCA), which in addition to continuously updating class embeddings to adapt likelihood, also uses the posterior of incoming samples to continuously update the prior for each class embedding. This dual updating mechanism allows the model to better adapt to distribution shifts and achieve higher prediction accuracy. Our method not only surpasses existing approaches in terms of performance metrics but also maintains superior inference rates and memory usage, making it highly efficient and practical for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Conventional approaches are predominantly model-based, typically requiring retraining or fine-tuning the model's weights to meet unlearning requirements. In this work, we approach the MU problem from a novel input perturbation-based perspective, where the model weights remain intact throughout the unlearning process. We demonstrate the existence of a proactive input-based unlearning strategy, referred to forget vector, which can be generated as an input-agnostic data perturbation and remains as effective as model-based approximate unlearning approaches. We also explore forget vector arithmetic, whereby multiple class-specific forget vectors are combined through simple operations (e.g., linear combinations) to generate new forget vectors for unseen unlearning tasks, such as forgetting arbitrary subsets across classes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the forget vector, showcasing its competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art model-based methods.

Yet, conformal prediction is not reliable under poisoning attacks where adversaries manipulate both training and calibration data, which can significantly alter prediction sets in practice. As a solution, we propose reliable prediction sets (RPS): the first efficient method for constructing conformal prediction sets with provable reliability guarantees under poisoning. To ensure reliability under training poisoning, we introduce smoothed score functions that reliably aggregate predictions of classifiers trained on distinct partitions of the training data. To ensure reliability under calibration poisoning, we construct multiple prediction sets, each calibrated on distinct subsets of the calibration data. We then aggregate them into a majority prediction set, which includes a class only if it appears in a majority of the individual sets. Both proposed aggregations mitigate the influence of datapoints in the training and calibration data on the final prediction set. We experimentally validate our approach on image classification tasks, achieving strong reliability while maintaining utility and preserving coverage on clean data. Overall, our approach represents an important step towards more trustworthy uncertainty quantification in the presence of data poisoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | None |

In this specific case, the CLIP server provided by Jina AI is used for experimentation. The research hypothesizes that as the number of ground truth and artificially introduced semantically equivalent categories increases, the labeling accuracy of ViTs improves until a theoretical maximum or limit is reached. A wide variety of image datasets were chosen to test this hypothesis. These datasets were processed through a custom function in Python designed to evaluate the model's accuracy, with adjustments being made to account for format differences between datasets. By exponentially introducing new redundant categories, the experiment assessed accuracy trends until they plateaued, decreased, or fluctuated inconsistently. The findings show that while semantic scaling initially increases model performance, the benefits diminish or reverse after surpassing a critical threshold, providing insight into the limitations and possible optimization of category labeling strategies for ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 7 figures, submitted to CVPR (feedback pending)</p></details> | None |

It is challenging to timely prevent such model-stealing attacks to achieve strong protection and maintain utility. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric detector called Account-aware Distribution Discrepancy (ADD) to recognize queries from malicious users by leveraging account-wise local dependency. We formulate each class as a Multivariate Normal distribution (MVN) in the feature space and measure the malicious score as the sum of weighted class-wise distribution discrepancy. The ADD detector is combined with random-based prediction poisoning to yield a plug-and-play defense module named D-ADD for image classification models. Results of extensive experimental studies show that D-ADD achieves strong defense against different types of attacks with little interference in serving benign users for both soft and hard-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, published in AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Previous methods to measure shape and texture biases are typically style-transfer-based and limited to DNNs for image classification. In this work, we provide a new evaluation procedure consisting of 1) a cue-decomposition method that comprises two AI-free data pre-processing methods extracting shape and texture cues, respectively, and 2) a novel cue-decomposition shape bias evaluation metric that leverages the cue-decomposition data. For application purposes we introduce a corresponding cue-decomposition robustness metric that allows for the estimation of the robustness of a DNN w.r.t. image corruptions. In our numerical experiments, our findings for biases in image classification DNNs align with those of previous evaluation metrics. However, our cue-decomposition robustness metric shows superior results in terms of estimating the robustness of DNNs. Furthermore, our results for DNNs on the semantic segmentation datasets Cityscapes and ADE20k for the first time shed light into the biases of semantic segmentation DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these issues, we propose MExD, an Expert-Infused Diffusion Model that combines the strengths of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with a diffusion model for enhanced classification. MExD balances patch feature distribution through a novel MoE-based aggregator that selectively emphasizes relevant information, effectively filtering noise, addressing data imbalance, and extracting essential features. These features are then integrated via a diffusion-based generative process to directly yield the class distribution for the WSI. Moving beyond conventional discriminative approaches, MExD represents the first generative strategy in WSI classification, capturing fine-grained details for robust and precise results. Our MExD is validated on three widely-used benchmarks-Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and BRACS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in both binary and multi-class tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 | None |

Transformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to their quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently, Mamba introduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high parallelism, enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D sequences. However, extending Mamba to vision tasks, which inherently involve 2D structures, results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D sequence processing. On the other hand, current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D structures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack of efficient parallel algorithms. In this work, we propose 2DMamba, a novel 2D selective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images into Mamba, with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator, adopting both spatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of our approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that 2DMamba improves up to 2.48% in AUC, 3.11% in F1 score, 2.47% in accuracy and 5.52% in C-index.

However, state-of-the-art methods often rely on fine-tuning techniques like prompt learning and adapter-based tuning to optimize CLIP's performance. The necessity for fine-tuning significantly limits CLIP's adaptability to novel datasets and domains. This requirement mandates substantial time and computational resources for each new dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce simple yet effective training-free approaches, Single-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (SLAC) and Two-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (TLAC), that leverages powerful Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini, for image classification. The proposed methods leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LMMs, allowing for seamless adaptation to diverse datasets and domains without the need for additional training. Our approaches involve prompting the LMM to identify objects within an image. Subsequently, the CLIP text encoder determines the image class by identifying the dataset class with the highest semantic similarity to the LLM predicted object. We evaluated our models on 11 base-to-novel datasets and they achieved superior accuracy on 9 of these, including benchmarks like ImageNet, SUN397 and Caltech101, while maintaining a strictly training-free paradigm. Our overall accuracy of 83.44% surpasses the previous state-of-the-art few-shot methods by a margin of 6.75%. Our method achieved 83.6% average accuracy across 13 datasets, a 9.7% improvement over the previous 73.9% state-of-the-art for training-free approaches.

The decoder subsequently processes these features to generate pixel-level predictions. However, due to structural differences and variations in input data, only encoders benefit from pre-learned representations from vision benchmarks such as image classification and self-supervised learning, while decoders are typically trained from scratch. In this paper, we introduce $\times$Net, which facilitates a "pre-trained encoder $\times$ pre-trained decoder" collaboration through three innovative designs. $\times$Net enables the direct utilization of pre-trained models within the decoder, integrating pre-learned representations into the decoding process to enhance performance in dense prediction tasks. By simply coupling the pre-trained encoder and pre-trained decoder, $\times$Net distinguishes itself as a highly promising approach. Remarkably, it achieves this without relying on decoding-specific structures or task-specific algorithms.

However, existing approaches still face the dilemma between global modeling and efficient computation. While the Selective State Space Model (SSM) can simulate long-range dependencies with linear complexity, it still encounters challenges in MIC, such as local pixel forgetting, channel redundancy, and lack of local perception. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet efficient vision backbone for MIC tasks, named MambaMIC. Specifically, we introduce a Local-Global dual-branch aggregation module: the MambaMIC Block, designed to effectively capture and fuse local connectivity and global dependencies. In the local branch, we use local convolutions to capture pixel similarity, mitigating local pixel forgetting and enhancing perception. In the global branch, SSM extracts global dependencies, while Locally Aware Enhanced Filter reduces channel redundancy and local pixel forgetting. Additionally, we design a Feature Modulation Interaction Aggregation Module for deep feature interaction and key feature re-localization.

In the commonly studied scenario of classification from compressed images, a key objective is to enable learning directly on entropy-coded data, thereby bypassing the computationally intensive step of data reconstruction. Conventional entropy-coding methods, such as Huffman and Arithmetic coding, are effective for compression but disrupt the data structure, making them less suitable for direct learning without decoding. This paper investigates the use of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes -- originally designed for channel coding -- as an alternative entropy-coding approach. It is hypothesized that the structured nature of LDPC codes can be leveraged more effectively by deep learning models for tasks like classification. At the receiver side, gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are trained to perform image classification directly on LDPC-coded data. Experiments on datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR show that LDPC codes outperform Huffman and Arithmetic coding in classification tasks, while requiring significantly smaller learning models. Furthermore, the paper analyzes why LDPC codes preserve data structure more effectively than traditional entropy-coding techniques and explores the impact of key code parameters on classification performance. These results suggest that LDPC-based entropy coding offers an optimal balance between learning efficiency and model complexity, eliminating the need for prior decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications (Under Review)</p></details> | None |

Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

Current paradigms predominantly rely on self-supervision within uni-modal image data, thereby neglecting the inter-modal correlations essential for effective learning of cross-modal image representations. This limitation is particularly significant for naturally grouped multi-modal data, e.g., multi-parametric MRI scans for a patient undergoing various functional imaging protocols in the same study. To bridge this gap, we conduct a novel multi-modal image pre-training with three proxy tasks to facilitate the learning of cross-modality representations and correlations using multi-modal brain MRI scans (over 2.4 million images in 16,022 scans of 3,755 patients), i.e., cross-modal image reconstruction, modality-aware contrastive learning, and modality template distillation. To demonstrate the generalizability of our pre-trained model, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks with ten downstream tasks. The superior performance of our method is reported in comparison to state-of-the-art pre-training methods, with Dice Score improvement of 0.28\%-14.47\% across six segmentation benchmarks and a consistent accuracy boost of 0.65\%-18.07\% in four individual image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce PARIC, a probabilistic framework for guiding visual attention via language specifications. Our approach enables pre-trained vision-language models to generate probabilistic reference attention maps, which align textual and visual modalities more effectively while incorporating uncertainty estimates, as compared to their deterministic counterparts. Experiments on benchmark test problems demonstrate that PARIC enhances prediction accuracy, mitigates bias, ensures consistent predictions, and improves robustness across various datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Open-Set Plankton Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11318v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers open-set recognition (OSR) of plankton images. Plankton include a diverse range of microscopic aquatic organisms that have an important role in marine ecosystems as primary producers and as a base of food webs. Given their sensitivity to environmental changes, fluctuations in plankton populations offer valuable information about oceans' health and climate change motivating their monitoring. Modern automatic plankton imaging devices enable the collection of large-scale plankton image datasets, facilitating species-level analysis. Plankton species recognition can be seen as an image classification task and is typically solved using deep learning-based image recognition models. However, data collection in real aquatic environments results in imaging devices capturing a variety of non-plankton particles and plankton species not present in the training set. This creates a challenging fine-grained OSR problem, characterized by subtle differences between taxonomically close plankton species. We address this challenge by conducting extensive experiments on three OSR approaches using both phyto- and zooplankton images analyzing also on the effect of the rejection thresholds for OSR. The results demonstrate that high OSR accuracy can be obtained promoting the use of these methods in operational plankton research. We have made the data publicly available to the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024, OOD-CV workshop paper</p></details> | None |

As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pap smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, Grand Challenge paper accepted at ISBI 2025</p></details> | None |

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> | Under Review | [Code Link](https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon) |

We argue for using Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) as the primary means of communicating DP guarantees in ML, with the full privacy profile as a secondary option in case GDP is too inaccurate. Unlike other widely used alternatives, GDP has only one parameter, which ensures easy comparability of guarantees, and it can accurately capture the full privacy profile of many important ML applications. To support our claims, we investigate the privacy profiles of state-of-the-art DP large-scale image classification, and the TopDown algorithm for the U.S. Decennial Census, observing that GDP fits the profiles remarkably well in all three cases. Although GDP is ideal for reporting the final guarantees, other formalisms (e.g., privacy loss random variables) are needed for accurate privacy accounting. We show that such intermediate representations can be efficiently converted to GDP with minimal loss in tightness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $50,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs to bridge the modalities given pre-trained unimodal encoders on ImageNet classification and misinformative news caption detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Interpretable Logic Rules from Deep Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10547v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general framework called VisionLogic to extract interpretable logic rules from deep vision models, with a focus on image classification tasks. Given any deep vision model that uses a fully connected layer as the output head, VisionLogic transforms neurons in the last layer into predicates and grounds them into vision concepts using causal validation. In this way, VisionLogic can provide local explanations for single images and global explanations for specific classes in the form of logic rules. Compared to existing interpretable visualization tools such as saliency maps, VisionLogic addresses several key challenges, including the lack of causal explanations, overconfidence in visualizations, and ambiguity in interpretation. VisionLogic also facilitates the study of visual concepts encoded by predicates, particularly how they behave under perturbation -- an area that remains underexplored in the field of hidden semantics. Apart from providing better visual explanations and insights into the visual concepts learned by the model, we show that VisionLogic retains most of the neural network's discriminative power in an interpretable and transparent manner. We envision it as a bridge between complex model behavior and human-understandable explanations, providing trustworthy and actionable insights for real-world applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as an effective approach for this problem. However, the effect of attention mechanism architecture on model performance is not well-documented for biomedical imagery. In this work, we compare different methods and implementations of MIL, including deep learning variants. We introduce a new method using higher-dimensional feature spaces for deep MIL. We also develop a novel algorithm for whole-slide image classification where extreme machine learning is combined with attention-based MIL to improve sensitivity and reduce training complexity. We apply our algorithms to the problem of detecting circulating rare cells (CRCs), such as erythroblasts, in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that nonlinearities play a key role in the classification, as removing them leads to a sharp decrease in stability in addition to a decrease in average area under the curve (AUC) of over 4%. We also demonstrate a considerable increase in robustness of the model with improvements of over 10% in average AUC when higher-dimensional feature spaces are leveraged. In addition, we show that extreme learning machines can offer clear improvements in terms of training efficiency by reducing the number of trained parameters by a factor of 5 whilst still maintaining the average AUC to within 1.5% of the deep MIL model. Finally, we discuss options of enriching the classical computing framework with quantum algorithms in the future. This work can thus help pave the way towards more accurate and efficient single-cell diagnostics, one of the building blocks of precision medicine.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Vision-Language Embeddings for Zero-Shot Learning in Histopathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10731v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot learning holds tremendous potential for histopathology image analysis by enabling models to generalize to unseen classes without extensive labeled data. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded the capabilities of ZSL, allowing models to perform tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, applying VLMs to histopathology presents considerable challenges due to the complexity of histopathological imagery and the nuanced nature of diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Resolution Prompt-guided Hybrid Embedding (MR-PHE) to address these challenges in zero-shot histopathology image classification. MR-PHE leverages multiresolution patch extraction to mimic the diagnostic workflow of pathologists, capturing both fine-grained cellular details and broader tissue structures critical for accurate diagnosis. We introduce a hybrid embedding strategy that integrates global image embeddings with weighted patch embeddings, effectively combining local and global contextual information. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive prompt generation and selection framework, enriching class descriptions with domain-specific synonyms and clinically relevant features to enhance semantic understanding. A similarity-based patch weighting mechanism assigns attention-like weights to patches based on their relevance to class embeddings, emphasizing diagnostically important regions during classification. Our approach utilizes pretrained VLM, CONCH for ZSL without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, offering scalability and reducing dependence on large annotated datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MR-PHE not only significantly improves zero-shot classification performance on histopathology datasets but also often surpasses fully supervised models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Multi-Modal Federated Learning Framework for Remote Sensing Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10262v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients) without sharing the local data of the clients. Most of the existing FL methods assume that the data distributed across all clients is associated with the same data modality. However, remote sensing (RS) images present in different clients can be associated with diverse data modalities. The joint use of the multi-modal RS data can significantly enhance classification performance. To effectively exploit decentralized and unshared multi-modal RS data, our paper introduces a novel multi-modal FL framework for RS image classification problems. The proposed framework comprises three modules: 1) multi-modal fusion (MF); 2) feature whitening (FW); and 3) mutual information maximization (MIM). The MF module employs iterative model averaging to facilitate learning without accessing multi-modal training data on clients. The FW module aims to address the limitations of training data heterogeneity by aligning data distributions across clients. The MIM module aims to model mutual information by maximizing the similarity between images from different modalities. For the experimental analyses, we focus our attention on multi-label classification and pixel-based classification tasks in RS. The results obtained using two benchmark archives show the effectiveness of the proposed framework when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. The code of the proposed framework will be available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/multi-modal-FL.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interpretable Image Classification via Non-parametric Part Prototype Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10247v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifying images with an interpretable decision-making process is a long-standing problem in computer vision. In recent years, Prototypical Part Networks has gained traction as an approach for self-explainable neural networks, due to their ability to mimic human visual reasoning by providing explanations based on prototypical object parts. However, the quality of the explanations generated by these methods leaves room for improvement, as the prototypes usually focus on repetitive and redundant concepts. Leveraging recent advances in prototype learning, we present a framework for part-based interpretable image classification that learns a set of semantically distinctive object parts for each class, and provides diverse and comprehensive explanations. The core of our method is to learn the part-prototypes in a non-parametric fashion, through clustering deep features extracted from foundation vision models that encode robust semantic information. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of explanations provided by ProtoPNets, we introduce Distinctiveness Score and Comprehensiveness Score. Through evaluation on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and Stanford Dogs datasets, we show that our framework compares favourably against existing ProtoPNets while achieving better interpretability.

Backpropagation (BP), the standard learning algorithm, relies on gradient descent and typically requires numerous iterations for convergence. In this study, we introduce Expectation Reflection (ER), a novel learning approach that updates weights multiplicatively based on the ratio of observed to predicted outputs. Unlike traditional methods, ER maintains consistency without requiring ad hoc loss functions or learning rate hyperparameters. We extend ER to multilayer networks and demonstrate its effectiveness in performing image classification tasks. Notably, ER achieves optimal weight updates in a single iteration. Additionally, we reinterpret ER as a modified form of gradient descent incorporating the inverse mapping of target propagation. These findings suggest that ER provides an efficient and scalable alternative for training neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Looking for Optimal Inductive Biases in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10065v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architectures tend to fit their data with relatively simple functions. This "simplicity bias" is widely regarded as key to their success. This paper explores the limits of this principle. Building on recent findings that the simplicity bias stems from ReLU activations [96], we introduce a method to meta-learn new activation functions and inductive biases better suited to specific tasks. Findings: We identify multiple tasks where the simplicity bias is inadequate and ReLUs suboptimal. In these cases, we learn new activation functions that perform better by inducing a prior of higher complexity. Interestingly, these cases correspond to domains where neural networks have historically struggled: tabular data, regression tasks, cases of shortcut learning, and algorithmic grokking tasks. In comparison, the simplicity bias induced by ReLUs proves adequate on image tasks where the best learned activations are nearly identical to ReLUs and GeLUs. Implications: Contrary to popular belief, the simplicity bias of ReLU networks is not universally useful. It is near-optimal for image classification, but other inductive biases are sometimes preferable. We showed that activation functions can control these inductive biases, but future tailored architectures might provide further benefits. Advances are still needed to characterize a model's inductive biases beyond "complexity", and their adequacy with the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</p></details> | None |

Despite their theoretical promise, the robustness of KANs under adversarial conditions has yet to be thoroughly examined. In this paper we explore the adversarial robustness of KANs, with a particular focus on image classification tasks. We assess the performance of KANs against standard white box and black-box adversarial attacks, comparing their resilience to that of established neural network architectures. Our experimental evaluation encompasses a variety of standard image classification benchmark datasets and investigates both fully connected and convolutional neural network architectures, of three sizes: small, medium, and large. We conclude that small- and medium-sized KANs (either fully connected or convolutional) are not consistently more robust than their standard counterparts, but that large-sized KANs are, by and large, more robust. This comprehensive evaluation of KANs in adversarial scenarios offers the first in-depth analysis of KAN security, laying the groundwork for future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Fair Federated Medical Image Classification Against Quality Shift via Inter-Client Progressive State Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09587v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the potential of federated learning in medical applications, inconsistent imaging quality across institutions-stemming from lower-quality data from a minority of clients-biases federated models toward more common high-quality images. This raises significant fairness concerns. Existing fair federated learning methods have demonstrated some effectiveness in solving this problem by aligning a single 0th- or 1st-order state of convergence (e.g., training loss or sharpness). However, we argue in this work that fairness based on such a single state is still not an adequate surrogate for fairness during testing, as these single metrics fail to fully capture the convergence characteristics, making them suboptimal for guiding fair learning. To address this limitation, we develop a generalized framework. Specifically, we propose assessing convergence using multiple states, defined as sharpness or perturbed loss computed at varying search distances. Building on this comprehensive assessment, we propose promoting fairness for these states across clients to achieve our ultimate fairness objective. This is accomplished through the proposed method, FedISM+. In FedISM+, the search distance evolves over time, progressively focusing on different states. We then incorporate two components in local training and global aggregation to ensure cross-client fairness for each state. This gradually makes convergence equitable for all states, thereby improving fairness during testing. Our empirical evaluations, performed on the well-known RSNA ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of FedISM+ over existing state-of-the-art methods for fair federated learning.

However, its complex architecture and advantages over dense models in image classification remain unclear. In previous studies, MoE performance has often been affected by noise and outliers in the input space. Some approaches incorporate input clustering for training MoE models, but most clustering algorithms lack access to labeled data, limiting their effectiveness. This paper introduces the Double-stage Feature-level Clustering and Pseudo-labeling-based Mixture of Experts (DFCP-MoE) framework, which consists of input feature extraction, feature-level clustering, and a computationally efficient pseudo-labeling strategy. This approach reduces the impact of noise and outliers while leveraging a small subset of labeled data to label a large portion of unlabeled inputs. We propose a conditional end-to-end joint training method that improves expert specialization by training the MoE model on well-labeled, clustered inputs. Unlike traditional MoE and dense models, the DFCP-MoE framework effectively captures input space diversity, leading to competitive inference results. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets for multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 1 Figure, and 3 Tables</p></details> | None |

However, they often require large amounts of data and can exhibit biases that limit their robustness and generalizability. This paper introduces ForAug, a novel data augmentation scheme that addresses these challenges and explicitly includes inductive biases, which commonly are part of the neural network architecture, into the training data. ForAug is constructed by using pretrained foundation models to separate and recombine foreground objects with different backgrounds, enabling fine-grained control over image composition during training. It thus increases the data diversity and effective number of training samples. We demonstrate that training on ForNet, the application of ForAug to ImageNet, significantly improves the accuracy of ViTs and other architectures by up to 4.5 percentage points (p.p.) on ImageNet and 7.3 p.p. on downstream tasks. Importantly, ForAug enables novel ways of analyzing model behavior and quantifying biases. Namely, we introduce metrics for background robustness, foreground focus, center bias, and size bias and show that training on ForNet substantially reduces these biases compared to training on ImageNet. In summary, ForAug provides a valuable tool for analyzing and mitigating biases, enabling the development of more robust and reliable computer vision models.

Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) exploit it to obtain confidential information about the data used for training, aiming to steal information. They can be repurposed as a measurement of data integrity by inferring whether it was used to train a machine learning model. While state-of-the-art attacks achieve a significant privacy leakage, their requirements are not feasible enough, hindering their role as practical tools to assess the magnitude of the privacy risk. Moreover, the most appropriate evaluation metric of MIA, the True Positive Rate at low False Positive Rate lacks interpretability. We claim that the incorporation of Few-Shot Learning techniques to the MIA field and a proper qualitative and quantitative privacy evaluation measure should deal with these issues. In this context, our proposal is twofold. We propose a Few-Shot learning based MIA, coined as the FeS-MIA model, which eases the evaluation of the privacy breach of a deep learning model by significantly reducing the number of resources required for the purpose. Furthermore, we propose an interpretable quantitative and qualitative measure of privacy, referred to as Log-MIA measure. Jointly, these proposals provide new tools to assess the privacy leakage and to ease the evaluation of the training data integrity of deep learning models, that is, to analyze the privacy breach of a deep learning model. Experiments carried out with MIA over image classification and language modeling tasks and its comparison to the state-of-the-art show that our proposals excel at reporting the privacy leakage of a deep learning model with little extra information.</p></details> |  | None |

While VRD research is dependent on increasingly sophisticated and cumbersome models, the field has neglected to study efficiency via model compression. Here, we design a KD experimentation methodology for more lean, performant models on document understanding (DU) tasks that are integral within larger task pipelines. We carefully selected KD strategies (response-based, feature-based) for distilling knowledge to and from backbones with different architectures (ResNet, ViT, DiT) and capacities (base, small, tiny). We study what affects the teacher-student knowledge gap and find that some methods (tuned vanilla KD, MSE, SimKD with an apt projector) can consistently outperform supervised student training. Furthermore, we design downstream task setups to evaluate covariate shift and the robustness of distilled DLA models on zero-shot layout-aware document visual question answering (DocVQA). DLA-KD experiments result in a large mAP knowledge gap, which unpredictably translates to downstream robustness, accentuating the need to further explore how to efficiently obtain more semantic document layout awareness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICDAR 2024 (Athens, Greece)</p></details> | None |

However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL. This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model. Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists. This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning. Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration. Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them. Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN). Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics.</p></details> | summited to ICCV2025 | None |

Their performances largely depend on the prompt quality. While recent methods show that visual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) enhance the generalization of VLMs, class-specific prompts may be inaccurate or lack discrimination due to the hallucination in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to find visually discriminative prompts for fine-grained categories with minimal supervision and no human-in-the-loop. An evolution-based algorithm is proposed to progressively optimize language prompts from task-specific templates to class-specific descriptions. Unlike optimizing templates, the search space shows an explosion in class-specific candidate prompts. This increases prompt generation costs, iterative times, and the overfitting problem. To this end, we first introduce several simple yet effective edit-based and evolution-based operations to generate diverse candidate prompts by one-time query of LLMs. Then, two sampling strategies are proposed to find a better initial search point and reduce traversed categories, saving iteration costs. Moreover, we apply a novel fitness score with entropy constraints to mitigate overfitting. In a challenging one-shot image classification setting, our method outperforms existing textual prompt-based methods and improves LLM-generated description methods across 13 datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our optimal prompts improve adapter-based methods and transfer effectively across different backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> | None |

Instance-level examinations, such as attribution techniques, are commonly employed to interpret the model decisions. However, when interpreting misclassified decisions, human intervention may be required. Analyzing the attribu tions across each class within one instance can be particularly labor intensive and influenced by the bias of the human interpreter. In this paper, we present a novel framework to uncover the weakness of the classifier via counterfactual examples. A prober is introduced to learn the correctness of the classifier's decision in terms of binary code-hit or miss. It enables the creation of the counterfactual example concerning the prober's decision. We test the performance of our prober's misclassification detection and verify its effectiveness on the image classification benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by generating counterfactuals that penetrate the prober, we demonstrate that our framework effectively identifies vulnerabilities in the target classifier without relying on label information on the MNIST dataset.</p></details> | ICPRAI 2024 | None |
| **[BiomedCoOp: Learning to Prompt for Biomedical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15232v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated substantial success in self-supervised representation learning for vision tasks. However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images, typically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts, and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in generalizability. Meanwhile, explorations in prompt learning for biomedical image analysis are still highly limited. In this work, we propose BiomedCoOp, a novel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP for accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification. Our approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic consistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We conducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical datasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/BiomedCoOp.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/BiomedCoOp) |
| **[Measuring directional bias amplification in image captions using predictability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07878v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases but can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</p></details> |  | None |

Such architectures require large data sets and rely on convolution and self-attention operations. In 2021, MLP-Mixer emerged, an architecture that relies only on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and achieves extremely competitive results when compared to CNNs and ViTs. Despite its good performance in computer vision tasks, the MLP-Mixer architecture may not be suitable for refined feature extraction in images. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was proposed as a promising alternative to MLP models. KANs promise to improve accuracy and interpretability when compared to MLPs. Therefore, the present work aims to design a new mixer-based architecture, called KAN-Mixers, using KANs as main layers and evaluate its performance, in terms of several performance metrics, in the image classification task. As main results obtained, the KAN-Mixers model was superior to the MLP, MLP-Mixer and KAN models in the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with 0.9030 and 0.6980 of average accuracy, respectively.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

This paper presents an overview of generalizable and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging, aimed at addressing the urgent need for transparency and explainability in clinical applications. Methodology. We propose to use four CNNs in three medical datasets (brain tumor, skin cancer, and chest x-ray) for medical image classification tasks. In addition, we perform paired t-tests to show the significance of the differences observed between different methods. Furthermore, we propose to combine ResNet50 with five common XAI techniques to obtain explainable results for model prediction, aiming at improving model transparency. We also involve a quantitative metric (confidence increase) to evaluate the usefulness of XAI techniques. Key findings. The experimental results indicate that ResNet50 can achieve feasible accuracy and F1 score in all datasets (e.g., 86.31\% accuracy in skin cancer). Furthermore, the findings show that while certain XAI methods, such as XgradCAM, effectively highlight relevant abnormal regions in medical images, others, like EigenGradCAM, may perform less effectively in specific scenarios. In addition, XgradCAM indicates higher confidence increase (e.g., 0.12 in glioma tumor) compared to GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08). Implications. Based on the experimental results and recent advancements, we outline future research directions to enhance the robustness and generalizability of DL models in the field of biomedical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering</p></details> | None |

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

| **[Tangentially Aligned Integrated Gradients for User-Friendly Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08240v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated gradients is prevalent within machine learning to address the black-box problem of neural networks. The explanations given by integrated gradients depend on a choice of base-point. The choice of base-point is not a priori obvious and can lead to drastically different explanations. There is a longstanding hypothesis that data lies on a low dimensional Riemannian manifold. The quality of explanations on a manifold can be measured by the extent to which an explanation for a point lies in its tangent space. In this work, we propose that the base-point should be chosen such that it maximises the tangential alignment of the explanation. We formalise the notion of tangential alignment and provide theoretical conditions under which a base-point choice will provide explanations lying in the tangent space. We demonstrate how to approximate the optimal base-point on several well-known image classification datasets. Furthermore, we compare the optimal base-point choice with common base-points and three gradient explainability models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the 32nd Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science</p></details> | None |

However, the high dimensionality and spectral variability of HSI data pose significant challenges for feature extraction and classification. This paper presents EnergyFormer, a transformer-based framework designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) Multi-Head Energy Attention (MHEA), which optimizes an energy function to selectively enhance critical spectral-spatial features, improving feature discrimination; (2) Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which adaptively encodes spectral and spatial dependencies to reinforce long-range interactions; and (3) Enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module (ECBAM), which selectively amplifies informative wavelength bands and spatial structures, enhancing representation learning. Extensive experiments on the WHU-Hi-HanChuan, Salinas, and Pavia University datasets demonstrate that EnergyFormer achieves exceptional overall accuracies of 99.28\%, 98.63\%, and 98.72\%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN, transformer, and Mamba-based models.

| **[Towards Million-Scale Adversarial Robustness Evaluation With Stronger Individual Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15210v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harnessing Increased Client Participation with Cohort-Parallel Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15644v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach where nodes collaboratively train a global model. As more nodes participate in a round of FL, the effectiveness of individual model updates by nodes also diminishes. In this study, we increase the effectiveness of client updates by dividing the network into smaller partitions, or cohorts. We introduce Cohort-Parallel Federated Learning (CPFL): a novel learning approach where each cohort independently trains a global model using FL, until convergence, and the produced models by each cohort are then unified using knowledge distillation. The insight behind CPFL is that smaller, isolated networks converge quicker than in a one-network setting where all nodes participate. Through exhaustive experiments involving realistic traces and non-IID data distributions on the CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST image classification tasks, we investigate the balance between the number of cohorts, model accuracy, training time, and compute resources. Compared to traditional FL, CPFL with four cohorts, non-IID data distribution, and CIFAR-10 yields a 1.9x reduction in train time and a 1.3x reduction in resource usage, with a minimal drop in test accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of EuroMLSys'25</p></details> | None |

We introduce SIC, an inherently interpretable neural network that provides local and global explanations of its decision-making process. Leveraging the concept of case-based reasoning, SIC extracts class-representative support vectors from training images, ensuring they capture relevant features while suppressing irrelevant ones. Classification decisions are made by calculating and aggregating similarity scores between these support vectors and the input's latent feature vector. We employ B-Cos transformations, which align model weights with inputs, to yield coherent pixel-level explanations in addition to global explanations of case-based reasoning. We evaluate SIC on three tasks: fine-grained classification on Stanford Dogs and FunnyBirds, multi-label classification on Pascal VOC, and pathology detection on the RSNA dataset. Results indicate that SIC not only achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art black-box and inherently interpretable models but also offers insightful explanations verified through practical evaluation on the FunnyBirds benchmark. Our theoretical analysis proves that these explanations fulfill established axioms for explanations. Our findings underscore SIC's potential for applications where understanding model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.</p></details> |  | None |

Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by employing the diagonal matrix preconditioning of the stochastic gradient during the training. Despite their widespread, second-order optimization algorithms exhibit superior convergence properties compared to their first-order counterparts e.g. Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited due to increased per-iteration computations compared to the first-order methods. We present \emph{AdaFisher}--an adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a \emph{diagonal block-Kronecker} approximation of the Fisher information matrix for adaptive gradient preconditioning. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between enhanced \emph{convergence/generalization} capabilities and computational efficiency in second-order optimization framework for training DNNs. Despite the slow pace of second-order optimizers, we showcase that AdaFisher can be reliably adopted for image classification, language modeling and stands out for its stability and robustness in hyper-parameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher \textbf{outperforms the SOTA optimizers} in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed.

In this work, we exploit an overlooked property of adversarial perturbations--their dependence on image transforms--and introduce transform-dependent adversarial attacks. Unlike traditional attacks, our perturbations exhibit metamorphic properties, enabling diverse adversarial effects as a function of transformation parameters. We demonstrate that this transform-dependent vulnerability exists across different architectures (e.g., CNN and transformer), vision tasks (e.g., image classification and object detection), and a wide range of image transforms. Additionally, we show that transform-dependent perturbations can serve as a defense mechanism, preventing sensitive information disclosure when image enhancement transforms pose a risk of revealing private content. Through analysis in blackbox and defended model settings, we show that transform-dependent perturbations achieve high targeted attack success rates, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer attacks by 17-31% in blackbox scenarios. Our work introduces novel, controllable paradigm for adversarial attack deployment, revealing a previously overlooked vulnerability in deep networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Keeping Representation Similarity in Finetuning for Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07399v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale natural images have been widely used to adapt to medical image analysis through finetuning. This is largely attributed to pretrained representations capturing universal, robust, and generalizable features, which can be reutilized by downstream tasks. However, these representations are later found to gradually vanish during finetuning, accompanied by a degradation of foundation model's original abilities, e.g., generalizability. In this paper, we argue that pretrained representations can be well preserved while still effectively adapting to downstream tasks. We study this by proposing a new finetuning method RepSim, which minimizes the distance between pretrained and finetuned representations via constraining learnable orthogonal manifold based on similarity invariance. Compared to standard finetuning methods, e.g., full finetuning, our method improves representation similarity by over 30% while maintaining competitive accuracy, and reduces sharpness by 42% across five medical image classification datasets. The code will be released.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |

Existing methods aim to tackle this problem by locating and aligning relevant local features. However, the high intra-class variability in real-world images poses significant challenges in locating semantically relevant local regions under few-shot settings. Drawing inspiration from the human's complementary learning system, which excels at rapidly capturing and integrating semantic features from limited examples, we propose the generalization-optimized Systems Consolidation Adaptive Memory Dual-Network, SCAM-Net. This approach simulates the systems consolidation of complementary learning system with an adaptive memory module, which successfully addresses the difficulty of identifying meaningful features in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, we construct a Hippocampus-Neocortex dual-network that consolidates structured representation of each category, the structured representation is then stored and adaptively regulated following the generalization optimization principle in a long-term memory inside Neocortex. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

This hybrid approach aims to achieve superior performance, with significantly reduced model complexity as a result of the enriched feature representation, requiring fewer parameters. This paper proposes a novel QViT model for biomedical image classification and investigates its performance against comparable ViTs across eight diverse datasets, encompassing various modalities and classification tasks. We assess models trained from scratch and those pre-trained using knowledge distillation (KD) from high-quality teacher models. Our findings demonstrate that QViTs outperform comparable ViTs with average ROC AUC (0.863 vs 0.846) and accuracy (0.710 vs 0.687) when trained from scratch, and even compete with state-of-the-art classical models in multiple tasks, whilst being significantly more efficient (89% reduction in GFLOPs and 99.99% in parameter number). Additionally, we find that QViTs and ViTs respond equally well to KD, with QViT pre-training performance scaling with model complexity. This is the first investigation into the efficacy of deploying QViTs with KD for computer-aided diagnosis. Our results highlight the enormous potential of quantum machine learning (QML) in biomedical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |

In this work, we take the first step towards bridging this gap by theoretically analyzing the learning dynamics of LoRA for matrix factorization (MF) under gradient flow (GF), emphasizing the crucial role of initialization. For small initialization, we theoretically show that GF converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with smaller initialization leading to lower final error. Our analysis shows that the final error is affected by the misalignment between the singular spaces of the pre-trained model and the target matrix, and reducing the initialization scale improves alignment. To address this misalignment, we propose a spectral initialization for LoRA in MF and theoretically prove that GF with small spectral initialization converges to the fine-tuning task with arbitrary precision. Numerical experiments from MF and image classification validate our findings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Task Vector Quantization for Memory-Efficient Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06921v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging enables efficient multi-task models by combining task-specific fine-tuned checkpoints. However, storing multiple task-specific checkpoints requires significant memory, limiting scalability and restricting model merging to larger models and diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose quantizing task vectors (i.e., the difference between pre-trained and fine-tuned checkpoints) instead of quantizing fine-tuned checkpoints. We observe that task vectors exhibit a narrow weight range, enabling low precision quantization (up to 4 bit) within existing task vector merging frameworks. To further mitigate quantization errors within ultra-low bit precision (e.g., 2 bit), we introduce Residual Task Vector Quantization, which decomposes the task vector into a base vector and offset component. We allocate bits based on quantization sensitivity, ensuring precision while minimizing error within a memory budget. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction show our method maintains or improves model merging performance while using only 8% of the memory required for full-precision checkpoints.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies reveal that documents from encyclopedias provide helpful auxiliary information. However, existing methods align noisy documents, entangled in visual and non-visual descriptions, with image regions, yet solely depend on implicit learning. These models fail to filter non-visual noise reliably and incorrectly align non-visual words to image regions, which is harmful to knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel multi-attribute document supervision framework to remove noises at both document collection and model learning stages. With the help of large language models, we introduce a novel prompt algorithm that automatically removes non-visual descriptions and enriches less-described documents in multiple attribute views. Our proposed model, MADS, extracts multi-view transferable knowledge with information decoupling and semantic interactions for semantic alignment at local and global levels. Besides, we introduce a model-agnostic focus loss to explicitly enhance attention to visually discriminative information during training, also improving existing methods without additional parameters. With comparable computation costs, MADS consistently outperforms the SOTA by 7.2% and 8.2% on average in three benchmarks for document-based ZSL and GZSL settings, respectively. Moreover, we qualitatively offer interpretable predictions from multiple attribute views.</p></details> |  | None |
