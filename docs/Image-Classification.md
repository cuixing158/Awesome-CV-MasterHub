| **[The Cost of Compression: Tight Quadratic Black-Box Attacks on Sketches for $\ell_2$ Norm Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16345v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dimensionality reduction via linear sketching is a powerful and widely used technique, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. We study the black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix A in $R^{k X n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors v $\in R^n$ to lower-dimensional sketches A v in $R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain approximate ell2-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch. We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using tilde(O)($k^2$) queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution (used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching matrix and to the estimator: It applies to any linear sketch and any query responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the query distribution. Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of tilde(Omega)($k^2$), achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification, highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Modal Distillation For Widely Differing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16296v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Ownership Verification of DNN Models Using White-Box Adversarial Attacks with Specified Probability Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17579v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ownership verification of deep neural network (DNN) models for image classification tasks. It allows verification of model identity by both the rightful owner and third party without presenting the original model. We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control parameters. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the identification of DNN models using adversarial attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[MAN++: Scaling Momentum Auxiliary Network for Supervised Local Learning in Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16279v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However, because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks, performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network, updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks. Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++ offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable alternative to conventional training methods.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |
| **[Quality Text, Robust Vision: The Role of Language in Enhancing Visual Robustness of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16257v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data, and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance. To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods -- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 Accepted | None |
| **[Predicting the Reliability of an Image Classifier under Image Distortion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16881v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image classification tasks, deep learning models are vulnerable to image distortions i.e. their accuracy significantly drops if the input images are distorted. An image-classifier is considered "reliable" if its accuracy on distorted images is above a user-specified threshold. For a quality control purpose, it is important to predict if the image-classifier is unreliable/reliable under a distortion level. In other words, we want to predict whether a distortion level makes the image-classifier "non-reliable" or "reliable". Our solution is to construct a training set consisting of distortion levels along with their "non-reliable" or "reliable" labels, and train a machine learning predictive model (called distortion-classifier) to classify unseen distortion levels. However, learning an effective distortion-classifier is a challenging problem as the training set is highly imbalanced. To address this problem, we propose a Gaussian process based method to rebalance the training set. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our method significantly outperforms several baselines on six popular image datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stop-band Energy Constraint for Orthogonal Tunable Wavelet Units in Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16114v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a stop-band energy constraint for filters in orthogonal tunable wavelet units with a lattice structure, aimed at improving image classification and anomaly detection in CNNs, especially on texture-rich datasets. Integrated into ResNet-18, the method enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations, yielding accuracy gains of 2.48% on CIFAR-10 and 13.56% on the Describable Textures dataset. Similar improvements are observed in ResNet-34. On the MVTec hazelnut anomaly detection task, the proposed method achieves competitive results in both segmentation and detection, outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Optimizing Canaries for Privacy Auditing with Metagradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15836v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study black-box privacy auditing, where the goal is to lower bound the privacy parameter of a differentially private learning algorithm using only the algorithm's outputs (i.e., final trained model). For DP-SGD (the most successful method for training differentially private deep learning models), the canonical approach auditing uses membership inference-an auditor comes with a small set of special "canary" examples, inserts a random subset of them into the training set, and then tries to discern which of their canaries were included in the training set (typically via a membership inference attack). The auditor's success rate then provides a lower bound on the privacy parameters of the learning algorithm. Our main contribution is a method for optimizing the auditor's canary set to improve privacy auditing, leveraging recent work on metagradient optimization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that by using such optimized canaries, we can improve empirical lower bounds for differentially private image classification models by over 2x in certain instances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is transferable and efficient: canaries optimized for non-private SGD with a small model architecture remain effective when auditing larger models trained with DP-SGD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GeMix: Conditional GAN-Based Mixup for Improved Medical Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15577v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification, yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix) |
| **[Smart Eyes for Silent Threats: VLMs and In-Context Learning for THz Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15576v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Terahertz (THz) imaging enables non-invasive analysis for applications such as security screening and material classification, but effective image classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution, and visual ambiguity. We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that requires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt two open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and one-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and interpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of ICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for resource-constrained scientific domains.

| **[DARE: Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18023v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend remarkable capabilities of text-only large language models and vision-only models, and are able to learn from and process multi-modal vision-text input. While modern VLMs perform well on a number of standard image classification and image-text matching tasks, they still struggle with a number of crucial vision-language (VL) reasoning abilities such as counting and spatial reasoning. Moreover, while they might be very brittle to small variations in instructions and/or evaluation protocols, existing benchmarks fail to evaluate their robustness (or rather the lack of it). In order to couple challenging VL scenarios with comprehensive robustness evaluation, we introduce DARE, Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation, a carefully created and curated multiple-choice VQA benchmark. DARE evaluates VLM performance on five diverse categories and includes four robustness-oriented evaluations based on the variations of: prompts, the subsets of answer options, the output format and the number of correct answers. Among a spectrum of other findings, we report that state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle with questions in most categories and are unable to consistently deliver their peak performance across the tested robustness evaluations. The worst case performance across the subsets of options is up to 34% below the performance in the standard case. The robustness of the open-source VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6 and Idefics2 cannot match the closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini, but even the latter remain very brittle to different variations.</p></details> |  | None |

Verifying specific input-output properties can be a highly challenging task due to the lack of a single, self-contained framework that allows a complete range of verification types. To this end, we present \texttt{ModelVerification.jl (MV)}, the first comprehensive, cutting-edge toolbox that contains a suite of state-of-the-art methods for verifying different types of DNNs and safety specifications. This versatile toolbox is designed to empower developers and machine learning practitioners with robust tools for verifying and ensuring the trustworthiness of their DNN models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HaSPeR: An Image Repository for Hand Shadow Puppet Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10360v7)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand shadow puppetry, also known as shadowgraphy or ombromanie, is a form of theatrical art and storytelling where hand shadows are projected onto flat surfaces to create illusions of living creatures. The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process and explore architectural improvements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches.

| **[Probabilistic smooth attention for deep multiple instance learning in medical imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14932v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic-Aware Representation Learning for Multi-label Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14918v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label image classification, an important research area in computer vision, focuses on identifying multiple labels or concepts within an image. Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn image representation. However, this representation may contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image representation. Finally, a regional score aggregation strategy is used for multi-label prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of SARL over existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Tsetlin Machine Goes Deep: Logical Learning and Reasoning With Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14874v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern recognition with concise and flat AND-rules makes the Tsetlin Machine (TM) both interpretable and efficient, while the power of Tsetlin automata enables accuracy comparable to deep learning on an increasing number of datasets. We introduce the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GraphTM) for learning interpretable deep clauses from graph-structured input. Moving beyond flat, fixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences, grids, relations, and multimodality. Through message passing, the GraphTM builds nested deep clauses to recognize sub-graph patterns with exponentially fewer clauses, increasing both interpretability and data utilization. For image classification, GraphTM preserves interpretability and achieves 3.86%-points higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 than a convolutional TM. For tracking action coreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms other reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points. In recommendation systems, it tolerates increasing noise to a greater extent than a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), e.g., for noise ratio 0.1, GraphTM obtains accuracy 89.86% compared to GCN's 70.87%. Finally, for viral genome sequence data, GraphTM is competitive with BiLSTM-CNN and GCN accuracy-wise, training 2.5x faster than GCN. The GraphTM's application to these varied fields demonstrates how graph representation learning and deep clauses bring new possibilities for TM learning.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[A Mathematical Framework and a Suite of Learning Techniques for Neural-Symbolic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09693v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) systems is growing rapidly. Proposed approaches show great promise in achieving symbiotic unions of neural and symbolic methods. However, a unifying framework is needed to organize common NeSy modeling patterns and develop general learning approaches. In this paper, we introduce Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models (NeSy-EBMs), a unifying mathematical framework for discriminative and generative NeSy modeling. Importantly, NeSy-EBMs allow the derivation of general expressions for gradients of prominent learning losses, and we introduce a suite of four learning approaches that leverage methods from multiple domains, including bilevel and stochastic policy optimization. Finally, we ground the NeSy-EBM framework with Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), an open-source NeSy-EBM library designed for scalability and expressivity, facilitating the real-world application of NeSy systems. Through extensive empirical analysis across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the practical advantages of NeSy-EBMs in various tasks, including image classification, graph node labeling, autonomous vehicle situation awareness, and question answering.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Optimal Task Order for Continual Learning of Multiple Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03350v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning of multiple tasks remains a major challenge for neural networks. Here, we investigate how task order influences continual learning and propose a strategy for optimizing it. Leveraging a linear teacher-student model with latent factors, we derive an analytical expression relating task similarity and ordering to learning performance. Our analysis reveals two principles that hold under a wide parameter range: (1) tasks should be arranged from the least representative to the most typical, and (2) adjacent tasks should be dissimilar. We validate these rules on both synthetic data and real-world image classification datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), demonstrating consistent performance improvements in both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Our work thus presents a generalizable framework for task-order optimization in task-incremental continual learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Performance comparison of medical image classification systems using TensorFlow Keras, PyTorch, and JAX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14587v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high potential in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of blood image analysis. However, a detailed performance analysis of specific deep learning frameworks appears to be lacking. This paper compares the performance of three popular deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow with Keras, PyTorch, and JAX, in classifying blood cell images from the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset. The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the efficiency of these frameworks for medical image classification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Classification of Histopathology Slides with Persistence Homology Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14378v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a standard tool for computer vision tasks such as image classification. However, typical model architectures may result in the loss of topological information. In specific domains such as histopathology, topology is an important descriptor that can be used to distinguish between disease-indicating tissue by analyzing the shape characteristics of cells. Current literature suggests that reintroducing topological information using persistent homology can improve medical diagnostics; however, previous methods utilize global topological summaries which do not contain information about the locality of topological features. To address this gap, we present a novel method that generates local persistent homology-based data using a modified version of the convolution operator called Persistent Homology Convolutions. This method captures information about the locality and translation invariance of topological features. We perform a comparative study using various representations of histopathology slides and find that models trained with persistent homology convolutions outperform conventionally trained models and are less sensitive to hyperparameters. These results indicate that persistent homology convolutions extract meaningful geometric information from the histopathology slides.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Defending Against Unforeseen Failure Modes with Latent Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05030v5)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive diagnostics and debugging by developers, AI systems sometimes exhibit harmful unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is so large -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may elicit harmful behaviors. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to improve robustness, however, they empirically struggle to fix failure modes that differ from the attacks used during training. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without leveraging knowledge of what they are or using inputs that elicit them. LAT makes use of the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. Here, we use it to defend against failure modes without examples that elicit them. Specifically, we use LAT to remove backdoors and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness to novel attacks and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>See a...</summary><p>See also followup work at arXiv:2407.15549</p></details> | None |
| **[Quantum Boltzmann Machines using Parallel Annealing for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14116v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM executions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures (10 if counting subfigures), 2 tables.

| **[Foundation Models as Class-Incremental Learners for Dermatological Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14050v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models (FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization, replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the MICCAI EMERGE 2025 workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[Automatic Classification and Segmentation of Tunnel Cracks Based on Deep Learning and Visual Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14010v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency, this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS) of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively, which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Revisiting Data Augmentation for Ultrasound Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13193v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is a widely used and effective technique to improve the generalization performance of deep neural networks. Yet, despite often facing limited data availability when working with medical images, it is frequently underutilized. This appears to come from a gap in our collective understanding of the efficacy of different augmentation techniques across different tasks and modalities. One modality where this is especially true is ultrasound imaging. This work addresses this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of different augmentation techniques at improving model performance across a wide range of ultrasound image analysis tasks. To achieve this, we introduce a new standardized benchmark of 14 ultrasound image classification and semantic segmentation tasks from 10 different sources and covering 11 body regions. Our results demonstrate that many of the augmentations commonly used for tasks on natural images are also effective on ultrasound images, even more so than augmentations developed specifically for ultrasound images in some cases. We also show that diverse augmentation using TrivialAugment, which is widely used for natural images, is also effective for ultrasound images. Moreover, our proposed methodology represents a structured approach for assessing various data augmentations that can be applied to other contexts and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Transacations of Machine Learning Research (TMLR, 2025), see https://openreview.net/forum?id=iGcxlTLIL5 .

| **[Mind the Modality Gap: Towards a Remote Sensing Vision-Language Model via Cross-modal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09816v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) is undergoing a paradigm shift with the emergence of foundation models. In this work, we focus on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a Vision-Language foundation model that achieves high accuracy across various image classification tasks and often rivals fully supervised baselines, despite not being explicitly trained for those tasks. Nevertheless, there are still domains where zero-shot CLIP performance is far from optimal, such as Remote Sensing (RS) and medical imagery. These domains do not only exhibit fundamentally different distributions compared to natural images, but also commonly rely on complementary modalities, beyond RGB, to derive meaningful insights. To this end, we propose a methodology to align distinct RS image modalities with the visual and textual modalities of CLIP. Our two-stage procedure addresses the aforementioned distribution shift, extends the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP and enriches CLIP's shared embedding space with domain-specific knowledge. Initially, we robustly fine-tune CLIP according to the PAINT (Ilharco et al., 2022) patching protocol, in order to deal with the distribution shift. Building upon this foundation, we facilitate the cross-modal alignment of a RS modality encoder by distilling knowledge from the CLIP visual and textual encoders. We empirically show that both patching and cross-modal alignment translate to significant performance gains, across several RS imagery classification and cross-modal retrieval benchmark datasets. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without the reliance on textual descriptions, without introducing any task-specific parameters, without training from scratch and without catastrophic forgetting.

In this study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns, diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image classification and computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce SIC, an inherently interpretable neural network that provides local and global explanations of its decision-making process. Leveraging the concept of case-based reasoning, SIC extracts class-representative support vectors from training images, ensuring they capture relevant features while suppressing irrelevant ones. Classification decisions are made by calculating and aggregating similarity scores between these support vectors and the input's latent feature vector. We employ B-Cos transformations, which align model weights with inputs, to yield coherent pixel-level explanations in addition to global explanations of case-based reasoning. We evaluate SIC on three tasks: fine-grained classification on Stanford Dogs and FunnyBirds, multi-label classification on Pascal VOC, and pathology detection on the RSNA dataset. Results indicate that SIC not only achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art black-box and inherently interpretable models but also offers insightful explanations verified through practical evaluation on the FunnyBirds benchmark. Our theoretical analysis proves that these explanations fulfill established axioms for explanations. Our findings underscore SIC's potential for applications where understanding model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. code available at: https://github.com/deepskies/SIDDA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/deepskies/SIDDA) |

These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with \textbf{9$\boldsymbol\times$} fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.

Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing 23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms, namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2023 with DOI: 10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00647</p></details> | None |
| **[LanePerf: a Performance Estimation Framework for Lane Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12894v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification, these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework (LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours), demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS, supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> | None |

With the development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However, existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face significant challenges when dealing with fine-grained food images that are similar in shape but subtle in detail. To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for classifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet), specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

This has sparked growing interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2 across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation. This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation models in distributed resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Existing methods mainly use visual information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue, this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA) module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes, amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set samples, making it superior to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ChinaMM and recommended to Displays</p></details> | None |

However, fine-tuning the entire parameter set of a pre-trained model is costly. Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has recently emerged as a cost-effective alternative for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Despite its advantages, the increasing model size and input resolution present challenges for PETL, as the training memory consumption is not reduced as effectively as the parameter usage. In this paper, we introduce Fine-grained Prompt Tuning plus (FPT+), a PETL method designed for high-resolution medical image classification, which significantly reduces the training memory consumption compared to other PETL methods. FPT+ performs transfer learning by training a lightweight side network and accessing pre-trained knowledge from a large pre-trained model (LPM) through fine-grained prompts and fusion modules. Specifically, we freeze the LPM of interest and construct a learnable lightweight side network. The frozen LPM processes high-resolution images to extract fine-grained features, while the side network employs corresponding down-sampled low-resolution images to minimize the memory usage. To enable the side network to leverage pre-trained knowledge, we propose fine-grained prompts and fusion modules, which collaborate to summarize information through the LPM's intermediate activations. We evaluate FPT+ on eight medical image datasets of varying sizes, modalities, and complexities. Experimental results demonstrate that FPT+ outperforms other PETL methods, using only 1.03% of the learnable parameters and 3.18% of the memory required for fine-tuning an entire ViT-B model.

One of the possible reasons is the lack of available research resources that can be used for the purpose of hypernetwork research. Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5 neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10 classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms.

| **[Problem-dependent convergence bounds for randomized linear gradient compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12898v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In distributed optimization, the communication of model updates can be a performance bottleneck. Consequently, gradient compression has been proposed as a means of increasing optimization throughput. In general, due to information loss, compression introduces a penalty on the number of iterations needed to reach a solution. In this work, we investigate how the iteration penalty depends on the interaction between compression and problem structure, in the context of non-convex stochastic optimization. We focus on linear schemes, where compression and decompression can be modeled as multiplication with a random matrix. We consider several distributions of matrices, among them Haar-distributed orthogonal matrices and matrices with random Gaussian entries. We find that the impact of compression on convergence can be quantified in terms of a smoothness matrix associated with the objective function, using a norm defined by the compression scheme. The analysis reveals that in certain cases, compression performance is related to low-rank structure or other spectral properties of the problem and our bounds predict that the penalty introduced by compression is significantly reduced compared to worst-case bounds that only consider the compression level, ignoring problem data. We verify the theoretical findings experimentally, including fine-tuning an image classification model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards an Optimal Bound for the Interleaving Distance on Mapper Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03865v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapper graphs are a widely used tool in topological data analysis and visualization. They can be viewed as discrete approximations of Reeb graphs, offering insight into the shape and connectivity of complex data. Given a high-dimensional point cloud $\mathbb{X}$ equipped with a function $f: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{R}$, a mapper graph provides a summary of the topological structure of $\mathbb{X}$ induced by $f$, where each node represents a local neighborhood, and edges connect nodes whose corresponding neighborhoods overlap. Our focus is the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, arising from a discretization of the version for Reeb graphs, which is NP-hard to compute. This distance quantifies the similarity between two mapper graphs by measuring the extent to which they must be ``stretched" to become comparable. Recent work introduced a loss function that provides an upper bound on the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, which evaluates how far a given assignment is from being a true interleaving. Finding the loss is computationally tractable, offering a practical way to estimate the distance. In this paper, we employ a categorical formulation of mapper graphs and develop the first framework for computing the associated loss function. Since the quality of the bound depends on the chosen assignment, we optimize this loss function by formulating the problem of finding the best assignment as an integer linear programming problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our optimization, we apply it to small mapper graphs where the interleaving distance is known, demonstrating that the optimized upper bound successfully matches the interleaving distance in these cases. Additionally, we conduct an experiment on the MPEG-7 dataset, computing the pairwise optimal loss on a collection of mapper graphs derived from images and leveraging the distance bound for image classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixin...</summary><p>Fixing typos in Defn 2.5; added an experiment</p></details> | None |

We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.</p></details> |  | None |

The TM is an emerging machine learning algorithm founded on propositional logic, utilizing sub-pattern recognition expressions called clauses. The accelerator implements the coalesced TM version with convolution, and classifies booleanized images of 28$\times$28 pixels with 10 categories. A configuration with 128 clauses is used in a highly parallel architecture. Fast clause evaluation is achieved by keeping all clause weights and Tsetlin automata (TA) action signals in registers. The chip is implemented in a 65 nm low-leakage CMOS technology, and occupies an active area of 2.7 mm$^2$. At a clock frequency of 27.8 MHz, the accelerator achieves 60.3k classifications per second, and consumes 8.6 nJ per classification. This demonstrates the energy-efficiency of the TM, which was the main motivation for developing this chip. The latency for classifying a single image is 25.4 $\mu$s which includes system timing overhead. The accelerator achieves 97.42%, 84.54% and 82.55% test accuracies for the datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Kuzushiji-MNIST, respectively, matching the TM software models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

Among various NNW approaches, weight-based methods are favored for their simplicity and practicality; however, they remain vulnerable to forging and overwriting attacks. To address those challenges, we propose NeuralMark, a robust method built around a hashed watermark filter. Specifically, we utilize a hash function to generate an irreversible binary watermark from a secret key, which is then used as a filter to select the model parameters for embedding. This design cleverly intertwines the embedding parameters with the hashed watermark, providing a robust defense against both forging and overwriting attacks. An average pooling is also incorporated to resist fine-tuning and pruning attacks. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into various neural network architectures, ensuring broad applicability. Theoretically, we analyze its security boundary. Empirically, we verify its effectiveness and robustness across 13 distinct Convolutional and Transformer architectures, covering five image classification tasks and one text generation task.

We observe that MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural images as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the texture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the strategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) feature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training framework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM captures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss helps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation to convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed GLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms the current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection from ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by 3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by 0.6%.

Early and accurate detection of dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on advancing healthcare technology.</p></details> |  | None |

While CLIP has demonstrated impressive capabilities in general computer vision tasks, its direct application to manufacturing inspection presents challenges due to the domain gap between its training data and industrial applications. We evaluate CLIP's effectiveness through five case studies: metallic pan surface inspection, 3D printing extrusion profile analysis, stochastic textured surface evaluation, automotive assembly inspection, and microstructure image classification. Our results show that CLIP can achieve high classification accuracy with relatively small learning sets (50-100 examples per class) for single-component and texture-based applications. However, the performance degrades with complex multi-component scenes. We provide a practical implementation framework that enables quality engineers to quickly assess CLIP's suitability for their specific applications before pursuing more complex solutions. This work establishes CLIP-based few-shot learning as an effective baseline approach that balances implementation simplicity with robust performance, demonstrated in several manufacturing quality control applications.</p></details> | 36 pages, 13 figures | None |
| **[FTCFormer: Fuzzy Token Clustering Transformer for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10283v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions, regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets, 1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55% on four remote sensing datasets.

It has been shown that, in comparison to regular DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Close collaboration between medical professionals and machine learning practitioners has significantly advanced medical image analysis. However, traditional collaboration modes struggle to facilitate effective feedback between physicians and AI models, as integrating medical expertise into the training process via engineers can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce MEDebiaser, an interactive system enabling physicians to directly refine AI models using local explanations. By combining prediction with attention loss functions and employing a customized ranking strategy to alleviate scalability, MEDebiaser allows physicians to mitigate biases without technical expertise, reducing reliance on engineers, and thus enhancing more direct human-AI feedback. Our mechanism and user studies demonstrate that it effectively reduces biases, improves usability, and enhances collaboration efficiency, providing a practical solution for integrating medical expertise into AI-driven healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |

While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks, particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation, incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous degree distributions and community structures, which are typical characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more biologically informed neural networks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, label noise, which arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric, extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for real-world medical federated learning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This challenge is often addressed through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization (MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures | None |

For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the \textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

However, NAS methods often start from scratch with each new task, making them computationally expensive and limiting their applicability. Transfer learning is a practical alternative with the rise of ever-larger pretrained models. However, it is also bound to the architecture of the pretrained model, which inhibits proper adaptation of the architecture to different tasks, leading to suboptimal (and excessively large) models. We address both challenges at once by introducing a novel and practical method to \textit{transfer supernets}, which parameterize both weight and architecture priors, and efficiently finetune both to new tasks. This enables supernet transfer learning as a replacement for traditional transfer learning that also finetunes model architectures to new tasks. Through extensive experiments across multiple image classification tasks, we demonstrate that supernet transfer learning does not only drastically speed up the discovery of optimal models (3 to 5 times faster on average), but will also find better models than running NAS from scratch. The added model flexibility also increases the robustness of transfer learning, yielding positive transfer to even very different target datasets, especially with multi-dataset pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at 4th Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs), 2025</p></details> | None |

Enforcing doubly-stochastic constraints in attention matrices has been shown to improve structure and balance in attention distributions. However, existing methods rely on iterative Sinkhorn normalization, which is computationally costly. In this paper, we introduce a novel, fully parallelizable doubly-stochastic attention mechanism based on sliced optimal transport, leveraging Expected Sliced Transport Plans (ESP). Unlike prior approaches, our method enforces doubly stochasticity without iterative Sinkhorn normalization, significantly enhancing efficiency. To ensure differentiability, we incorporate a temperature-based soft sorting technique, enabling seamless integration into deep learning models. Experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, including image classification, point cloud classification, sentiment analysis, and neural machine translation, demonstrate that our enhanced attention regularization consistently improves performance across diverse applications.

This research introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline: image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing, normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions. Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting sustainable disease management practices.

For example, a three-class classification task with class-wise error rates of 10%, 10%, and 40% has a worst-class error rate of 40%, whereas the average is 20% under the class-balanced condition. The worst-class error is important in many applications. For example, in a medical image classification task, it would not be acceptable for the malignant tumor class to have a 40% error rate, while the benign and healthy classes have a 10% error rates. To avoid overfitting in worst-class error minimization using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), we design a problem formulation for bounding the worst-class error instead of achieving zero worst-class error. Moreover, to correctly bound the worst-class error, we propose a boosting approach which ensembles DNNs. We give training and generalization worst-class-error bound. Experimental results show that the algorithm lowers worst-class test error rates while avoiding overfitting to the training set.</p></details> |  | None |

The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images, demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications in pattern recognition.</p></details> |  | None |

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.</p></details> | Pre-Print | None |

BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances, respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks. We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder (ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement (COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Our work provides important insights on the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/biomedia-mira/calibration_under_shifts</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/biomedia-mira/calibration_under_shifts) |
| **[TRIX- Trading Adversarial Fairness via Mixed Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07768v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments, building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization. Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack, demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step toward fair and effective adversarial defense.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of ``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm: One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Temporal Unlearnable Examples: Preventing Personal Video Data from Unauthorized Exploitation by Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07483v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g., YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT). However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

ARS extends the analysis of randomized smoothing using $f$-Differential Privacy to certify the adaptive composition of multiple steps. For the first time, our theory covers the sound adaptive composition of general and high-dimensional functions of noisy inputs. We instantiate ARS on deep image classification to certify predictions against adversarial examples of bounded $L_{\infty}$ norm. In the $L_{\infty}$ threat model, ARS enables flexible adaptation through high-dimensional input-dependent masking. We design adaptivity benchmarks, based on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, and show that ARS improves standard test accuracy by $1$ to $15\%$ points. On ImageNet, ARS improves certified test accuracy by up to $1.6\%$ points over standard RS without adaptivity.

| **[Mixture of Group Experts for Learning Invariant Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09265v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models effectively increase the number of parameters while maintaining consistent computational costs per token. However, vanilla MoE models often suffer from limited diversity and specialization among experts, constraining their performance and scalability, especially as the number of experts increases. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse representation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from sparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose a group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed Mixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by imposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the original MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D topographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure enables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations, thereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization. Comprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image classification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially outperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the number of experts and reduce redundancy among them. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EPIC: Efficient Prompt Interaction for Text-Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07415v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC). Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach, our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance on the MM-IMDB dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.14856</p></details> | None |

In most previous works, LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method, ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transformer-Driven Active Transfer Learning for Cross-Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18115v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification presents inherent challenges due to high spectral dimensionality, significant domain shifts, and limited availability of labeled data. To address these issues, we propose a novel Active Transfer Learning (ATL) framework built upon a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (SST) backbone. The framework integrates multistage transfer learning with an uncertainty-diversity-driven active learning mechanism that strategically selects highly informative and diverse samples for annotation, thereby significantly reducing labeling costs and mitigating sample redundancy. A dynamic layer freezing strategy is introduced to enhance transferability and computational efficiency, enabling selective adaptation of model layers based on domain shift characteristics. Furthermore, we incorporate a self-calibrated attention mechanism that dynamically refines spatial and spectral weights during adaptation, guided by uncertainty-aware feedback. A diversity-promoting sampling strategy ensures broad spectral coverage among selected samples, preventing overfitting to specific classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark cross-domain HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed SST-ATL framework achieves superior classification performance compared to conventional approaches.

However, recent studies have overemphasized co-occurrence relationships among labels, which can lead to overfitting risk on this overemphasis, resulting in suboptimal models. To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing correlative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient method that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them respectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group contains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label relationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or discriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group contains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to multiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign them from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware representation, which is more conducive to classification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and outperforms SOTA methods on multiple pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> | None |

Previous methods, such as adding noise to gradients for differential privacy, work well on large datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-100, but fail on small, imbalanced medical datasets like HAM10000. This is because the imbalanced distribution causes gradients from minority classes to be clipped and lose crucial information, while majority classes dominate. This leads the model to fall into suboptimal solutions early. To address this, we propose SAD-DPSGD, which uses a linear decaying mechanism for noise and clipping thresholds. By allocating more privacy budget and using higher clipping thresholds in the initial training phases, the model avoids suboptimal solutions and enhances performance. Experiments show that SAD-DPSGD outperforms Auto-DPSGD on HAM10000, improving accuracy by 2.15% under $\epsilon = 3.0$ , $\delta = 10^{-3}$.</p></details> |  | None |

Their effectiveness, however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity, presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and (2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based metrics--Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity--that move beyond accuracy. These metrics shed light on how different descriptor generation strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering new ways to study descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.</p></details> | VisCon @ CVPR 2025 | None |

UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation.

In this paper, we establish a rigorous relation between MoE and the self-attention mechanism, showing that each row of a self-attention matrix can be written as a quadratic gating mixture of linear experts. Motivated by this connection, we conduct a comprehensive convergence analysis of MoE models with two different quadratic gating functions, namely the quadratic polynomial gate and the quadratic monomial gate, offering useful insights into the design of gating and experts for the MoE framework. First, our analysis indicates that the use of the quadratic monomial gate yields an improved sample efficiency for estimating parameters and experts compared to the quadratic polynomial gate. Second, parameter and expert estimation rates become significantly faster when employing non-linear experts in place of linear experts. Combining these theoretical insights with the above link between MoE and self-attention, we propose a novel \emph{active-attention} mechanism where we apply a non-linear activation function to the value matrix in the formula of self-attention. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed active-attention outperforms the standard self-attention through several extensive experiments in various tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and multivariate time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pedra...</summary><p>Pedram Akbarian, Huy Nguyen, and Xing Han made equal contributions to this work</p></details> | None |

However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform, which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically, the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components. During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation. Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.</p></details> |  | None |

A challenge, however, is the effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance. Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 7 Figures | None |

However, most existing methods transform the polarimetric covariance matrix into a real- or complex-valued vector to comply with standard deep learning frameworks in Euclidean space. This approach overlooks the inherent structure of the covariance matrix, which is a complex Hermitian positive definite (HPD) matrix residing in the Riemannian manifold. Vectorization disrupts the matrix structure and misrepresents its geometric properties. To mitigate this drawback, we propose HPDNet, a novel framework that directly processes HPD matrices on the Riemannian manifold. The HPDnet fully considers the complex phase information by decomposing a complex HPD matrix into the real- and imaginarymatrices. The proposed HPDnet consists of several HPD mapping layers and rectifying layers, which can preserve the geometric structure of the data and transform them into a more separable manifold representation. Subsequently, a complex LogEig layer is developed to project the manifold data into a tangent space, ensuring that conventional Euclidean-based deep learning networks can be applied to further extract contextual features for classification. Furthermore, to optimize computational efficiency, we design a fast eigenvalue decomposition method for parallelized matrix processing. Experiments conducted on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, especially in heterogeneous regions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures | None |

Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging KAN and MLP: MJKAN, a Hybrid Architecture with Both Efficiency and Expressiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04690v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression, image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Recovering Plasticity of Neural Networks via Soft Weight Rescaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04683v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Selective Prediction via Training Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13532v4)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective Prediction is the task of rejecting inputs a model would predict incorrectly on. This involves a trade-off between input space coverage (how many data points are accepted) and model utility (how good is the performance on accepted data points). Current methods for selective prediction typically impose constraints on either the model architecture or the optimization objective; this inhibits their usage in practice and introduces unknown interactions with pre-existing loss functions. In contrast to prior work, we show that state-of-the-art selective prediction performance can be attained solely from studying the (discretized) training dynamics of a model. We propose a general framework that, given a test input, monitors metrics capturing the instability of predictions from intermediate models (i.e., checkpoints) obtained during training w.r.t. the final model's prediction. In particular, we reject data points exhibiting too much disagreement with the final prediction at late stages in training. The proposed rejection mechanism is domain-agnostic (i.e., it works for both discrete and real-valued prediction) and can be flexibly combined with existing selective prediction approaches as it does not require any train-time modifications. Our experimental evaluation on image classification, regression, and time series problems shows that our method beats past state-of-the-art accuracy/utility trade-offs on typical selective prediction benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in processing complex HSI data.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.08324, arXiv:2504.15155, arXiv:2504.13045, arXiv:2503.23472</p></details> | None |
| **[Transferring Visual Explainability of Self-Explaining Models through Task Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04380v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework. Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an \emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector. Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that, except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision, exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP, which requires 150 model inferences.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Training of Deep Networks using Guided Spectral Data Selection: A Step Toward Learning What You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04269v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training. In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS) algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation strategies.

| **[Uncertainty Quantification in the Tsetlin Machine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04175v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible improvements to current TM image classification models.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the technical challenges in plant disease recognition, including small-sample learning, leaf occlusion, illumination variations, and high inter-class similarity, this study innovatively proposes a Dynamic Dual-Stream Fusion Network (DS_FusionNet).

Experimental results demonstrate that DS_FusionNet achieves classification accuracies exceeding 90% using only 10% of the PlantDisease and CIFAR-10 datasets, while maintaining 85% accuracy on the complex PlantWild dataset, exhibiting exceptional generalization capabilities.

| **[Finetuning CLIP to Reason about Pairwise Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09721v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP are trained via contrastive learning between text and image pairs, resulting in aligned image and text embeddings that are useful for many downstream tasks. A notable drawback of CLIP, however, is that the resulting embedding space seems to lack some of the structure of its purely text-based alternatives. For instance, while text embeddings have long been noted to satisfy analogies in embedding space using vector arithmetic, CLIP has no such property. In this paper, we propose an approach to natively train CLIP in a contrastive manner to reason about differences in embedding space. We finetune CLIP so that text descriptions of differences between images correspond to their difference in image embedding space, using synthetically generated data with large language models on image-caption paired datasets. We first demonstrate that our approach yields significantly improved capabilities in ranking images by a certain attribute (e.g., elephants are larger than cats), which is useful in retrieval or constructing attribute-based classifiers, and improved zeroshot classification performance on many downstream image classification tasks. In addition, our approach enables a new mechanism for inference that we refer to as comparative prompting, where we leverage prior knowledge of text descriptions of differences between classes of interest, achieving even larger performance gains in classification. Finally, we illustrate that the resulting embeddings obey a larger degree of geometric properties in embedding space, such as in text-to-image generation.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |

Their effectiveness, however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity, presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and (2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.</p></details> | VisCon @ CVPR 2025 | None |

However, due to the ``black-box" nature of DL methods, the interpretation of the high-dimensional features extracted and the backtracking of the decision-making process based on the features are still unresolved problems. In this study, we first highlight this issue and attempt to achieve the interpretability analysis of DL-based PolSAR image classification technology with the help of Polarimetric Target Decomposition (PTD), a feature extraction method related to the scattering mechanism unique to the PolSAR image processing field. In our work, by constructing the polarimetric conceptual labels and a novel structure named Parallel Concept Bottleneck Networks (PaCBM), the uninterpretable high-dimensional features are transformed into human-comprehensible concepts based on physically verifiable polarimetric scattering mechanisms. Then, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is used to replace Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for achieving a more concise and understandable mapping process between layers and further enhanced non-linear modeling ability. The experimental results on several PolSAR datasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of achieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the analytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can be obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the interpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-frequency Selected Knowledge Distillation with Statistical-based Sample Rectification for PolSAR Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03268v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their impressive performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work, we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in $n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator (MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude.

Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

Typically, satellite or airborne images used for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch) with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches. In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method.

However, existing binary ViT methods often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention. To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures, achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract 26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and 94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent (TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images. This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures | None |

Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features, thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies, comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore, the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> | None |

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |

In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism, evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.

| **[mGRADE: Minimal Recurrent Gating Meets Delay Convolutions for Lightweight Sequence Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01829v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short- and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU). This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal processing at the edge.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Are Vision Transformer Representations Semantically Meaningful? A Case Study in Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01788v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |
| **[Learning from Random Subspace Exploration: Generalized Test-Time Augmentation with Self-supervised Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01347v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Equitable Clustering: A Simple and Effective Strategy for Clustering Vision Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13337v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | None |

Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Iterative Misclassification Error Training (IMET): An Optimized Neural Network Training Technique for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02979v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular, could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples, enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However, developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process, while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed unit enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations, leading to improved image classification and anomaly detection in convolutional neural networks (CNN). When integrated into an 18-layer residual neural network (ResNet-18), the approach improved classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 2.12% and on the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) by 9.73%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained details. Similar improvements were observed in ResNet-34. For anomaly detection in the hazelnut category of the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, the proposed method achieved competitive and wellbalanced performance in both segmentation and detection tasks, outperforming existing approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/qhfan/MALA) |

Handling the low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head", akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head) |

This work implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, KI2025 - 48th German Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards the Training of Deeper Predictive Coding Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23800v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process. Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities for their application in complex tasks.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 7 figures | None |

However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the "1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Our investigation reveals the positive correlation between attention entropy and model performance. Building on this insight, we integrate AEM regularization into the MIL framework to penalize excessive attention concentration. To address sensitivity to the AEM weight parameter, we implement Cosine Weight Annealing, reducing parameter dependency.

This is a crucial capability in light of data privacy requirements, trustworthiness, and safety in deployed models. MU is particularly challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional nets or vision transformers, as such DNNs tend to memorize a notable portion of their training dataset. Nevertheless, the community lacks a rigorous and multifaceted study that looks into the success of MU methods for DNNs. In this paper, we investigate 18 state-of-the-art MU methods across various benchmark datasets and models, with each evaluation conducted over 10 different initializations, a comprehensive evaluation involving MU over 100K models. We show that, with the proper hyperparameters, Masked Small Gradients (MSG) and Convolution Transpose (CT), consistently perform better in terms of model accuracy and run-time efficiency across different models, datasets, and initializations, assessed by population-based membership inference attacks (MIA) and per-sample unlearning likelihood ratio attacks (U-LiRA). Furthermore, our benchmark highlights the fact that comparing a MU method only with commonly used baselines, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) or Successive Random Relabeling (SRL), is inadequate, and we need better baselines like Negative Gradient Plus (NG+) with proper hyperparameter selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EuroS&P 2025</p></details> | None |

We conduct comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |

These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2025</p></details> | None |

However, its effectiveness is often hindered by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images. Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to 0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.</p></details> |  | None |

Much research focuses on local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However, reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights. SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and debugging image classifiers.</p></details> |  | None |

This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of 14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST datasets, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of datasets, particularly those with subtle or noisy class distinctions (e.g., ChestMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BloodMNIST). This study represents the first systematic application of quantum-enhanced RWKV in the visual domain, offering insights into the architectural trade-offs and future potential of quantum models for lightweight and efficient vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their massive size and the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial challenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream Attention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework that combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL explicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic consistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding instance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables efficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module (FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further introduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams. Experiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior discriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Classification with Quantum-Inspired Augmentations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22241v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5 accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy and discuss the implications of this limitation.</p></details> |  | None |

Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals, including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization improvements on numerous image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed by a VLM to proactively discover, textually explain, and address conceptual gaps in a deployed predictive model.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |

Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More importantly, our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic data. Extensive experiments results show that our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

Enhancing Zero-Shot Image Classification with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15668v5)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability, an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open challenge. This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification. Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains (plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025).

QSAs are produced by replacing linear SA layers with parameterised quantum neural networks (QNNs), producing a QSA mechanism and reducing parameter scaling from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. On RetinaMNIST, our ultra parameter-efficient QViT outperforms 13/14 SOTA methods including CNNs and ViTs, achieving 56.5% accuracy, just 0.88% below the top MedMamba model while using 99.99% fewer parameters (1K vs 14.5M) and 89% fewer GFLOPs. We present the first investigation of knowledge distillation (KD) from classical to quantum vision transformers in biomedical image classification, showing that QViTs maintain comparable performance to classical ViTs across eight diverse datasets spanning multiple modalities, with improved QSA parameter-efficiency. Our higher-qubit architecture benefitted more from KD pre-training, suggesting a scaling relationship between QSA parameters and KD effectiveness. These findings establish QSA as a practical architectural choice toward parameter-efficient biomedical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for EMA4MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Counterfactual self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10. Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by self-influence alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on The Impact of Memorization on Trustworthy Foundation Models (MemFM) @ ICML 2025</p></details> | None |

We systematically evaluate the performance implications of data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500 distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding, performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.</p></details> | 20 pages, 22 figures | None |

For example, image classification tasks are input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard QR code readers.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures | None |

Current interpretability work can extract features from hidden activations over an input dataset but generally cannot explain how MLP weights construct features. One challenge is that element-wise nonlinearities introduce higher-order interactions and make it difficult to trace computations through the MLP layer. In this paper, we analyze bilinear MLPs, a type of Gated Linear Unit (GLU) without any element-wise nonlinearity that nevertheless achieves competitive performance. Bilinear MLPs can be fully expressed in terms of linear operations using a third-order tensor, allowing flexible analysis of the weights. Analyzing the spectra of bilinear MLP weights using eigendecomposition reveals interpretable low-rank structure across toy tasks, image classification, and language modeling. We use this understanding to craft adversarial examples, uncover overfitting, and identify small language model circuits directly from the weights alone. Our results demonstrate that bilinear layers serve as an interpretable drop-in replacement for current activation functions and that weight-based interpretability is viable for understanding deep-learning models.</p></details> | Accepted to ICLR'25 | None |
| **[Hierarchical Mask-Enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network for Few-Shot Fine-Grained Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20263v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations: metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features, while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12 backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning. This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the information association between the prototype and the training image patches while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods.

However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant (24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and 95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification. These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus, MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> |  | None |

Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation, which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures | None |

This limitation arises from two key factors: (1) medical images exhibit extensive anatomical variation and low contrast, necessitating a large receptive field to capture critical features, and (2) existing PEFT methods do not explicitly address the enhancement of receptive fields. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Large Kernel Adapter (LKA), designed to expand the receptive field while maintaining parameter efficiency. The proposed LKA consists of three key components: down-projection, channel-wise large kernel convolution, and up-projection. Through extensive experiments on various datasets and pre-trained models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a larger kernel size is pivotal in enhancing the adaptation of pre-trained models for medical image analysis. Our proposed LKA outperforms 11 commonly used PEFT methods, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.5% in top-1 accuracy across five medical datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, MICCAI</p></details> | None |

Alternatively, ensemble learning also improves performance, although training, storing, and deploying multiple models becomes impractical as the number of models grows. Even distilling an ensemble to a single student model or weight averaging methods first requires training of multiple teacher models and does not fully leverage the inherent stochasticity for generating and distilling diversity in DL models. These constraints are particularly prohibitive in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications such as wearable devices. This paper proposes to train only one model and generate multiple diverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. However, generating these representations stochastically leads to noisy representations that are misaligned with the learned task. To overcome this problem, a novel stochastic self-distillation (SSD) training strategy is introduced for filtering and weighting teacher representation to distill from task-relevant representations only, using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD). The student representation at each distillation step is used as authority to guide the distillation process. Experimental results on real-world affective computing, wearable/biosignal datasets from the UCR Archive, the HAR dataset, and image classification datasets show that the proposed SSD method can outperform state-of-the-art methods without increasing the model size at both training and testing time, and incurs negligible computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art ensemble learning and weight averaging methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, ML models in image classification often face significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification model used in BMW Group production facilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Our key contribution lies in a pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 14 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing defenses have focused, implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors, SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection and the case of image classification, respectively.

Most existing hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures. Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures, with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over 5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic spaces.</p></details> | 24 pages | None |

While point-to-point distances in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic \underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure (HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets. To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.</p></details> | 24 pages | None |

However, conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions. OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR performance in medical image analysis.

While many approaches have been proposed, recently the statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention, due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited practical value.</p></details> |  | None |

While computationally expensive, FHE can enable privacy-preserving neural inference in the client-server setting: a client encrypts their input with FHE and sends it to an untrusted server. The server then runs neural inference on the encrypted data and returns the encrypted results. The client decrypts the output locally, keeping both the input and result private from the server. Private inference has focused on networks with dense inputs such as image classification, and less attention has been given to networks with sparse features. Unlike dense inputs, sparse features require efficient encrypted lookup operations into large embedding tables, which present computational and memory constraints for FHE. In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities when applying FHE to Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) from both a compiler and systems perspective. DLRMs utilize conventional MLPs for dense features and embedding tables to map sparse, categorical features to dense vector representations. We develop novel methods for performing compressed embedding lookups in order to reduce FHE computational costs while keeping the underlying model performant. Our embedding lookup improves upon a state-of-the-art approach by $77 \times$. Furthermore, we present an efficient multi-embedding packing strategy that enables us to perform a 44 million parameter embedding lookup under FHE. Finally, we integrate our solutions into the open-source Orion framework and present HE-LRM, an end-to-end encrypted DLRM.

In a broad understanding, it provides adaptive control over the information flow while maintaining computational efficiency. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis on how the gating mechanism works in neural networks. In this paper, inspired by the \textit{convolution theorem}, we systematically explore the effect of gating mechanisms on the training dynamics of neural networks from a frequency perspective. We investigate the interact between the element-wise product and activation functions in managing the responses to different frequency components. Leveraging these insights, we propose a Gating Mechanism Network (GmNet), a lightweight model designed to efficiently utilize the information of various frequency components. It minimizes the low-frequency bias present in existing lightweight models. GmNet achieves impressive performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency in the image classification task.</p></details> |  | None |

This can be used to, for example, check the robustness of neural network predictions to bounded perturbations of an input. However, verifying properties concerning the preimage, i.e., the set of inputs satisfying an output property, requires abstractions in the input space. We present a general framework for preimage abstraction that produces under- and over-approximations of any polyhedral output set. Our framework employs cheap parameterised linear relaxations of the neural network, together with an anytime refinement procedure that iteratively partitions the input region by splitting on input features and neurons. The effectiveness of our approach relies on carefully designed heuristics and optimization objectives to achieve rapid improvements in the approximation volume. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, demonstrating significant improvement in efficiency and scalability to high-input-dimensional image classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Further, we showcase the application to quantitative verification and robustness analysis, presenting a sound and complete algorithm for the former and providing sound quantitative results for the latter.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2305.03686</p></details> | None |

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood cell images.

A custom dataset comprising 500 annotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from the Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five predefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally, the publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training data. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and trained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom dataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was achieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical character recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using both Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results. Subsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a ResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses: Decorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection. Furthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of illustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the analysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further advancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures; submitted to TPDL 2025</p></details> | None |

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers, such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles, directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretable predictions.To support further research, we use public datasets and provide our codebase and preprocessing pipeline under https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/VPE-in-Radiology, serving as a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 Workshop on Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models & Medical Imaging with Deep Learning 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/VPE-in-Radiology) |

This is a critical task for market organization with a tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient. Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification performance. The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

While data augmentation techniques have been widely adopted to enhance the resilience of a trained model against such perturbations, there remains significant room for improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related to the W-DRO problem.</p></details> | 26 pages,3 figures | None |

While recent transformer-based models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies, their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery. Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics.

Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T), a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data. We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP, maintaining the same empirical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs) approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks, using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on causes of highly and low interpretable features.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures | None |

Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite their utility, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector, calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Polyline Path Masked Attention for Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15940v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2, harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask, polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%, respectively.

In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 | None |

While some existing techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Thanks to the success of deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.</p></details> |  | None |

By utilizing an autoencoder that enforces an image similarity embedding in latent space, we construct an efficient kd-tree structure to order images by furthest neighbour dissimilarity in a low-dimensional embedding. From a given query image from our subsample dataset, we can identify the most dissimilar image within the global dataset in logarithmic time. Via curriculum learning, we then dynamically re-formulate an unbiased subsample dataset for NAS optimisation, upon which the current NAS solution architecture performs poorly. We show that our DDS-NAS framework speeds up gradient-based NAS strategies by up to 27x without loss in performance. By maximising the contribution of each image sample during training, we reduce the duration of a NAS training cycle and the number of iterations required for convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 si...</summary><p>27 single-column pages, 8 figures, to be published in Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |
| **[Train Once, Forget Precisely: Anchored Optimization for Efficient Post-Hoc Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14515v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning systems increasingly rely on data subject to privacy regulation, selectively unlearning specific information from trained models has become essential. In image classification, this involves removing the influence of particular training samples, semantic classes, or visual styles without full retraining. We introduce \textbf{Forget-Aligned Model Reconstruction (FAMR)}, a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient framework for post-hoc unlearning in deep image classifiers. FAMR frames forgetting as a constrained optimization problem that minimizes a uniform-prediction loss on the forget set while anchoring model parameters to their original values via an $\ell_2$ penalty. A theoretical analysis links FAMR's solution to influence-function-based retraining approximations, with bounds on parameter and output deviation. Empirical results on class forgetting tasks using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 demonstrate FAMR's effectiveness, with strong performance retention and minimal computational overhead. The framework generalizes naturally to concept and style erasure, offering a scalable and certifiable route to efficient post-hoc forgetting in vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML MUGen'25</p></details> | None |
| **[Compositional Attribute Imbalance in Vision Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14418v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual attribute imbalance is a common yet underexplored issue in image classification, significantly impacting model performance and generalization. In this work, we first define the first-level and second-level attributes of images and then introduce a CLIP-based framework to construct a visual attribute dictionary, enabling automatic evaluation of image attributes. By systematically analyzing both single-attribute imbalance and compositional attribute imbalance, we reveal how the rarity of attributes affects model performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose adjusting the sampling probability of samples based on the rarity of their compositional attributes. This strategy is further integrated with various data augmentation techniques (such as CutMix, Fmix, and SaliencyMix) to enhance the model's ability to represent rare attributes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates attribute imbalance, thereby improving the robustness and fairness of deep neural networks. Our research highlights the importance of modeling visual attribute distributions and provides a scalable solution for long-tail image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[One-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Network Similarity Directed Initialization for Pathological Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14176v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based pathological image analysis presents unique challenges due to the practical constraints of network design. Most existing methods apply computer vision models directly to medical tasks, neglecting the distinct characteristics of pathological images. This mismatch often leads to computational inefficiencies, particularly in edge-computing scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Network Similarity Directed Initialization (NSDI) strategy to improve the stability of neural architecture search (NAS). Furthermore, we introduce domain adaptation into one-shot NAS to better handle variations in staining and semantic scale across pathology datasets. Experiments on the BRACS dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, delivering both superior classification performance and clinically relevant feature localization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAFE: Finding Sparse and Flat Minima to Improve Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06866v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for real-world conditions.</p></details> | ICML 2025 | None |
| **[Synthetic-Powered Predictive Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13432v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification -- augmenting data with synthetic diffusion-model generated images -- and on tabular regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Finding Optimal Kernel Size and Dimension in Convolutional Neural Networks An Architecture Optimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14846v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PictSure: Pretraining Embeddings Matters for In-Context Learning Image Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14842v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings. In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

| **[Gatekeeper: Improving Model Cascades Through Confidence Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19335v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale machine learning models deliver strong performance across a wide range of tasks but come with significant computational and resource constraints. To mitigate these challenges, local smaller models are often deployed alongside larger models, relying on routing and deferral mechanisms to offload complex tasks. However, existing approaches inadequately balance the capabilities of these models, often resulting in unnecessary deferrals or sub-optimal resource usage. In this work we introduce a novel loss function called Gatekeeper for calibrating smaller models in cascade setups. Our approach fine-tunes the smaller model to confidently handle tasks it can perform correctly while deferring complex tasks to the larger model. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism for managing the trade-off between model performance and deferral accuracy, and is broadly applicable across various tasks and domains without any architectural changes. We evaluate our method on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. Experiments across image classification, language modeling, and vision-language tasks show that our approach substantially improves deferral performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the TTODLer-FM workshop at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025</p></details> | None |

This work evaluates the performance of Vision Transformers architectures, including Swin Transformer and MaxViT, in several datasets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. We used three training sets of images with brain, lung, and kidney tumors. Each dataset includes different classification labels, from brain gliomas and meningiomas to benign and malignant lung conditions and kidney anomalies such as cysts and cancers. This work aims to analyze the behavior of the neural networks in each dataset and the benefits of combining different image modalities and tumor classes. We designed several experiments by fine-tuning the models on combined and individual datasets. The results revealed that the Swin Transformer provided high accuracy, achieving up to 99\% on average for individual datasets and 99.4\% accuracy for the combined dataset. This research highlights the adaptability of Transformer-based models to various image modalities and features. However, challenges persist, including limited annotated data and interpretability issues. Future work will expand this study by incorporating other image modalities and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. Integrating these models across diverse datasets could mark a significant advance in precision medicine, paving the way for more efficient and comprehensive healthcare solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 12 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[SeqPE: Transformer with Sequential Position Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13277v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities, underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe) |
| **[Gradient-Guided Annealing for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20162v6)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) research has gained considerable traction as of late, since the ability to generalize to unseen data distributions is a requirement that eludes even state-of-the-art training algorithms. In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in CVPR2025.

| **[Intriguing Frequency Interpretation of Adversarial Robustness for CNNs and ViTs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12875v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention over the years, yet understanding their frequency-based characteristics remains insufficient. In this paper, we investigate the intriguing properties of adversarial examples in the frequency domain for the image classification task, with the following key findings. (1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2) The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results suggest that different network architectures have different frequency preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial and natural examples may directly influence model robustness. Based on our findings, we further conclude with three useful proposals that serve as a valuable reference to the AI model security community.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces AID (Activation by Interval-wise Dropout), a novel method inspired by Dropout, designed to address plasticity loss. Unlike Dropout, AID generates subnetworks by applying Dropout with different probabilities on each preactivation interval. Theoretical analysis reveals that AID regularizes the network, promoting behavior analogous to that of deep linear networks, which do not suffer from plasticity loss. We validate the effectiveness of AID in maintaining plasticity across various benchmarks, including continual learning tasks on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we show that AID enhances reinforcement learning performance in the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 (poster)</p></details> | None |
| **[Cross-architecture universal feature coding via distribution alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12737v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature coding has become increasingly important in scenarios where semantic representations rather than raw pixels are transmitted and stored. However, most existing methods are architecture-specific, targeting either CNNs or Transformers. This design limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where features from both architectures coexist. To address this gap, we introduce a new research problem: cross-architecture universal feature coding (CAUFC), which seeks to build a unified codec that can effectively compress features from heterogeneous architectures. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-step distribution alignment method. First, we design the format alignment method that unifies CNN and Transformer features into a consistent 2D token format. Second, we propose the feature value alignment method that harmonizes statistical distributions via truncation and normalization. As a first attempt to study CAUFC, we evaluate our method on the image classification task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-accuracy trade-offs compared to the architecture-specific baseline. This work marks an initial step toward universal feature compression across heterogeneous model architectures.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Contrastive Learning Using Out-Of-Distribution Data for Long-Tailed Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12698v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online. We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently, we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

This study evaluates the capabilities of prominent generative VLMs, such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, accessed via APIs, for histopathology image classification tasks, including cell typing. Using diverse datasets from public and private sources, we apply zero-shot and one-shot prompting methods to assess VLM performance, comparing them against custom-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our findings demonstrate that while one-shot prompting significantly improves VLM performance over zero-shot ($p \approx 1.005 \times 10^{-5}$ based on Kappa scores), these general-purpose VLMs currently underperform supervised CNNs on most tasks. This work underscores both the promise and limitations of applying current VLMs to specialized domains like pathology via in-context learning.

This has created an urgent need for a novel and energy-efficient computational fabric. CMOS Oscillator Networks (OscNet) is a brain inspired and specially designed hardware for low energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a Hopfield Network based machine learning algorithm that can be implemented on OscNet. The network is trained using forward propagation alone to learn sparsely connected weights, yet achieves an 8% improvement in accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models on MNIST dataset. OscNet v1.5 achieves competitive accuracy on MNIST and is well-suited for implementation using CMOS-compatible ring oscillator arrays with SHIL. In oscillator-based implementation, we utilize only 24% of the connections used in a fully connected Hopfield network, with merely a 0.1% drop in accuracy. OscNet v1.5 relies solely on forward propagation and employs sparse connections, making it an energy-efficient machine learning pipeline designed for CMOS oscillator computing.
