| **[Shared LoRA Subspaces for almost Strict Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06043v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Visualizing the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05849v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a neural network requires navigating a high-dimensional, non-convex loss surface to find parameters that minimize this loss. In many ways, it is surprising that optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and ADAM can reliably locate minima which perform well on both the training and test data. To understand the success of training, a "loss landscape" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LeakBoost: Perceptual-Loss-Based Membership Inference Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05748v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Probabilistic Supervision for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24162v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets without explicitly modeling predictive uncertainty. With this in mind, we propose Deep Probabilistic Supervision (DPS), a principled learning framework constructing sample-specific target distributions via statistical inference on the model's own predictions, remaining independent of hard targets after initialization. We show that DPS consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g., +2.0% for DenseNet-264 on ImageNet) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing self-distillation methods. When combined with a contrastive loss, DPS achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Feature Engineering is Not Dead: Reviving Classical Machine Learning with Entropy, HOG, and LBP Feature Fusion for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13772v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns, diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image classification and computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MaxSup: Overcoming Representation Collapse in Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15798v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

| **[Probabilistic Label Spreading: Efficient and Consistent Estimation of Soft Labels with Epistemic Uncertainty on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04574v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe artificial intelligence for perception tasks remains a major challenge, partly due to the lack of data with high-quality labels. Annotations themselves are subject to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which is typically ignored during annotation and evaluation. While crowdsourcing enables collecting multiple annotations per image to estimate these uncertainties, this approach is impractical at scale due to the required annotation effort. We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero. We present and analyze a scalable implementation of our method. Experimental results indicate that, compared to baselines, our approach substantially reduces the annotation budget required to achieve a desired label quality on common image datasets and achieves a new state of the art on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generalized Gradient Norm Clipping & Non-Euclidean $(L_0,L_1)$-Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01913v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning, which we dub Clipped Scion, and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling.

| **[Explicit Uncertainty Modeling for Active CLIP Adaptation with Dual Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04340v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ACIL: Active Class Incremental Learning for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04252v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2024 (Accepted).

| **[Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24095v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction can be used to construct prediction sets that cover the true outcome with a desired probability, but can sometimes lead to large prediction sets that are costly in practice. The most useful outcome is a singleton prediction-an unambiguous decision-yet existing efficiency-oriented methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a new nonconformity score that aims to minimize the probability of producing non-singleton sets. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency (sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on average set size.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Admissibility of Stein Shrinkage for Batch Normalization in the Presence of Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08261v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks, primarily used to improve stability and regularization during training. BN centers and scales feature maps using sample means and variances, which are naturally suited for Stein's shrinkage estimation. Applying such shrinkage yields more accurate mean and variance estimates of the batch in the mean-squared-error sense. In this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator of the mean and variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators, respectively, in the presence of adversarial attacks modeled using sub-Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, by construction, the James-Stein (JS) BN yields a smaller local Lipschitz constant compared to the vanilla BN, implying better regularity properties and potentially improved robustness. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and the use of it in image classification and segmentation tasks with and without adversarial attacks. We present SOTA performance results using this Stein-corrected BN in a standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data, and image segmentation using HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Representation Learning in Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03531v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) achieve impressive performance in image classification tasks, yet the internal representations they learn remain less understood. This work started as an attempt to understand the strong downstream classification performance of MAE. In this process we discover that representations learned with the pretraining and fine-tuning, are quite robust - demonstrating a good classification performance in the presence of degradations, such as blur and occlusions. Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Sensitivity analysis of image classification models using generalized polynomial chaos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18751v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification model used in BMW Group production facilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lipschitz Multiscale Deep Equilibrium Models: A Theoretically Guaranteed and Accelerated Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03297v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) achieve infinitely deep network representations without stacking layers by exploring fixed points of layer transformations in neural networks. Such models constitute an innovative approach that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in many large-scale numerical experiments, despite requiring significantly less memory. However, DEQs face the challenge of requiring vastly more computational time for training and inference than conventional methods, as they repeatedly perform fixed-point iterations with no convergence guarantee upon each input. Therefore, this study explored an approach to improve fixed-point convergence and consequently reduce computational time by restructuring the model architecture to guarantee fixed-point convergence. Our proposed approach for image classification, Lipschitz multiscale DEQ, has theoretically guaranteed fixed-point convergence for both forward and backward passes by hyperparameter adjustment, achieving up to a 4.75$\times$ speed-up in numerical experiments on CIFAR-10 at the cost of a minor drop in accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTATS2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Controlled disagreement improves generalization in decentralized training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02899v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized training is often regarded as inferior to centralized training because the consensus errors between workers are thought to undermine convergence and generalization, even with homogeneous data distributions. This work challenges this view by introducing decentralized SGD with Adaptive Consensus (DSGD-AC), which intentionally preserves non-vanishing consensus errors through a time-dependent scaling mechanism. We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima. Across image classification and machine translation benchmarks, DSGD-AC consistently surpasses both standard DSGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness. Together, these results establish consensus errors as a useful implicit regularizer and open a new perspective on the design of decentralized learning algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantics-Aware Generative Latent Data Augmentation for Learning in Low-Resource Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02841v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite strong performance in data-rich regimes, deep learning often underperforms in the data-scarce settings common in practice. While foundation models (FMs) trained on massive datasets demonstrate strong generalization by extracting general-purpose features, they can still suffer from scarce labeled data during downstream fine-tuning. To address this, we propose GeLDA, a semantics-aware generative latent data augmentation framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in an FM-induced latent space. Because this space is low-dimensional and concentrates task-relevant information compared to the input space, GeLDA enables efficient, high-quality data generation. GeLDA conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors that capture semantic relationships among classes or subdomains, facilitating data augmentation in low-resource domains. We validate GeLDA in two large-scale recognition tasks: (a) in zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improves the Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%; and (b) in long-tailed image classification, it achieves 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting a new state-of-the-art result.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Image Classification In Biomedical Imaging Using Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02370v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate histopathologic interpretation is key for clinical decision-making; however, current deep learning models for digital pathology are often overconfident and poorly calibrated in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, which limit trust and clinical adoption. Safety-critical medical imaging workflows benefit from intrinsic uncertainty-aware properties that can accurately reject OOD input. We implement the Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a set of lightweight modifications that apply spectral normalization and replace the final dense layer with a Gaussian process layer to improve single-model uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. We evaluate SNGP vs. deterministic and MonteCarlo dropout on six datasets across three biomedical classification tasks: white blood cells, amyloid plaques, and colorectal histopathology. SNGP has comparable in-distribution performance while significantly improving uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. Thus, SNGP or related models offer a useful framework for uncertainty-aware classification in digital pathology, supporting safe deployment and building trust with pathologists.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Prediction-Powered Risk Monitoring of Deployed Models for Detecting Harmful Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02229v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of monitoring model performance in dynamic environments where labeled data are limited. To this end, we propose prediction-powered risk monitoring (PPRM), a semi-supervised risk-monitoring approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI). PPRM constructs anytime-valid lower bounds on the running risk by combining synthetic labels with a small set of true labels. Harmful shifts are detected via a threshold-based comparison with an upper bound on the nominal risk, satisfying assumption-free finite-sample guarantees in the probability of false alarm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PPRM through extensive experiments on image classification, large language model (LLM), and telecommunications monitoring tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transferring Visual Explainability of Self-Explaining Models to Prediction-Only Models without Additional Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04380v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image classification scenarios where both prediction and explanation efficiency are required, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single inference are effective. However, for users who already have prediction-only models, training a new self-explaining model from scratch imposes significant costs in terms of both labeling and computation. This study proposes a method to transfer the visual explanation capability of self-explaining models learned in a source domain to prediction-only models in a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework. Our self-explaining model comprises an architecture that extends Vision Transformer-based prediction-only models, enabling the proposed method to endow explanation capability to many trained prediction-only models without additional training. Experiments on various image classification datasets demonstrate that, except for transfers between less-related domains, the transfer of visual explanation capability from source to target domains is successful, and explanation quality in the target domain improves without substantially sacrificing classification accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DSXFormer: Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion and Dynamic Context Attention Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01906v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) is a challenging task due to high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited labeled training samples. Although transformer-based models have shown strong potential for HSIC, existing approaches often struggle to achieve sufficient spectral discriminability while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DSXFormer, a novel dual-pooling spectral squeeze-expansion transformer with Dynamic Context Attention for HSIC. The proposed DSXFormer introduces a Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion (DSX) block, which exploits complementary global average and max pooling to adaptively recalibrate spectral feature channels, thereby enhancing spectral discriminability and inter-band dependency modeling. In addition, DSXFormer incorporates a Dynamic Context Attention (DCA) mechanism within a window-based transformer architecture to dynamically capture local spectral-spatial relationships while significantly reducing computational overhead. The joint integration of spectral dual-pooling squeeze-expansion and DCA enables DSXFormer to achieve an effective balance between spectral emphasis and spatial contextual representation. Furthermore, patch extraction, embedding, and patch merging strategies are employed to facilitate efficient multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used hyperspectral benchmark datasets, including Salinas (SA), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), demonstrate that DSXFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving classification accuracies of 99.95%, 98.91%, 99.85%, and 98.52%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Vision Transformer with Adaptive Focal Loss for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01633v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning models like Vision Transformer (ViT) have achieved significant advances, they typically require large datasets. With data privacy regulations, access to many original datasets is restricted, especially medical images. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by enabling global model aggregation without data exchange. However, the heterogeneity of the data and the class imbalance that exist in local clients pose challenges for the generalization of the model. This study proposes a FL framework leveraging a dynamic adaptive focal loss (DAFL) and a client-aware aggregation strategy for local training. Specifically, we design a dynamic class imbalance coefficient that adjusts based on each client's sample distribution and class data distribution, ensuring minority classes receive sufficient attention and preventing sparse data from being ignored. To address client heterogeneity, a weighted aggregation strategy is adopted, which adapts to data size and characteristics to better capture inter-client variations. The classification results on three public datasets (ISIC, Ocular Disease and RSNA-ICH) show that the proposed framework outperforms DenseNet121, ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-L/32, FedCLIP, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and MixNet in most cases, with accuracy improvements ranging from 0.98\% to 41.69\%. Ablation studies on the imbalanced ISIC dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function and aggregation strategy compared to traditional loss functions and other FL approaches.

Motivated by this view, we propose Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), a first-order optimization method that biases learning its dynamics toward flat basins while retaining the computational and memory efficiency of SGD and SGLD. We provide a non-asymptotic theoretical analysis showing that fSGLD converges to a flatness-biased Gibbs distribution under a theoretically prescribed coupling between the noise scale $σ$ and the inverse temperature $β$, together with explicit excess risk guarantees. We empirically evaluate fSGLD across standard optimizer benchmarks, Bayesian image classification, uncertainty quantification, and out-of-distribution detection, demonstrating consistently strong performance and reliable uncertainty estimates. Additional experiments confirm the effectiveness of the theoretically prescribed $β$-$σ$ coupling compared to decoupled choices.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches regularize representations towards isotropic Gaussian distributions, but inherently favor dense representations and fail to capture the key property of sparsity observed in efficient representations. We introduce Rectified Distribution Matching Regularization (RDMReg), a sliced two-sample distribution-matching loss that aligns representations to a Rectified Generalized Gaussian (RGG) distribution. RGG enables explicit control over expected $\ell_0$ norm through rectification, while preserving maximum-entropy up to rescaling under expected $\ell_p$ norm constraints. Equipping JEPAs with RDMReg yields Rectified LpJEPA, which strictly generalizes prior Gaussian-based JEPAs. Empirically, Rectified LpJEPA learns sparse, non-negative representations with favorable sparsity-performance trade-offs and competitive downstream performance on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating that RDMReg effectively enforces sparsity while preserving task-relevant information.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Richer Bayesian Last Layers with Subsampled NTK Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01279v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Last Layers (BLLs) provide a convenient and computationally efficient way to estimate uncertainty in neural networks. However, they underestimate epistemic uncertainty because they apply a Bayesian treatment only to the final layer, ignoring uncertainty induced by earlier layers. We propose a method that improves BLLs by leveraging a projection of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) features onto the space spanned by the last-layer features. This enables posterior inference that accounts for variability of the full network while retaining the low computational cost of inference of a standard BLL. We show that our method yields posterior variances that are provably greater or equal to those of a standard BLL, correcting its tendency to underestimate epistemic uncertainty. To further reduce computational cost, we introduce a uniform subsampling scheme for estimating the projection matrix and for posterior inference.

Empirical evaluations on UCI regression, contextual bandits, image classification, and out-of-distribution detection tasks in image and tabular datasets, demonstrate improved calibration and uncertainty estimates compared to standard BLLs and competitive baselines, while reducing computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> | None |
| **[Parallel Training in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01133v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bio-inspired integrate-fire-reset mechanism of spiking neurons constitutes the foundation for efficient processing in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Recent progress in large models demands that spiking neurons support highly parallel computation to scale efficiently on modern GPUs. This work proposes a novel functional perspective that provides general guidance for designing parallel spiking neurons. We argue that the reset mechanism, which induces complex temporal dependencies and hinders parallel training, should be removed. However, any such modification should satisfy two principles: 1) preserving the functions of reset as a core biological mechanism; and 2) enabling parallel training without sacrificing the serial inference ability of spiking neurons, which underpins their efficiency at test time. To this end, we identify the functions of the reset and analyze how to reconcile parallel training with serial inference, upon which we propose a dynamic decay spiking neuron. We conduct comprehensive testing of our method in terms of: 1) Training efficiency and extrapolation capability. On 16k-length sequences, we achieve a 25.6x training speedup over the pioneering parallel spiking neuron, and our models trained on 2k-length can stably perform inference on sequences as long as 30k. 2) Generality. We demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method across five task categories (image classification, neuromorphic event processing, time-series forecasting, language modeling, and reinforcement learning), three network architectures (spiking CNN/Transformer/SSMs), and two spike activation modes (spike/integer activation). 3) Energy consumption. The spiking firing of our neuron is lower than that of vanilla and existing parallel spiking neurons.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we unify two branches of work that have separately solved important challenges in DFL: (i) gradient tracking techniques for mitigating data heterogeneity and (ii) accounting for diverse availability of resources across clients. We propose $\textit{Sporadic Gradient Tracking}$ ($\texttt{Spod-GT}$), the first DFL algorithm that incorporates these factors over general directed graphs by allowing (i) client-specific gradient computation frequencies and (ii) heterogeneous and asymmetric communication frequencies. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis of our methodology with relaxed assumptions on gradient estimation variance and gradient diversity of clients, providing consensus and optimality guarantees for GT over directed graphs despite intermittent client participation. Through numerical experiments on image classification datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of $\texttt{Spod-GT}$ compared to well-known GT baselines.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Instance Temperature Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00115v5)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) enhances the performance of a student network by allowing it to learn the knowledge transferred from a teacher network incrementally. Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

We present a practical carbon-accounting methodology for FL CO2e tracking using NVIDIA NVFlare and CodeCarbon for explicit, phase-aware tasks (initialization, per-round training, evaluation, and idle/coordination). To capture non-compute effects, we additionally estimate communication emissions from transmitted model-update sizes under a network-configurable energy model. We validate the proposed approach on two representative workloads: CIFAR-10 image classification and retinal optic disk segmentation. In CIFAR-10, controlled client-efficiency scenarios show that system-level slowdowns and coordination effects can contribute meaningfully to carbon footprint under an otherwise fixed FL protocol, increasing total CO2e by 8.34x (medium) and 21.73x (low) relative to the high-efficiency baseline. In retinal segmentation, swapping GPU tiers (H100 vs.\ V100) yields a consistent 1.7x runtime gap (290 vs. 503 minutes) while producing non-uniform changes in total energy and CO2e across sites, underscoring the need for per-site and per-round reporting. Overall, our results support a standardized carbon accounting method that acts as a prerequisite for reproducible 'green' FL evaluation.

| **[Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22944v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains challenging when models simultaneously encounter correlation shifts across environments and diversity shifts driven by rare or hard samples. Existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods primarily address spurious correlations at the environment level, but often overlook sample-level heterogeneity within environments, which can critically impact OOD performance. In this work, we propose \emph{Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization} (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift. By integrating environment-level invariance with within-environment robustness, the proposed approach makes these two mechanisms complementary under mixed distribution shifts. We further extend the framework to scenarios without explicit environment annotations by inferring latent environments through a minimax formulation. Experiments across regression, tabular, time-series, and image classification benchmarks under mixed distribution shifts demonstrate consistent improvements in both worst-environment and average OOD performance.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters. Our results uncover several findings, notably: LoRA and its variants exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the choices of learning rate compared to other hyperparameters; moreover, with proper hyperparameter configurations, LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the performance of most of its variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Under Review</p></details> | None |

We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation. Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models. We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models. Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters). A single linear attention module reduces FLOPs by about 61 percent compared to softmax attention.

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin. The source code of MIFOMO is open-sourced in https://github.com/Naeem- Paeedeh/MIFOMO for reproducibility and convenient further study.</p></details> |  | None |

Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2025.

Its effectiveness lies in expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical: effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection, showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40 percentage points (pp) in $F_1$ score over unaugmented baselines, and 4~pp over other filtered augmentation baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks. This makes ZK-HybridFL a scalable and secure solution for decentralized FL across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> | None |

Transformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to their quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently, Mamba introduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high parallelism, enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D sequences. However, extending Mamba to vision tasks, which inherently involve 2D structures, results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D sequence processing. On the other hand, current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D structures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack of efficient parallel algorithms. In this work, we propose 2DMamba, a novel 2D selective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images into Mamba, with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator, adopting both spatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of our approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that 2DMamba improves up to 2.48% in AUC, 3.11% in F1 score, 2.47% in accuracy and 5.52% in C-index. Additionally, integrating our method with VMamba for natural imaging yields 0.5 to 0.7 improvements in mIoU on the ADE20k semantic segmentation dataset, and 0.2% accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K classification dataset.

However, SSL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary may train and distribute poisoned pre-training encoders to contaminate the downstream models. In this paper, we study a defense mechanism based on distillation against poisoned encoders in SSL. Traditionally, distillation transfers knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model to a student model, enabling the student to replicate or refine the teacher's learned representations. We repurpose distillation to extract benign knowledge and remove backdoors from a poisoned pre-trained encoder to produce a clean and reliable pre-trained model. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of distillation in mitigating backdoor attacks on pre-trained encoders. Based on two state-of-the-art backdoor attacks and four widely adopted image classification datasets, our results demonstrate that distillation reduces the attack success rate from 80.87% to 27.51%, with only a 6.35% drop in model accuracy. Furthermore, by comparing four teacher architectures, three student models, and six loss functions, we find that the distillation with fine-tuned teacher networks, warm-up-based student training, and attention-based distillation losses yield the best performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Exact posteriors are usually intractable, in which case approximations can be employed. One such approximation - variational inference - is computationally efficient when using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent as subsets of the data are used for likelihood and gradient evaluations, though the approach relies on the selection of a variational distribution which sufficiently matches the form of the posterior. Particle-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) do not assume a parametric family for the posterior by typically require higher computational cost. These sampling methods typically use the full-batch of data for likelihood and gradient evaluations, which contributes to this computational expense. We explore several methods of gradually introducing more mini-batches of data (data annealing) into likelihood and gradient evaluations of an SMC sampler. We find that we can achieve up to $6\times$ faster training with minimal loss in accuracy on benchmark image classification problems using NNs.</p></details> |  | None |

Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget.

While adaptive methods like Adam have long dominated practice, the recently proposed Muon optimizer achieves superior performance through orthogonalized momentum updates that enforce isotropic geometry with uniform singular values. However, this strict isotropy discards potentially valuable curvature information encoded in gradient spectra, motivating optimization methods that balance geometric structure with adaptivity. We introduce FISMO (Fisher-Structured Momentum-Orthogonalized) optimizer, which generalizes isotropic updates to incorporate anisotropic curvature information through Fisher information geometry. By reformulating the optimizer update as a trust-region problem constrained by a Kronecker-factored Fisher metric, FISMO achieves structured preconditioning that adapts to local loss landscape geometry while maintaining computational tractability. We establish convergence guarantees for FISMO in stochastic nonconvex settings, proving an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate for the expected squared gradient norm with explicit characterization of variance reduction through mini-batching. Empirical evaluation on image classification and language modeling benchmarks demonstrates that FISMO achieves superior training efficiency and final performance compared to established baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning.

While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings demonstrate that adversarial vulnerability is not an artifact of end-to-end differentiability but a fundamental property of image classification systems, with implications for security-critical deployments across computational paradigms.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing approaches pursue domain-invariant representations, implicitly assuming that invariance implies reliability. However, features that are invariant across domains are not necessarily causally effective for prediction. In this work, we revisit OOD classification from a causal perspective and propose to evaluate learned representations based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shift. We introduce an explicit segment-level framework that directly measures causal effectiveness across domains, providing a more faithful criterion than invariance alone. Experiments on multi-domain benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts, highlighting the value of causal evaluation for robust generalization.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

Despite offering advantages like negligible computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP (Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead during inference.

While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference.

However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures | None |

In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages,7 figures | None |

Previous Parameter-Efficient-Tuning (PET) methods regard the pre-trained model as an opaque Black Box model, relying purely on data-driven optimization and underutilizing their inherent prior knowledge. This oversight limits the models' potential for effective downstream task adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition. This knowledge is verbalized into interpretable human prompts and leveraged through a corrective knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy to guide the Black Box module toward more accurate predictions. By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation. Experimental results on 12 image classification benchmarks under few-shot and easy-to-hard adaptation settings demonstrate the effectiveness of corrective knowledge and the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Primitive-Driven Acceleration of Hyperdimensional Computing for Real-Time Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20061v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) represents data using extremely high-dimensional, low-precision vectors, termed hypervectors (HVs), and performs learning and inference through lightweight, noise-tolerant operations. However, the high dimensionality, sparsity, and repeated data movement involved in HDC make these computations difficult to accelerate efficiently on conventional processors. As a result, executing core HDC operations: binding, permutation, bundling, and similarity search: on CPUs or GPUs often leads to suboptimal utilization, memory bottlenecks, and limits on real-time performance. In this paper, our contributions are two-fold. First, we develop an image-encoding algorithm that, similar in spirit to convolutional neural networks, maps local image patches to hypervectors enriched with spatial information. These patch-level hypervectors are then merged into a global representation using the fundamental HDC operations, enabling spatially sensitive and robust image encoding. This encoder achieves 95.67% accuracy on MNIST and 85.14% on Fashion-MNIST, outperforming prior HDC-based image encoders. Second, we design an end-to-end accelerator that implements these compute operations on an FPGA through a pipelined architecture that exploits parallelism both across the hypervector dimensionality and across the set of image patches. Our Alveo U280 implementation delivers 0.09ms inference latency, achieving up to 1300x and 60x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU and GPU baselines, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the transmission speed of the satellite downlink has become a major bottleneck in certain applications, such as disaster monitoring and emergency mapping, which demand a fast response ability. We propose an efficient AI-enabled Satellite Edge Computing paradigm for hyperspectral image classification, facilitating the satellites to attain autonomous decision-making. To accommodate the resource constraints of satellite platforms, the proposed method adopts a lightweight, non-deep learning framework integrated with a few-shot learning strategy. Moreover, onboard processing on satellites could be faced with sensor failure and scan pattern errors, which result in degraded image quality with bad/misaligned pixels and mixed noise. To address these challenges, we develop a novel two-stage pixel-wise label propagation scheme that utilizes only intrinsic spectral features at the single pixel level without the necessity to consider spatial structural information as requested by deep neural networks. In the first stage, initial pixel labels are obtained by propagating selected anchor labels through the constructed anchor-pixel affinity matrix. Subsequently, a top-k pruned sparse graph is generated by directly computing pixel-level similarities. In the second stage, a closed-form solution derived from the sparse graph is employed to replace iterative computations. Furthermore, we developed a rank constraint-based graph clustering algorithm to determine the anchor labels.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, our framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment. The proposed method validates the feasibility of integrating generative augmentation with quantum-enhanced modeling in real-world medical imaging tasks, offering a novel research pathway for developing highly reliable medical AI systems in small-sample, highly imbalanced, and high-risk diagnostic scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

We systematically evaluate the performance implications of data encoding techniques, variational ansätze, and measurement in approx. 500 distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In contrast, the selection of variational ansätze and measurement basis had a comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding, performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.</p></details> | 20 pages, 22 figures | None |

However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods, however, still rely on source domain annotations and are susceptible to distribution shifts, leading to degraded generalization performance in the target domain. To address this, this paper proposes a self-supervised cross-domain transfer framework that learns transferable spectral-spatial joint representations without source labels and achieves efficient adaptation under few samples in the target domain. During the self-supervised pre-training phase, a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (S2Former) module is designed. It adopts a dual-branch spatial-spectral transformer and introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to achieve spectral-spatial collaborative modeling: the spatial branch enhances structural awareness through random masking, while the spectral branch captures fine-grained differences. Both branches mutually guide each other to improve semantic consistency. We further propose a Frequency Domain Constraint (FDC) to maintain frequency-domain consistency through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT) and high-frequency magnitude loss, thereby enhancing the model's capability to discern fine details and boundaries. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a Diffusion-Aligned Fine-tuning (DAFT) distillation mechanism. This aligns semantic evolution trajectories through a teacher-student structure, enabling robust transfer learning under low-label conditions. Experimental results demonstrate stable classification performance and strong cross-domain adaptability across four hyperspectral datasets, validating the method's effectiveness under resource-constrained conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to high annotation costs and limited sample availability, semi-supervised learning still faces challenges such as boundary label diffusion and pseudo-label instability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised hyperspectral classification framework integrating spatial prior information with a dynamic learning mechanism. First, we design an Edge-Aware Superpixel Label Propagation (EASLP) module. By integrating edge intensity penalty with neighborhood correction strategy, it mitigates label diffusion from superpixel segmentation while enhancing classification robustness in boundary regions. Second, we introduce a Dynamic History-Fused Prediction (DHP) method. By maintaining historical predictions and dynamically weighting them with current results, DHP smoothens pseudo-label fluctuations and improves temporal consistency and noise resistance. Concurrently, incorporating condifence and consistency measures, the Adaptive Tripartite Sample Categorization (ATSC) strategy implements hierarchical utilization of easy, ambiguous, and hard samples, leading to enhanced pseudo-label quality and learning efficiency. The Dynamic Reliability-Enhanced Pseudo-Label Framework (DREPL), composed of DHP and ATSC, strengthens pseudo-label stability across temporal and sample domains. Through synergizes operation with EASLP, it achieves spatio-temporal consistency optimization. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate its capability to maintain superior classification performance.</p></details> |  | None |

We present a computational methodology for systematically exploring and analyzing the relationships among convergence, pruning, and quantization. The workflow first performs a structured design sweep across a large set of architectures, then evaluates convergence behavior, pruning sensitivity, and quantization robustness on representative models. Focusing on well-known image classification of increasing complexity, and across Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Vision Transformers, our initial results show that, despite architectural diversity, performance is largely invariant and learning dynamics consistently exhibit three regimes: unstable, learning, and overfitting. We further characterize the minimal learnable parameters required for stable learning, uncover distinct convergence and pruning phases, and quantify the effect of reduced numeric precision on trainable parameters. Aligning with intuition, the results confirm that deeper architectures are more resilient to pruning than shallower ones, with parameter redundancy as high as 60%, and quantization impacts models with fewer learnable parameters more severely and has a larger effect on harder image datasets. These findings provide actionable guidance for selecting compact, stable models under pruning and low-precision constraints in image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight domain generalization framework with quantum-enhanced collaborative learning, enabling robust generalization to unseen target domains without relying on real multi-center labeled data. Specifically, a MobileNetV2-based domain-invariant encoder is constructed and optimized through three key components: (1) multi-domain imaging shift simulation using brightness, contrast, sharpening, and noise perturbations to emulate heterogeneous acquisition conditions; (2) domain-adversarial training with gradient reversal to suppress domain-discriminative features; and (3) a lightweight quantum feature enhancement layer that applies parameterized quantum circuits for nonlinear feature mapping and entanglement modeling. In addition, a test-time adaptation strategy is employed during inference to further alleviate distribution shifts. Experiments on simulated multi-center medical imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models without domain generalization or quantum enhancement on unseen domains, achieving reduced domain-specific performance variance and improved AUC and sensitivity. These results highlight the clinical potential of quantum-enhanced domain generalization under constrained computational resources and provide a feasible paradigm for hybrid quantum--classical medical imaging systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional augmentation improves robustness, but fails under substantial domain shifts. Recent advances in stylistic augmentation enhance domain generalization by varying image styles but fall short in terms of style diversity or by introducing artifacts into the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose Stylizing ViT, a novel Vision Transformer encoder that utilizes weight-shared attention blocks for both self- and cross-attention. This design allows the same attention block to maintain anatomical consistency through self-attention while performing style transfer via cross-attention. We assess the effectiveness of our method for domain generalization by employing it for data augmentation on three distinct image classification tasks in the context of histopathology and dermatology. Results demonstrate an improved robustness (up to +13% accuracy) over the state of the art while generating perceptually convincing images without artifacts.

Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods largely operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the parameters of the pre-trained model, which can lead to models that are overly specialized to the observed downstream data. Recent studies suggest that one mechanism underlying such forgetting is the introduction of intruder dimensions into the representation space during fine-tuning. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and to enhance robustness, we propose Vector-based Feature Adaptation (VeFA), a new fine-tuning method that operates directly in the feature space, which naturally avoids generating intruder dimensions. VeFA performs element-wise adaptation on individual features, thereby ensuring that the effective fine-tuned weights always remain within the column space of the pre-trained weight matrix. This feature-space adaptation perspective is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of downstream lurking variables that induce distribution shifts, which posits that the influence of unobserved factors can be represented as an equivalent aggregate effect on observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, VeFA preserves the pre-trained representations and improves model generalization under distribution shift. We evaluate VeFA against LoRA on image classification, NLU, and NLG benchmarks, considering both standard fine-tuning performance and robustness; across these tasks, VeFA achieves comparable fine-tuning performance while consistently exhibiting stronger robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches either fail to leverage unlabeled data from the target domain or rely on image-to-image translation, which can distort tissue structures and compromise model accuracy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that utilizes a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to generate morphology-preserving and target-aware synthetic images. By conditioning the diffusion model on foundation model features, cohort identity, and tissue preparation method, we preserve tissue structure in the source domain while introducing target-domain appearance characteristics. The target-aware synthetic images, combined with real, labeled images from the source cohort, are subsequently used to train a downstream classifier, which is then tested on the target cohort. The effectiveness of the proposed SSDA framework is demonstrated on the task of lung adenocarcinoma prognostication. The proposed augmentation yielded substantially better performance on the held-out test set from the target cohort, without degrading source-cohort performance. The approach improved the weighted F1 score on the target-cohort held-out test set from 0.611 to 0.706 and the macro F1 score from 0.641 to 0.716. Our results demonstrate that target-aware diffusion-based synthetic data augmentation provides a promising and effective approach for improving domain generalization in computational pathology.</p></details> |  | None |

Through an analysis of numerical uncertainty of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we observe that many operations are applied to values dominated by numerical noise and have negligible influence on model outputs. In some models, up to two-thirds of convolution operations appear redundant. We introduce Conservative & Aggressive NaNs, two novel variants of max pooling and unpooling that identify numerically unstable voxels and replace them with NaNs, allowing subsequent layers to skip computations on irrelevant data. Both methods are implemented within PyTorch and require no architectural changes. We evaluate these approaches on four CNN models spanning neuroimaging and image classification tasks. For inputs containing at least 50% NaNs, we observe consistent runtime improvements; for data with more than two-thirds NaNs )common in several neuroimaging settings) we achieve an average inference speedup of 1.67x. Conservative NaNs reduces convolution operations by an average of 30% across models and datasets, with no measurable performance degradation, and can skip up to 64.64% of convolutions in specific layers. Aggressive NaNs can skip up to 69.30% of convolutions but may occasionally affect performance. Overall, these methods demonstrate that numerical uncertainty can be exploited to reduce redundant computation and improve inference efficiency in CNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper therefore presents CSSMamba (Clustering-guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba) framework to better address the challenges, with the following contributions. First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework. Third, to further improve feature learning capability, we introduce an Attention-Driven Token Selection mechanism to optimize Mamba token sequencing. Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner. Experiments on the Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Liao-Ning 01 datasets demonstrate that CSSMamba achieves higher accuracy and better boundary preservation compared to state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection Based on Total Variation Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15867v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to securing machine learning model deployments against potential distribution shifts in practical applications, the Total Variation Out-of-Distribution (TV-OOD) detection method. Existing methods have produced satisfactory results, but TV-OOD improves upon these by leveraging the Total Variation Network Estimator to calculate each input's contribution to the overall total variation. By defining this as the total variation score, TV-OOD discriminates between in- and out-of-distribution data. The method's efficacy was tested across a range of models and datasets, consistently yielding results in image classification tasks that were either comparable or superior to those achieved by leading-edge out-of-distribution detection techniques across all evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16240v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The practical utility of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems is undermined by their fragility to domain shifts, such as speaker variability, the distinction between acted and naturalistic emotions, and cross-corpus variations. While domain adaptation and fine-tuning are widely studied, they require either source data or labelled target data, which are often unavailable or raise privacy concerns in SER. Test-time adaptation (TTA) bridges this gap by adapting models at inference using only unlabeled target data. Yet, having been predominantly designed for image classification and speech recognition, the efficacy of TTA for mitigating the unique domain shifts in SER has not been investigated. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation and comparison covering 11 TTA methods across three representative SER tasks. The results indicate that backpropagation-free TTA methods are the most promising. Conversely, entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling generally fail, as their core assumption of a single, confident ground-truth label is incompatible with the inherent ambiguity of emotional expression. Further, no single method universally excels, and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the distributional shifts and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> | None |

While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[Benchmarking the Influence of Pre-training on Explanation Performance in MR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12150v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are frequently and successfully used in medical prediction tasks. They are often used in combination with transfer learning, leading to improved performance when training data for the task are scarce. The resulting models are highly complex and typically do not provide any insight into their predictive mechanisms, motivating the field of "explainable" artificial intelligence (XAI). However, previous studies have rarely quantitatively evaluated the "explanation performance" of XAI methods against ground-truth data, and transfer learning and its influence on objective measures of explanation performance has not been investigated. Here, we propose a benchmark dataset that allows for quantifying explanation performance in a realistic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification task. We employ this benchmark to understand the influence of transfer learning on the quality of explanations. Experimental results show that popular XAI methods applied to the same underlying model differ vastly in performance, even when considering only correctly classified examples. We further observe that explanation performance strongly depends on the task used for pre-training and the number of CNN layers pre-trained. These results hold after correcting for a substantial correlation between explanation and classification performance.</p></details> | Under review | None |

In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures.

This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 201,005 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks. We make our dataset, automated processing framework and fine-tuned model weights publicly available on our project's GitHub repository: https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/GAIA.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/GAIA) |

At a structural level, we incorporate architectural constraints derived from a single cortical column of the mouse Primary Visual Cortex(V1): connectivity imposed via adjacency masks, laminar organization, and graded inhibition representing inhibitory neurons. At the functional level, we implement biologically inspired learning: Hebbian synaptic plasticity with homeostatic regulation, Layer Normalization, data augmentation to model exposure to natural variability in sensory input, and synaptic noise to model neural stochasticity. We also include convolutional layers for spatial processing, mimicking retinotopic mapping. The model performance is evaluated on the Facial Emotion Recognition task FER-2013 and compared with a conventional baseline. Additionally, we investigate the impacts of each biological feature through a series of ablation experiments. While connectivity was limited to a single cortical column and biologically relevant connections, BioNIC achieved performance comparable to that of conventional models, with an accuracy of 59.77 $\pm$ 0.27% on FER-2013. Our findings demonstrate that integrating constraints derived from connectomics is a computationally plausible approach to developing biologically inspired artificial intelligence systems.

We propose a generalization of image translation networks for image classification and demonstrate their potential as a more interpretable alternative to conventional black-box classifiers. Approach: We train an image2image network to translate an input image to class-specific hypotheticals, and then compare these with the input, both visually and quantitatively. Translation distances, i.e., the degree of alteration needed to conform to one class or another, are examined for clusters and trends, and used as simple low-dimensional feature vectors for classification. Results: On melanoma/benign dermoscopy images, a translation distance classifier achieved 80% accuracy using only a 2-dimensional feature space (versus 85% for a conventional CNN using a ~62,000-dimensional feature space). Visual inspection of rendered images revealed dataset biases, such as scalebars, vignetting, and pale background pigmentation in melanomas. Image distributions in translation distance space revealed a natural separation along the lines of dermatologist decision to biopsy, rather than between malignant and benign. On bone marrow cytology images, translation distance classifiers outperformed a conventional CNN in both 3-class (92% accuracy vs 89% for CNN) and 6-class (90% vs 86% for CNN) scenarios. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept shows the potential for image2image networks to go beyond artistic/stylistic changes and to expose dataset biases, perform dimension reduction and dataset visualization, and in some cases, potentially outperform conventional end-to-end CNN classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 20 figures, submitted revision to SPIE J.

We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery. We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters.

| **[Feature-Aware Test Generation for Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14081v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep learning models are widely used in software systems, test generation plays a crucial role in assessing the quality of such models before deployment. To date, the most advanced test generators rely on generative AI to synthesize inputs; however, these approaches remain limited in providing semantic insight into the causes of misbehaviours and in offering fine-grained semantic controllability over the generated inputs. In this paper, we introduce Detect, a feature-aware test generation framework for vision-based deep learning (DL) models that systematically generates inputs by perturbing disentangled semantic attributes within the latent space. Detect perturbs individual latent features in a controlled way and observes how these changes affect the model's output. Through this process, it identifies which features lead to behavior shifts and uses a vision-language model for semantic attribution. By distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant features, Detect applies feature-aware perturbations targeted for both generalization and robustness. Empirical results across image classification and detection tasks show that Detect generates high-quality test cases with fine-grained control, reveals distinct shortcut behaviors across model architectures (convolutional and transformer-based), and bugs that are not captured by accuracy metrics. Specifically, Detect outperforms a state-of-the-art test generator in decision boundary discovery and a leading spurious feature localization method in identifying robustness failures. Our findings show that fully fine-tuned convolutional models are prone to overfitting on localized cues, such as co-occurring visual traits, while weakly supervised transformers tend to rely on global features, such as environmental variances. These findings highlight the value of interpretable and feature-aware testing in improving DL model reliability.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, their learned representations remain opaque, making interpreting their decision-making hard. Recent works decompose these representations into human-interpretable concepts, but provide poor spatial grounding and are limited to image classification tasks. In this work, we propose Insight, a language-aligned concept foundation model that provides fine-grained concepts, which are human-interpretable and spatially grounded in the input image. We leverage a hierarchical sparse autoencoder and a foundation model with strong semantic representations to automatically extract concepts at various granularities. Examining local co-occurrence dependencies of concepts allows us to define concept relationships. Through these relations we further improve concept naming and obtain richer explanations. On benchmark data, we show that Insight provides performance on classification and segmentation that is competitive with opaque foundation models while providing fine-grained, high quality concept-based explanations.

Despite their strong performance, LVLMs still struggle with vision-centric tasks such as image classification, underperforming compared to their base vision encoders, which are often CLIP-based models. To address this limitation, we propose Context-Aware Image Representation Prioritization via Ensemble (CARPE), a novel, model-agnostic framework which introduces vision-integration layers and a context-aware ensemble strategy to identify when to prioritize image representations or rely on the reasoning capabilities of the language model. This design enhances the model's ability to adaptively weight visual and textual modalities and enables the model to capture various aspects of image representations, leading to consistent improvements in generalization across classification and vision-language benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARPE not only improves performance on image classification benchmarks but also enhances results across various vision-language benchmarks. Finally, CARPE is designed to be effectively integrated with most open-source LVLMs that consist of a vision encoder and a language model, ensuring its adaptability across diverse architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

Under non-IID data, these uniformly weighted updates can be strongly misaligned across clients, causing client drift and degrading the global model. Here we propose Fisher-Informed Parameterwise Aggregation (FIPA), a second-order aggregation method that replaces client-level scalar weights with parameter-specific Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) weights, enabling true parameter-level scaling that captures how each client's data uniquely influences different parameters. With low-rank approximation, FIPA remains communication- and computation-efficient. Across nonlinear function regression, PDE learning, and image classification, FIPA consistently improves over averaging-based aggregation, and can be effectively combined with state-of-the-art client-side optimization algorithms to further improve image classification accuracy. These results highlight the benefits of FIPA for federated learning under heterogeneous data distributions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the high computational and energy overhead of on-device training hinders its deployment on battery-powered mobile systems with strict thermal and memory budgets. While prior research has extensively optimized model architectures for efficient inference, the training phase remains bottlenecked by the processing of massive, often redundant, local datasets. In this work, we propose a data-centric optimization framework that leverages dataset pruning to achieve resource-efficient edge learning. Unlike standard methods that process all available data, our approach constructs compact, highly informative training subsets via a lightweight, on-device importance evaluation. Specifically, we utilize average loss statistics derived from a truncated warm-up phase to rank sample importance, deterministically retaining only the most critical data points under a dynamic pruning ratio. This mechanism is model-agnostic and operates locally without inter-device communication. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves a near-linear reduction in training latency and energy consumption proportional to the pruning ratio, with negligible degradation in model accuracy. These results validate dataset pruning as a vital, complementary paradigm for enhancing the sustainability and scalability of learning on resource-constrained mobile edge devices.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures | None |

We show that a frozen diffusion backbone enables strong fine-grained recognition by probing intermediate denoising features across layers and timesteps and training a linear classifier for each pair. We evaluate this in a real-world plankton-monitoring setting with practical impact, using controlled and comparable training setups against established supervised and self-supervised baselines. Frozen diffusion features are competitive with supervised baselines and outperform other self-supervised methods in both balanced and naturally long-tailed settings.

We prove that the expected prediction deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient features, such as image backgrounds.

However, this paradigm encounters critical challenges when applied to vision-language models (VLM) (e.g., CLIP): constructing adversarially robust teacher for large-scale multi-modal models demands prohibitively high computational resources. We bridge this gap by revealing an interesting phenomenon: vanilla CLIP (without adversarial training) exhibits intrinsic defensive capabilities against adversarial examples generated by another CLIP with different architectures. We formally define this as proxy adversarial robustness, and naturally propose a Heterogeneous Proxy Transfer (HPT) framework that establishes cross-architectural robustness distillation channels between CLIP variants, effortlessly enabling the VLM robustness transfer from proxy to target models. Yet, such proxy transfer paradigm easily induces severe overfitting, leading to a sharp degradation in zero-shot natural generalization. To resolve that, we design Generalization-Pivot Decoupling (GPD) by leveraging the difference in learning rate scheduling. This decouples the proxy transfer process into a generalization-anchored warm-up that maintains generalization and a generalization-pulled HPT that promotes adversarial robustness, to achieve an equilibrium between natural generalization and adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on 15 zero-shot datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HPT-GPD method. The code is available at the website of github.com/fxw13/HPT-GPD.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](http://github.com/fxw13/HPT-GPD) |

Despite their popularity, the faithfulness and reliability of these heatmap-based explanations remain under scrutiny. This study critically investigates whether Grad-CAM truly represents the internal decision-making of deep models trained for lung cancer image classification. Using the publicly available IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, we evaluate five representative architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-161, EfficientNet-B0, and ViT-Base-Patch16-224, to explore model-dependent variations in Grad-CAM interpretability. We introduce a quantitative evaluation framework that combines localization accuracy, perturbation-based faithfulness, and explanation consistency to assess Grad-CAM reliability across architectures. Experimental findings reveal that while Grad-CAM effectively highlights salient tumor regions in most convolutional networks, its interpretive fidelity significantly degrades for Vision Transformer models due to non-local attention behavior. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons indicate substantial variability in saliency localization, implying that Grad-CAM explanations may not always correspond to the true diagnostic evidence used by the networks. This work exposes critical limitations of current saliency-based XAI approaches in medical imaging and emphasizes the need for model-aware interpretability methods that are both computationally sound and clinically meaningful. Our findings aim to inspire a more cautious and rigorous adoption of visual explanation tools in medical AI, urging the community to rethink what it truly means to "trust" a model's explanation.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

To address these issues, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Scale Correlation Meta-Network (AMC-MetaNet), a lightweight yet powerful framework with three key innovations: (i) correlation-guided feature pyramids for capturing scale-invariant patterns, (ii) an adaptive channel correlation module (ACCM) for learning dynamic cross-scale relationships, and (iii) correlation-guided meta-learning that leverages correlation patterns instead of conventional prototype averaging. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heavy pre-trained models or transformers, AMC-MetaNet is trained from scratch with only $\sim600K$ parameters, offering $20\times$ fewer parameters than ResNet-18 while maintaining high efficiency ($<50$ms per image inference). AMC-MetaNet achieves up to 86.65\% accuracy in 5-way 5-shot classification on various remote sensing datasets, including EuroSAT, NWPU-RESISC45, UC Merced Land Use, and AID.

Concept-based interpretations aim to address this by explaining model reasoning through human-understandable concepts. However, existing post-hoc methods and ante-hoc concept bottleneck models (CBMs), suffer from limitations such as unreliable concept relevance, non-visual or labor-intensive concept definitions, and model or data-agnostic assumptions. This paper introduces Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Model via Representation Decomposition (PCBM-ReD), a novel pipeline that retrofits interpretability onto pretrained opaque models. PCBM-ReD automatically extracts visual concepts from a pre-trained encoder, employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to label and filter concepts based on visual identifiability and task relevance, and selects an independent subset via reconstruction-guided optimization. Leveraging CLIP's visual-text alignment, it decomposes image representations into linear combination of concept embeddings to fit into the CBMs abstraction.

| **[Gradient Structure Estimation under Label-Only Oracles via Spectral Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14300v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, pose a fundamentally constrained yet practically important feedback model for understanding model behavior. A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\%$ detection rate. Our code will be released publicly soon at https://github.com/csjunjun/DPAttack.git.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/csjunjun/DPAttack.git) |

Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative by mimicking biological efficiency through event-driven processing. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cycle-accurate, hardware-oriented Spiking Neural Network (SNN) core implemented in SystemVerilog. Unlike conventional accelerators, this design utilizes a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model powered by fixed-point arithmetic and bit-wise primitives (shifts and additions) to eliminate the need for complex floating-point hardware. The architecture features an on-chip Poisson encoder for stochastic spike generation and a novel active pruning mechanism that dynamically disables neurons post-classification to minimize dynamic power consumption. We demonstrate the hardware's efficacy through a fully connected layer implementation targeting digit classification. Simulation results indicate that the design achieves rapid convergence (89% accuracy) within limited timesteps while maintaining a significantly reduced computational footprint compared to traditional dense architectures. This work serves as a foundational building block for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware on FPGA and ASIC platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables.

| **[A Confidence-Variance Theory for Pseudo-Label Selection in Semi-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11670v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most pseudo-label selection strategies in semi-supervised learning rely on fixed confidence thresholds, implicitly assuming that prediction confidence reliably indicates correctness. In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

Transfer learning addresses this challenge by utilizing pre-trained models to tackle new tasks with limited labeled data. However, discrepancies between source and target domains can hinder effective transfer learning. We introduce BioTune, a novel adaptive fine-tuning technique utilizing evolutionary optimization. BioTune enhances transfer learning by optimally choosing which layers to freeze and adjusting learning rates for unfrozen layers. Through extensive evaluation on nine image classification datasets, spanning natural and specialized domains such as medical imaging, BioTune demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, including AutoRGN and LoRA, highlighting its adaptability to various data characteristics and distribution changes. Additionally, BioTune consistently achieves top performance across four different CNN architectures, underscoring its flexibility. Ablation studies provide valuable insights into the impact of BioTune's key components on overall performance.

We present a systematic evaluation of this question by incorporating frozen representations of various language models into a discriminative vision-language framework and measuring zero-shot generalization to novel concepts. We find that decoder-based models exhibit stronger visual alignment than encoders, even when controlling for model and dataset size. Moreover, language modeling performance correlates with visual generalization, suggesting that advances in unimodal LLMs can simultaneously improve vision models. Leveraging these insights, we propose ShareLock, a lightweight method for fusing frozen vision and language backbones. ShareLock achieves robust performance across tasks while drastically reducing the need for paired data and compute. With just 563k image-caption pairs and under one GPU-hour of training, it reaches 51% accuracy on ImageNet. In cross-lingual settings, ShareLock dramatically outperforms CLIP, achieving 38.7% top-1 accuracy on Chinese image classification versus CLIP's 1.4%. Code is available.</p></details> |  | None |

Captured with a prototype industrial sorting machine, ICONIC-444 closely mimics real-world tasks. It complements existing datasets by offering structured, diverse data suited for rigorous OOD evaluation across a spectrum of task complexities.

Data augmentation -- particularly mask-based information dropping -- can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and risk discarding essential semantics. We propose Granular Ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular Ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements not only in image classification and masked image reconstruction, but also in image tampering detection, validating the effectiveness and generalization of GBGM across both recognition and forensic scenarios. Simple and model-agnostic, GBGM integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers, offering a practical paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we study how individual attention heads in text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes. Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation, as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning. Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> | None |
| **[Attention Consistency Regularization for Interpretable Early-Exit Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08891v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 2 pages, 1 figure | None |
| **[WaveFormer: Frequency-Time Decoupled Vision Modeling with Wave Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08602v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

We introduce a supervised extension of Spike Agreement-Dependent Plasticity (SADP), which replaces pairwise spike-timing comparisons with population-level agreement metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The proposed learning rule preserves strict synaptic locality, admits linear-time complexity, and enables efficient supervised learning without backpropagation, surrogate gradients, or teacher forcing. We integrate supervised SADP within hybrid CNN-SNN architectures, where convolutional encoders provide compact feature representations that are converted into Poisson spike trains for agreement-driven learning in the SNN. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and biomedical image classification tasks demonstrate competitive performance and fast convergence. Additional analyses show stable performance across broad hyperparameter ranges and compatibility with device-inspired synaptic update dynamics. Together, these results establish supervised SADP as a scalable, biologically grounded, and hardware-aligned learning paradigm for spiking neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-language models (VLMs) enable strong zero-shot image classification, but existing VLM-based distracted driver detectors often underperform in real-world conditions. We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Noise-Adaptive Regularization for Robust Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08446v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of reliable methods for multi-label classification (MLC) has become a prominent research direction in remote sensing (RS). As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC.</p></details> | Submitted to TGRS | None |

AIMC seeks to identify the modulation type embedded within a single radar pulse from its complex in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representation, enabling automated interpretation of intrapulse structure. This paper introduces AIMC-Spec, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for spectrogram-based image classification, encompassing 33 modulation types across 13 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To benchmark AIMC-Spec, five representative deep learning algorithms - ranging from lightweight CNNs and denoising architectures to transformer-based networks - were re-implemented and evaluated under a unified input format. The results reveal significant performance variation, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, particularly at low SNRs. A focused FM-only test further highlights how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness. AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides a foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE Access DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3645091</p></details> | None |

Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features. As such, GPM conforms to two characteristic behaviors of human vision perceiving the whole before focusing on details, and maintaining broad contextual awareness even during local attention. Built upon GPM, we further develop the lightweight H-GPE network. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation show that H-GPE achieves strong performance while maintaining a balanced footprint in both FLOPs and parameters, delivering a more favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared with recent state-of-the-art lightweight models.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures | None |

In order to separate these similar information and their respective advantages, reduce the feature redundancy in the fusion stage. This paper introduces a diff-attention aware state space fusion model (DAS2F-Model) for multimodal remote sensing image classification. Based on the selective state space model, a cross-modal diff-attention module (CMDA-Module) is designed to extract and separate the common features and their respective dominant features of MS and PAN images. Among this, space preserving visual mamba (SPVM) retains image spatial features and captures local features by optimizing visual mamba's input reasonably. Considering that features in the fusion stage will have large semantic differences after feature separation and simple fusion operations struggle to effectively integrate these significantly different features, an attention-aware linear fusion module (AALF-Module) is proposed. It performs pixel-wise linear fusion by calculating influence coefficients. This mechanism can fuse features with large semantic differences while keeping the feature size unchanged.

Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data.

While high-quality data is often preferred for training, real-world inputs are frequently affected by noise and other distortions. This paper investigates the effect of deliberately introducing controlled noise into the training data to improve model robustness. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the impact of three common corruptions, namely Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, and Gaussian blur at varying intensities and training set pollution levels. Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance. These findings suggest that strategic exposure to noise can act as a simple yet effective regularizer, offering a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pagers, 10 figures, 2 tables, SPIE Applications of Machine Learning 2025, San Diego, August, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[EMP: Enhance Memory in Data Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16031v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language and vision models have shown strong performance, but due to high pre-training and fine-tuning costs, research has shifted towards faster training via dataset pruning. Previous methods used sample loss as an evaluation criterion, aiming to select the most "difficult" samples for training. However, when the pruning rate increases, the number of times each sample is trained becomes more evenly distributed, which causes many critical or general samples to not be effectively fitted. We refer to this as Low-Frequency Learning (LFL). In other words, LFL prevents the model from remembering most samples. In our work, we decompose the scoring function of LFL, provide a theoretical explanation for the inefficiency of LFL, and propose adding a memory term to the scoring function to enhance the model's memory capability, along with an approximation of this memory term. Similarly, we explore memory in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), marking the first discussion on SSL memory. Using contrastive learning, we derive the memory term both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we propose Enhance Memory Pruning (EMP), which addresses the issue of insufficient memory under high pruning rates by enhancing the model's memory of data, thereby improving its performance. We evaluated the performance of EMP in tasks such as image classification, natural language understanding, and model pre-training. The results show that EMP can improve model performance under extreme pruning rates. For example, in the CIFAR100-ResNet50 pre-training task, with 70\% pruning, EMP outperforms current methods by 2.2\%.</p></details> |  | None |

In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper contains 10 pages, 8 figures and 8 tables.

Our method incorporates a masked image reconstruction task, where parts of the input are occluded and reconstructed to encourage semantically rich feature learning. This auxiliary task strengthens spatial understanding and improves class discrimination under low-data settings. We evaluated the efficacy of EuroSAT and PatternNet datasets under 1-shot and 5-shot protocols, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines.

While this efficiency makes MoE attractive for vision tasks, the patch-based processing in vision models introduces new methods for adversaries to perform backdoor attacks. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of vision MoE models for image classification, specifically the patch-based MoE (pMoE) models and MoE-based vision transformers, against backdoor attacks. We propose a novel routing-aware trigger application method BadPatches, which is designed for patch-based processing in vision MoE models. BadPatches applies triggers on image patches rather than on the entire image. We show that BadPatches achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) with lower poisoning rates than routing-agnostic triggers and is successful at poisoning rates as low as 0.01% with an ASR above 80% on pMoE. Moreover, BadPatches is still effective when an adversary does not have complete knowledge of the patch routing configuration of the considered models. Next, we explore how trigger design affects pMoE patch routing. Finally, we investigate fine-pruning as a defense. Results show that only the fine-tuning stage of fine-pruning removes the backdoor from the model.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here, we introduce \textit{Regional Expert Networks (REN)}, the first anatomically-informed MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL) features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of 0.8646 +- 0.0467, a +12.5\% improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC 0.7685, p=0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79) and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

Federated learning (FL) allows hospitals to collaboratively train models without sharing raw images, but current FL algorithms typically assume a static data distribution. In practice, hospitals experience continual evolution in case mix, annotation protocols, and imaging devices, which leads to catastrophic forgetting when models are updated sequentially. Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to reconcile these challenges but existing methods either ignore the stringent privacy constraints of healthcare or rely on replay buffers and public surrogate datasets that are difficult to justify in clinical settings. We study FCL for chest radiography classification in a setting where hospitals are clients that receive temporally evolving streams of cases and labels. We introduce DP-FedEPC (Differentially Private Federated Elastic Prototype Consolidation), a method that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC), prototype-based rehearsal, and client-side differential privacy within a standard FedAvg framework. EWC constrains updates along parameters deemed important for previous tasks, while a memory of latent prototypes preserves class structure without storing raw images. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) at each client adds calibrated Gaussian noise to clipped gradients, providing formal privacy guarantees for individual radiographs.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed NFP layer captures relationships between neighboring spatial features by aggregating local similarity patterns across feature dimensions. Implemented using standard convolutional operations, NFP can be seamlessly integrated into existing neural network architectures with minimal additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and backbone models demonstrate that NFP consistently improves classification performance compared to conventional pooling strategies, while maintaining computational efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of neighborhood-based feature aggregation for capturing discriminative texture information in remote sensing imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, accepted at the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026, 3rd Workshop on Computer Vision for Earth Observation (CV4EO)</p></details> | None |
| **[Practical Continual Forgetting for Pre-trained Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09705v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For privacy and security concerns, the need to erase unwanted information from pre-trained vision models is becoming evident nowadays. In real-world scenarios, erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model owners, and these requests usually form a sequence. Therefore, under such a setting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a pre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as continual forgetting and identify three key challenges. (i) For unwanted knowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining knowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal. (iii) In real-world scenarios, the training samples may be scarce or partially missing during the process of forgetting. To address them, we first propose Group Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we introduce Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to fine-tune the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting task independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is adopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out the others. To further extend GS-LoRA to more practical scenarios, we incorporate prototype information as additional supervision and introduce a more practical approach, GS-LoRA++. For each forgotten class, we move the logits away from its original prototype. For the remaining classes, we pull the logits closer to their respective prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments on face recognition, object detection, and image classification and demonstrate that our method manages to forget specific classes with minimal impact on other classes.

However, their convergence often suffers from non-vanishing variance. Variance Reduction (VR) methods, such as SVRG and SARAH, address this issue but introduce a bottleneck by requiring periodic full gradient computations. In this paper, we explore popular VR techniques and propose an approach that eliminates the necessity for expensive full gradient calculations. To avoid these computations and make our approach memory-efficient, we employ two key techniques: the shuffling heuristic and the concept of SAG/SAGA methods. For non-convex objectives, our convergence rates match those of standard shuffling methods, while under strong convexity, they demonstrate an improvement. We empirically validate the efficiency of our approach and demonstrate its scalability on large-scale machine learning tasks including image classification problem on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive aggregation of Monte Carlo augmented decomposed filters for efficient group-equivariant convolutional neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10110v4)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNN) heavily rely on parameter sharing to increase CNN's data efficiency and performance. However, the parameter-sharing strategy greatly increases the computational burden for each added parameter, which hampers its application to deep neural network models. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a non-parameter-sharing approach for group equivariant neural networks. The proposed methods adaptively aggregate a diverse range of filters by a weighted sum of stochastically augmented decomposed filters. We give theoretical proof about how the group equivariance can be achieved by our methods. Our method applies to both continuous and discrete groups, where the augmentation is implemented using Monte Carlo sampling and bootstrap resampling, respectively. Our methods also serve as an efficient extension of standard CNN. The experiments show that our method outperforms parameter-sharing group equivariant networks and enhances the performance of standard CNNs in image classification and denoising tasks, by using suitable filter bases to build efficient lightweight networks.

| **[Leveraging Membership Inference Attacks for Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning for Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06200v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while keeping training data localized, allowing us to preserve privacy in various domains including remote sensing. However, recent studies show that FL models may still leak sensitive information through their outputs, motivating the need for rigorous privacy evaluation. In this paper, we leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework for FL applied to remote sensing image classification. We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance. These findings confirm MIA as a practical metric and highlight the importance of integrating privacy measurement into FL system design for remote sensing applications.</p></details> | 5 pages | None |
| **[seq-JEPA: Autoregressive Predictive Learning of Invariant-Equivariant World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03176v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint-embedding self-supervised learning (SSL) commonly relies on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations, a task achieved by enforcing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations applied to two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm in SSL often limits the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between high-level invariance-demanding tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we propose \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling framework that introduces architectural inductive biases into joint-embedding predictive architectures to resolve this trade-off. Without relying on dual equivariance predictors or loss terms, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally separate representations for equivariance- and invariance-demanding tasks. To do so, our model processes short sequences of different views (observations) of inputs. Each encoded view is concatenated with an embedding of the relative transformation (action) that produces the next observation in the sequence. These view-action pairs are passed through a transformer encoder that outputs an aggregate representation. A predictor head then conditions this aggregate representation on the upcoming action to predict the representation of the next observation. Empirically, seq-JEPA demonstrates strong performance on both equivariance- and invariance-demanding downstream tasks without sacrificing one for the other. Furthermore, it excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.</p></details> |  | None |

While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency. The results show that EdgeLDR layers provide significant compression with competitive accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing architectures still trade accuracy for latency, which limits their applicability on microcontroller and neural processing unit based devices. In this work, we introduce two new model families, STResNet for image classification and STYOLO for object detection, jointly optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint on resource constrained platforms. The proposed STResNet series, ranging from Nano to Tiny variants, achieves competitive ImageNet 1K accuracy within a four million parameter budget. Specifically, STResNetMilli attains 70.0 percent Top 1 accuracy with only three million parameters, outperforming MobileNetV1 and ShuffleNetV2 at comparable computational complexity. For object detection, STYOLOMicro and STYOLOMilli achieve 30.5 percent and 33.6 percent mean average precision, respectively, on the MS COCO dataset, surpassing YOLOv5n and YOLOX Nano in both accuracy and efficiency.

We propose sequential noise scheduling, which distributes the noise budget across orthogonal subspaces of the parameter space, rather than injecting it all at once. This simple modification mitigates the destructive effect of noise while preserving the original certification guarantees. We extend the analysis of noisy fine-tuning to the subspace setting, proving that the same $(\varepsilon,δ)$ privacy budget is retained. Empirical results on image classification benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves accuracy after unlearning while remaining robust to membership inference attacks. These results show that certified unlearning can achieve both rigorous guarantees and practical utility.</p></details> |  | None |

In real-world scenarios, fully unlabeled datasets are rare, making semi-supervised learning (SSL) highly relevant in scenarios where a small amount of labeled data coexists with a large volume of unlabeled data. A well-known semi-supervised contrastive learning approach involves assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. This study aims to enhance pseudo-label-based SSL by incorporating distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings to improve image classification accuracy across multiple datasets.</p></details> | ITC-CSCC accepted | None |

In this work, we present a comparative analysis of a custom-designed CNN and several widely used deep learning architectures, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet, for an image classification task. The custom CNN is developed and trained from scratch, while the popular architectures are employed using transfer learning under identical experimental settings. All models are evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results show that pre-trained CNN architectures consistently outperform the custom CNN in terms of classification accuracy and convergence speed, particularly when training data is limited. However, the custom CNN demonstrates competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity. This study highlights the trade-offs between model complexity, performance, and computational efficiency, and provides practical insights into selecting appropriate CNN architectures for image classification problems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods only loosely reflect the model's prediction-making process, thereby merely white-painting the black box. We argue that explanatory alignment is a key aspect of trustworthiness in prediction tasks: explanations must be directly linked to predictions, rather than serving as post-hoc rationalizations. We present model readability as a design principle enabling alignment, and PiNets as a modeling framework to pursue it in a deep learning context. PiNets are pseudo-linear networks that produce instance-wise linear predictions in an arbitrary feature space, making them linearly readable. We illustrate their use on image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating how PiNets produce explanations that are faithful across multiple criteria in addition to alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

Our experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning with fine-tuning consistently outperforms both custom CNNs built from scratch and feature extraction methods, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 3% to 76% across different datasets. Notably, ResNet-18 with fine-tuning achieved perfect 100% accuracy on the Road Damage BD dataset. While custom CNNs offer advantages in model size (3.4M parameters vs. 11-134M for pre-trained models) and training efficiency on simpler tasks, pre-trained models with transfer learning provide superior performance, particularly on complex classification tasks with limited training data.

While FL preserves data privacy by eliminating centralized storage, it encounters significant challenges such as performance degradation, slower convergence, and reduced robustness of the global model due to the heterogeneity in client data distributions. Among the various forms of data heterogeneity, label skew emerges as a particularly formidable and prevalent issue, especially in domains such as image classification. To address these challenges, we begin with comprehensive experiments to pinpoint the underlying issues in the FL training process. Based on our findings, we then introduce an innovative dual-strategy approach designed to effectively resolve these issues. First, we introduce an adaptive loss function for client-side training, meticulously crafted to preserve previously acquired knowledge while maintaining an optimal equilibrium between local optimization and global model coherence. Secondly, we develop a dynamic aggregation strategy for aggregating client models at the server. This approach adapts to each client's unique learning patterns, effectively addressing the challenges of diverse data across the network. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across three diverse real-world datasets, coupled with theoretical convergence guarantees, demonstrates the superior efficacy of our method compared to several established state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> | None |

However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in IEEE 2024.

Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures.

However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. This work pioneers defense strategies against multimodal attacks, providing insights for building robust VLMs from both optimization and data perspectives.

In practice, practitioners often choose among (i) training a compact custom CNN from scratch, (ii) using a large pre-trained CNN as a fixed feature extractor, and (iii) performing transfer learning via partial or full fine-tuning of a pre-trained backbone. This report presents a controlled comparison of these three paradigms across five real-world image classification datasets spanning road-surface defect recognition, agricultural variety identification, fruit/leaf disease recognition, pedestrian walkway encroachment recognition, and unauthorized vehicle recognition. Models are evaluated using accuracy and macro F1-score, complemented by efficiency metrics including training time per epoch and parameter counts. The results show that transfer learning consistently yields the strongest predictive performance, while the custom CNN provides an attractive efficiency--accuracy trade-off, especially when compute and memory budgets are constrained.</p></details> |  | None |

To ensure the security of communication systems, encryption techniques are employed to safeguard confidentiality and integrity. However, existing encryption schemes encounter obstacles when applied to SemCom. To address this issue, this paper explores the feasibility of applying homomorphic encryption (HE) to SemCom. Initially, we review the encryption algorithms utilized in mobile communication systems and analyze the challenges associated with their application to SemCom. Subsequently, we overview HE techniques and employ scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to demonstrate that the extractable semantic information can be preserved in homomorphic encrypted ciphertext. Based on this finding, we further propose the HE-joint source-channel coding (HE-JSCC) scheme, where the traditional JSCC model architecture is modified to support HE operations. Moreover, we present the simulation results for image classification and image generation tasks. Furthermore, we provide potential future research directions for homomorphic encrypted SemCom.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

| **[Communication-Efficient Federated AUC Maximization with Cyclic Client Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01649v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated AUC maximization is a powerful approach for learning from imbalanced data in federated learning (FL). However, existing methods typically assume full client availability, which is rarely practical. In real-world FL systems, clients often participate in a cyclic manner: joining training according to a fixed, repeating schedule. This setting poses unique optimization challenges for the non-decomposable AUC objective. This paper addresses these challenges by developing and analyzing communication-efficient algorithms for federated AUC maximization under cyclic client participation. We investigate two key settings: First, we study AUC maximization with a squared surrogate loss, which reformulates the problem as a nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. By leveraging the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we establish a state-of-the-art communication complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/ε^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/ε)$. Second, we consider general pairwise AUC losses. We establish a communication complexity of $O(1/ε^3)$ and an iteration complexity of $O(1/ε^4)$. Further, under the PL condition, these bounds improve to communication complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/ε^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/ε)$. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks in image classification, medical imaging, and fraud detection demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> | None |

Interestingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the image-by-image correlation between the decoded decisions based on the internal neural representations in a classification task. Thus, it can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate DVC using monkey V4/IT recordings and network models trained on image classification tasks. We find that model-model similarity is comparable to monkey-monkey similarity, whereas model-monkey similarity is consistently lower. Strikingly, DVC decreases with increasing network performance on ImageNet-1k. Adversarial training does not improve model-monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions assessed using DVC, although it markedly increases the model-model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model-monkey similarity. These results suggest a divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version; accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

The datasets span binary classification, fine-grained multiclass recognition, and object detection scenarios. We analyze how architectural factors, such as network depth, residual connections, and feature extraction strategies, influence classification and localization performance. The results show that deeper CNN architectures provide substantial performance gains on fine-grained multiclass datasets, while lightweight pretrained and transfer learning models remain highly effective for simpler binary classification tasks. Additionally, we extend the proposed architecture to an object detection setting, demonstrating its adaptability in identifying unauthorized auto-rickshaws in real-world traffic scenes. Building upon a systematic analysis of custom CNN architectures alongside pretrained and transfer learning models, this study provides practical guidance for selecting suitable network designs based on task complexity and resource constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Networks on Symmetric Spaces of Noncompact Type](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01097v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have demonstrated promising performances of neural networks on hyperbolic spaces and symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds. These spaces belong to a family of Riemannian manifolds referred to as symmetric spaces of noncompact type. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for developing neural networks on such spaces. Our approach relies on a unified formulation of the distance from a point to a hyperplane on the considered spaces. We show that some existing formulations of the point-to-hyperplane distance can be recovered by our approach under specific settings. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the point-to-hyperplane distance in higher-rank symmetric spaces of noncompact type equipped with G-invariant Riemannian metrics. The derived distance then serves as a tool to design fully-connected (FC) layers and an attention mechanism for neural networks on the considered spaces. Our approach is validated on challenging benchmarks for image classification, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification, image generation, and natural language inference.</p></details> |  | None |

This study evaluates the classification performance of machine learning and deep learning models on the LC25000 dataset, which includes five classes of histopathological images. We used the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 network both as a classifier and for feature extraction. Our results show that the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 achieved a classification accuracy of 96.01\% and an average AUC of 96.8\%. Models trained on deep features from InceptionResNet-v2 outperformed those using only the pre-trained network, with the Neural Network model achieving an AUC of 99.99\% and accuracy of 99.84\%. Evaluating model robustness under varying SNR conditions revealed that models using deep features exhibited greater resilience, particularly GBM and KNN. The combination of HOG and deep features showed enhanced performance, however, less so in noisy environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Brain network science modelling of sparse neural networks enables Transformers and LLMs to perform as fully connected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19107v3)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic sparse training (DST) can reduce the computational demands in ANNs, but faces difficulties in keeping peak performance at high sparsity levels. The Cannistraci-Hebb training (CHT) is a brain-inspired method for growing connectivity in DST. CHT leverages a gradient-free, topology-driven link regrowth, which has shown ultra-sparse (less than 1% connectivity) advantage across various tasks compared to fully connected networks. Yet, CHT suffers two main drawbacks: (i) its time complexity is $O(Nd^3)$ - N node network size, d node degree - restricting it to ultra-sparse regimes. (ii) it selects top link prediction scores, which is inappropriate for the early training epochs, when the network presents unreliable connections. Here, we design the first brain-inspired network model - termed bipartite receptive field (BRF) - to initialize the connectivity of sparse artificial neural networks. We further introduce a GPU-friendly matrix-based approximation of CH link prediction, reducing complexity to $O(N^3)$. We introduce the Cannistraci-Hebb training soft rule (CHTs), which adopts a flexible strategy for sampling connections in both link removal and regrowth, balancing the exploration and exploitation of network topology. Additionally, we integrate CHTs with a sigmoid gradual density decay (CHTss). Empirical results show that BRF offers performance advantages over previous network science models. Using 1% of connections, CHTs outperforms fully connected networks in MLP architectures on image classification tasks, compressing some networks to less than 30% of the nodes. Using 5% of the connections, CHTss outperforms fully connected networks in two Transformer-based machine translation tasks. Finally, at 30% connectivity, both CHTs and CHTss outperform other DST methods in language modeling task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they often fall short in other critical quality dimensions, such as robustness, calibration, or fairness. While existing studies have focused on a subset of these quality dimensions, none have explored a more general form of "well-behavedness" of DNNs. With this work, we address this gap by simultaneously studying nine different quality dimensions for image classification. Through a large-scale study, we provide a bird's-eye view by analyzing 326 backbone models and how different training paradigms and model architectures affect these quality dimensions. We reveal various new insights such that (i) vision-language models exhibit high class balance on ImageNet-1k classification and strong robustness against domain changes; (ii) training models initialized with weights obtained through self-supervised learning is an effective strategy to improve most considered quality dimensions; and (iii) the training dataset size is a major driver for most of the quality dimensions. We conclude our study by introducing the QUBA score (Quality Understanding Beyond Accuracy), a novel metric that ranks models across multiple dimensions of quality, enabling tailored recommendations based on specific user needs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning to be Reproducible: Custom Loss Design for Robust Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00578v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the reproducibility and reliability of deep learning models, we address a critical gap in current training methodologies: the lack of mechanisms that ensure consistent and robust performance across runs. Our empirical analysis reveals that even under controlled initialization and training conditions, the accuracy of the model can exhibit significant variability. To address this issue, we propose a Custom Loss Function (CLF) that reduces the sensitivity of training outcomes to stochastic factors such as weight initialization and data shuffling. By fine-tuning its parameters, CLF explicitly balances predictive accuracy with training stability, leading to more consistent and reliable model performance. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures for both image classification and time series forecasting demonstrate that our approach significantly improves training robustness without sacrificing predictive performance. These results establish CLF as an effective and efficient strategy for developing more stable, reliable and trustworthy neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation for Training and Regularisation of Binary Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00449v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have raised concerns about its increasing energy consumption, while demand for deploying AI in mobile devices and machines at the edge is growing. Binary neural networks (BNNs) have recently gained attention as energy and memory efficient models suitable for resource constrained environments; however, training BNNs exactly is computationally challenging because of its discrete characteristics. Recent work proposing a framework for training BNNs based on quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) and progress in the design of Ising machines for solving QUBO problems suggest a potential path to efficiently optimising discrete neural networks. In this work, we extend existing QUBO models for training BNNs to accommodate arbitrary network topologies and propose two novel methods for regularisation. The first method maximises neuron margins biasing the training process toward parameter configurations that yield larger pre-activation magnitudes. The second method employs a dropout-inspired iterative scheme in which reduced subnetworks are trained and used to adjust linear penalties on network parameters. We apply the proposed QUBO formulation to a small binary image classification problem and conduct computational experiments on a GPU-based Ising machine. The numerical results indicate that the proposed regularisation terms modify training behaviour and yield improvements in classification accuracy on data not present in the training set.</p></details> | 32 pages, 12 figures | None |

Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional graph-based classifiers degrade on natural multi-class images because typical graphs fail to preserve separability on feature manifolds with complex topology. We address this with a physics-inspired pipeline frozen MobileNetV2 embeddings are treated as Ising spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph forming a Random Bond Ising Model. The system is tuned to its Nishimori temperature identified where the smallest Bethe-Hessian eigenvalue vanishes. Our method rests on two innovations: we prove a spectral-topological correspondence linking graph trapping sets to invariants via the Ihara-Bass zeta function removing these structures boosts top-1 accuracy over four-fold in multi-class settings; we develop a quadratic-Newton estimator for the Nishimori temperature converging in around 9 Arnoldi iterations for a 6-times speedup enabling spectral embedding on scales like ImageNet-100. The resulting graphs compress 1280-dimensional MobileNetV2 features to 32 dimensions for ImageNet10 and 64 for ImageNet-100 We achieve 98.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 84.92% on ImageNet-100 with a three-graph soft ensemble Versus MobileNetV2 our hard ensemble increases top-1 by 0.1% while cutting FLOPs by 2.67-times compared to ResNet50 the soft ensemble drops top1 by only 1.09% yet reduces FLOPs by 29-times.

This paper introduces Orchid, a novel architecture designed to address the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms without compromising the ability to capture long-range dependencies and in-context learning. At the core of this architecture lies a new data-dependent global convolution layer, which contextually adapts its kernel conditioned on input sequence using a dedicated conditioning neural network. We design two simple conditioning networks that maintain shift equivariance in our data-dependent convolution operation. The dynamic nature of the proposed convolution kernel grants Orchid high expressivity while maintaining quasilinear scalability for long sequences. We evaluate the proposed model across multiple domains, including language modeling and image classification, to highlight its performance and generality. Our experiments demonstrate that this architecture not only outperforms traditional attention-based architectures such as BERT and Vision Transformers with smaller model sizes, but also extends the feasible sequence length beyond the limitations of the dense attention layers. This achievement represents a significant step towards more efficient and scalable deep learning models for sequence modeling.

This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bayesian Self-Distillation for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24162v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 17 figures | None |

By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA creates valid augmented samples from the data distribution with high diversity, properties we theoretically show that are essential for a Test-Time Augmentation method to be effective. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost. Our comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, pneumonia detection, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |

The majority of articles in this literature considers a (plain) feed forward neural network architecture in order to connect the neurons used for learning the function mapping inputs to outputs. In this article, motivated by methods in image classification and recent advances in machine learning methods for PDEs, we investigate empirically whether and how the choice of network architecture affects the accuracy and training time of a machine learning algorithm. We find that the generalized highway network architecture achieves the best performance, when considering the mean squared error and the training time as criteria, within the considered parameter budgets for the Black-Scholes and Heston option pricing problems. Considering the transformed implied volatility problem, a simplified DGM variant achieves the lowest error among the tested architectures.

| **[Dynamical Learning in Deep Asymmetric Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05041v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate recurrent neural networks with asymmetric interactions and demonstrate that the inclusion of self-couplings or sparse excitatory inter-module connections leads to the emergence of a densely connected manifold of dynamically accessible stable configurations. This representation manifold is exponentially large in system size and is reachable through simple local dynamics, despite constituting a subdominant subset of the global configuration space. We further show that learning can be implemented directly on this structure via a fully local, gradient-free mechanism that selectively stabilizes a single task-relevant network configuration. Unlike error-driven or contrastive learning schemes, this approach does not require explicit comparisons between network states obtained with and without output supervision. Instead, transient supervisory signals bias the dynamics toward the representation manifold, after which local plasticity consolidates the attained configuration, effectively shaping the latent representation space. Numerical evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate performance comparable to that of multilayer perceptrons trained using backpropagation. More generally, these results suggest that the dynamical accessibility of fixed points and the stabilization of internal network dynamics constitute viable alternative principles for learning in recurrent systems, with conceptual links to statistical physics and potential implications for biologically motivated and neuromorphic computing architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing "negative transfer" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019]. We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience) and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions (ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance. For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to 0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[LIMO: Low-Power In-Memory-Annealer and Matrix-Multiplication Primitive for Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23212v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) underpins applications in science and engineering, ranging from logistics to electronic design automation. A classic example is the NP-complete Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Finding exact solutions for large-scale TSP instances remains computationally intractable; on von Neumann architectures, such solvers are constrained by the memory wall, incurring compute-memory traffic that grows with instance size. Metaheuristics, such as simulated annealing implemented on compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures, offer a way to mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck. This is accomplished by performing in-memory optimization cycles to rapidly find approximate solutions for TSP instances. Yet this approach suffers from degrading solution quality as instance size increases, owing to inefficient state-space exploration. To address this, we present LIMO, a mixed-signal computational macro that implements an in-memory annealing algorithm with reduced search-space complexity. The annealing process is aided by the stochastic switching of spin-transfer-torque magnetic-tunnel-junctions (STT-MTJs) to escape local minima. For large instances, our macro co-design is complemented by a refinement-based divide-and-conquer algorithm amenable to parallel optimization in a spatial architecture. Consequently, our system comprising several LIMO macros achieves superior solution quality and faster time-to-solution on instances up to 85,900 cities compared to prior hardware annealers. The modularity of our annealing peripherals allows the LIMO macro to be reused for other applications, such as vector-matrix multiplications (VMMs). This enables our architecture to support neural network inference.

Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component. Our approach provides a new framework for understanding and controlling task vector arithmetic, addressing fundamental limitations in model editing operations.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[Language-Informed Hyperspectral Image Synthesis for Imbalanced-Small Sample Classification via Semi-Supervised Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19700v4)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation effectively addresses the imbalanced-small sample data (ISSD) problem in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). While most methodologies extend features in the latent space, few leverage text-driven generation to create realistic and diverse samples. Recently, text-guided diffusion models have gained significant attention due to their ability to generate highly diverse and high-quality images based on text prompts in natural image synthesis. Motivated by this, this paper proposes Txt2HSI-LDM(VAE), a novel language-informed hyperspectral image synthesis method to address the ISSD in HSIC. The proposed approach uses a denoising diffusion model, which iteratively removes Gaussian noise to generate hyperspectral samples conditioned on textual descriptions. First, to address the high-dimensionality of hyperspectral data, a universal variational autoencoder (VAE) is designed to map the data into a low-dimensional latent space, which provides stable features and reduces the inference complexity of diffusion model. Second, a semi-supervised diffusion model is designed to fully take advantage of unlabeled data. Random polygon spatial clipping (RPSC) and uncertainty estimation of latent feature (LF-UE) are used to simulate the varying degrees of mixing. Third, the VAE decodes HSI from latent space generated by the diffusion model with the language conditions as input. In our experiments, we fully evaluate synthetic samples' effectiveness from statistical characteristics and data distribution in 2D-PCA space. Additionally, visual-linguistic cross-attention is visualized on the pixel level to prove that our proposed model can capture the spatial layout and geometry of the generated data. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed Txt2HSI-LDM(VAE) surpasses the classical backbone models, state-of-the-art CNNs, and semi-supervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Co-Teaching for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01210v4)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) essentially trades a model's performance on a source domain for improving its performance on a target domain. To overcome this, Unsupervised Domain Expansion (UDE) has been introduced, which adapts the model to the target domain while preserving its performance in the source domain. In both UDA and UDE, a model tailored to a given domain is assumed to well handle samples from the given domain. We question the assumption by reporting the existence of cross-domain visual ambiguity: Due to the unclear boundary between the two domains, samples from one domain can be visually close to the other domain. Such sorts of samples are typically in the minority in their host domain, so they tend to be overlooked by the domain-specific model, but can be better handled by a model from the other domain. We exploit this finding by proposing Co-Teaching (CT), which is instantiated with knowledge distillation based CT (kdCT) plus mixup based CT (miCT). Specifically, kdCT leverages a dual-teacher architecture to enhance the student network's ability to handle cross-domain ambiguity. Meanwhile, miCT further enhances the generalization ability of the student. Extensive experiments on image classification and driving-scene segmentation show the viability of CT for UDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a long paper at MMM 2026</p></details> | None |

Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2]. The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 19 diagrams.

This addresses a critical and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3 synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to 38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data characterization and fine-grained data selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and dataset are available here: https://github.com/r2llab/SynQuE</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/r2llab/SynQuE) |

However, publicly available ECG data, and thus most related research, relies on digital signals. This has led to a disconnect in which computer assisted interpretation of ECG cannot easily be applied to ECG images. The emergence of high-fidelity synthetic data generators has introduced practical alternatives by producing realistic, photo-like, ECG images derived from the digital signal that could help narrow this divide. To address this, we propose a novel knowledge augmentation framework that uses synthetic data generated from multiple sources to provide generalisable and accurate interpretation of ECG photographs. Our framework features two key contributions. First, we introduce a robust pre-processing pipeline designed to remove background artifacts and reduces visual differences between images. Second, we implement a two-stage training strategy: a Morphology Learning Stage, where the model captures broad morphological features from visually different, scan-like synthetic data, followed by a Task-Specific Adaptation Stage, where the model is fine-tuned on the photo-like target data. We tested the model on the British Heart Foundation Challenge dataset, to classify five common ECG findings: myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation, hypertrophy, conduction disturbance, and ST/T changes. Our approach, built upon the ConvNeXt backbone, outperforms a single-source training baseline and achieved \textbf{1st} place in the challenge with an macro-AUROC of \textbf{0.9677}. These results suggest that incorporating morphology learning from heterogeneous sources offers a more robust and generalizable paradigm than conventional single-source training.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

In recent years, more intelligent livestock monitoring solutions have been proposed to enhance farming efficiency and productivity. This work presents a novel approach to animal activity recognition and movement tracking, leveraging tiny machine learning (TinyML) techniques, wireless communication framework, and microcontroller platforms to develop an efficient, cost-effective livestock sensing system. It collects and fuses accelerometer data and vision inputs to build a multimodal network for three tasks: image classification, object detection, and behavior recognition. The system is deployed and evaluated on commercial microcontrollers for real-time inference using embedded applications, demonstrating up to 270$\times$ model size reduction, less than 80ms response latency, and on-par performance comparable to existing methods. The incorporation of the wireless communication technique allows for seamless data transmission between devices, benefiting use cases in remote locations with poor Internet connectivity. This work delivers a robust, scalable IoT-edge livestock monitoring solution adaptable to diverse farming needs, offering flexibility for future extensions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Do Generalized-Gamma Scale Mixtures of Normals Fit Large Image Datasets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17038v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A scale mixture of normals is a distribution formed by mixing a collection of normal distributions with fixed mean but different variances. A generalized gamma scale mixture draws the variances from a generalized gamma distribution. Generalized gamma scale mixtures of normals have been proposed as an attractive class of parametric priors for Bayesian inference in inverse imaging problems. Generalized gamma scale mixtures have two shape parameters, one that controls the behavior of the distribution about its mode, and the other that controls its tail decay. In this paper, we provide the first demonstration that the prior model is realistic for multiple large imaging data sets. We draw data from remote sensing, medical imaging, and image classification applications. We study the realism of the prior when applied to Fourier and wavelet (Haar and Gabor) transformations of the images, as well as to the coefficients produced by convolving the images against the filters used in the first layer of AlexNet, a popular convolutional neural network trained for image classification. We discuss data augmentation procedures that improve the fit of the model, procedures for identifying approximately exchangeable coefficients, and characterize the parameter regions that best describe the observed data sets. These regions are significantly broader than the region of primary focus in computational work. We show that this prior family provides a substantially better fit to each data set than any of the standard priors it contains. These include Gaussian, Laplace, $\ell_p$, and Student's $t$ priors. Finally, we identify cases where the prior is unrealistic and highlight characteristic features of images that suggest the model will fit poorly.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages main text, 21 figures, 7 tables, 6 pages appendix</p></details> | None |
| **[FedDPC : Handling Data Heterogeneity and Partial Client Participation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20329v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[SPECIAL: Zero-shot Hyperspectral Image Classification With CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16222v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to categorize each pixel in an HSI into a specific land cover class, which is crucial for applications such as remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and agriculture. Although deep learning-based HSI classification methods have achieved significant advancements, existing methods still rely on manually labeled data for training, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel zero-shot hyperspectral image classification framework based on CLIP (SPECIAL), aiming to eliminate the need for manual annotations. The SPECIAL framework consists of two main stages: (1) CLIP-based pseudo-label generation, and (2) noisy label learning. In the first stage, HSI is spectrally interpolated to produce RGB bands. These bands are subsequently classified using CLIP, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that are accompanied by confidence scores. To improve the quality of these labels, we propose a scaling strategy that fuses predictions from multiple spatial scales. In the second stage, spectral information and a label refinement technique are incorporated to mitigate label noise and further enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPECIAL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot HSI classification, showing its potential for more practical applications.

A real-time normalization method using an exponential decay function is introduced to construct the time-surface, reducing hardware usage while preserving temporal information. The circuit design utilizes the leakage characterization of Dynamic Random Access Memory(DRAM) for timestamp normalization. Custom interdigitated metal-oxide-metal capacitor (MOMCAP) is used to store the charge and low leakage switch (LL switch) is used to extend the effective charge storage time. The 3DS-ISC architecture integrates sensing, memory, and computation to overcome the memory wall problem, reducing power, latency, and reducing area by 69x, 2.2x and 1.9x, respectively, compared with its 2D counterpart. Moreover, compared to works using a 16-bit SRAM to store timestamps, the ISC analog array can reduce power consumption by three orders of magnitude. In real computer vision (CV) tasks, we applied the spatial-temporal correlation filter (STCF) for denoise, and 3D-ISC achieved almost equivalent accuracy compared to the digital implementation using high precision timestamps. As for the image classification, time-surface constructed by 3D-ISC is used as the input of GoogleNet, achieving 99% on N-MNIST, 85% on N-Caltech101, 78% on CIFAR10-DVS, and 97% on DVS128 Gesture, comparable with state-of-the-art results on each dataset. Additionally, the 3D-ISC method is also applied to image reconstruction using the DAVIS240C dataset, achieving the highest average SSIM (0.62) among three methods. This work establishes a foundation for real-time, resource-efficient event-based processing and points to future integration of advanced computational circuits for broader applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gaussian Process Assisted Meta-learning for Image Classification and Object Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20021v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting operationally realistic data to inform machine learning models can be costly. Before collecting new data, it is helpful to understand where a model is deficient. For example, object detectors trained on images of rare objects may not be good at identification in poorly represented conditions. We offer a way of informing subsequent data acquisition to maximize model performance by leveraging the toolkit of computer experiments and metadata describing the circumstances under which the training data was collected (e.g., season, time of day, location). We do this by evaluating the learner as the training data is varied according to its metadata. A Gaussian process (GP) surrogate fit to that response surface can inform new data acquisitions. This meta-learning approach offers improvements to learner performance as compared to data with randomly selected metadata, which we illustrate on both classic learning examples, and on a motivating application involving the collection of aerial images in search of airplanes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures | None |

However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HVAdam: A Full-Dimension Adaptive Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20277v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have achieved great success in training large-scale models like large language models and diffusion models. However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI2025 | None |

The evaluation is conducted initially on a non-convex benchmark function and subsequently on a real-world ML dataset. The initial comparative study using the Adam optimiser is conducted on a stochastic variant of the highly non-convex and notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function, renowned for its narrow, curved valley, across dimensions ranging from 2D to 1000D and an extreme case of 50,000D. Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved superior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a limiting variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a sign-based momentum-like update, highlighting conceptual connections between the inherent mechanisms of ArcGD and the Lion optimiser.</p></details> | <details><summary>80 pa...</summary><p>80 pages, 6 tables, 2 figures, 5 appendices, proof-of-concept</p></details> | None |

However, previous well-established DNNs, despite being able to maintain superior accuracy, have also been evolving to be deeper and wider and thus inevitably necessitate prohibitive computational resources for both training and inference. This trend further enlarges the computational gap between computation-intensive DNNs and resource-constrained embedded computing systems, making it challenging to deploy powerful DNNs upon real-world embedded computing systems towards ubiquitous embedded intelligence. To alleviate the above computational gap and enable ubiquitous embedded intelligence, we, in this survey, focus on discussing recent efficient deep learning infrastructures for embedded computing systems, spanning from training to inference, from manual to automated, from convolutional neural networks to transformers, from transformers to vision transformers, from vision models to large language models, from software to hardware, and from algorithms to applications.

Seeds, as important archaeological artifacts, represent a fundamental subject of archaeobotanical research. However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key "evidence" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information. We propose an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture based on traditional progressive learning to decode features from both channel and spatial perspectives, enabling efficient learning of discriminative features. In both quantitative and qualitative analyses, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art image classification methods, achieving an accuracy of 90.5%. This demonstrates that our work provides an effective tool for large-scale, systematic archaeological research.</p></details> |  | None |

We present a Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC) that leverages image priors to guide locality-preserving encoding and entanglement via non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows. The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles, where entanglement is applied among qubits hosting neighboring pixels, aligned to device connectivity. This staged, locality-preserving information flow expands the effective receptive field without deep global mixing, enabling efficient use of limited depth and qubits. The design concentrates representational capacity on short-range correlations, reduces long-range two-qubit operations, and encourages stable optimization, thereby mitigating depth-induced and globally entangled barren-plateau effects. We evaluate DAQC on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and PneumoniaMNIST datasets. On quantum hardware, DAQC achieves performance competitive with strong classical baselines (e.g., ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) and substantially outperforming Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) baselines. To the best of our knowledge, DAQC, which uses a quantum feature extractor with only a linear classical readout (no deep classical backbone), currently achieves the best reported performance on real quantum hardware for QML-based image classification tasks.

While CNNs excel at local feature extraction and transformers capture long-range dependencies, their isolated application yields suboptimal results due to quadratic complexity and insufficient inductive biases. We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck. The model employs a multi-scale convolutional stem with deep residual blocks and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module for hierarchical spatial features, followed by spectral encoder layers combining bidirectional RNNs (LSTM/GRU) with Multi-Scale Spectral Latent Attention (MSLA). MSLA reduces complexity from $\mathcal{O}(T^2D)$ to $\mathcal{O}(T\log(T)D)$ by adaptive latent token allocation (8-64 tokens) that scales logarithmically with the sequence length. Hierarchical cross-attention fusion dynamically aggregates multi-level representations for robust classification. Experiments conducted on the Indian Pines and Salinas datasets show state-of-the-art performance, achieving overall accuracies of 99.71% and 99.96%, significantly surpassing HybridSN, SSRN, and SpectralFormer. The learned embeddings exhibit superior inter-class separability and compact intra-class clustering, validating CLAReSNet's effectiveness under severe class imbalance.</p></details> |  | None |

Experimental results demonstrate that quantized models achieve substantial reductions in model size and inference latency, enabling real-time processing on edge hardware while maintaining clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy.

Existing resources are often limited in geographic scope and annotation detail, hindering the development of robust, generalized computer vision methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIFloodSense, a comprehensive, publicly available aerial imagery dataset comprising 470 high-resolution images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and six continents. Unlike prior benchmarks, AIFloodSense ensures global diversity and temporal relevance (2022-2024), supporting three complementary tasks: (i) Image Classification with novel sub-tasks for environment type, camera angle, and continent recognition; (ii) Semantic Segmentation providing precise pixel-level masks for flood, sky, and buildings; and (iii) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable natural language reasoning for disaster assessment. We establish baseline benchmarks for all tasks using state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating the dataset's complexity and its value in advancing domain-generalized AI tools for climate resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 19 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Can Synthetic Images Serve as Effective and Efficient Class Prototypes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17160v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do Generalized=Gamma Scale Mixtures of Normals Fit Large Image Data-Sets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17038v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A scale mixture of normals is a distribution formed by mixing a collection of normal distributions with fixed mean but different variances. A generalized gamma scale mixture draws the variances from a generalized gamma distribution. Generalized gamma scale mixtures of normals have been proposed as an attractive class of parametric priors for Bayesian inference in inverse imaging problems. Generalized gamma scale mixtures have two shape parameters, one that controls the behavior of the distribution about its mode, and the other that controls its tail decay. In this paper, we provide the first demonstration that the prior model is realistic for multiple large imaging data sets. We draw data from remote sensing, medical imaging, and image classification applications. We study the realism of the prior when applied to Fourier and wavelet (Haar and Gabor) transformations of the images, as well as to the coefficients produced by convolving the images against the filters used in the first layer of AlexNet, a popular convolutional neural network trained for image classification. We discuss data augmentation procedures that improve the fit of the model, procedures for identifying approximately exchangeable coefficients, and characterize the parameter regions that best describe the observed data sets. These regions are significantly broader than the region of primary focus in computational work. We show that this prior family provides a substantially better fit to each data set than any of the standard priors it contains. These include Gaussian, Laplace, $\ell_p$, and Student's $t$ priors. Finally, we identify cases where the prior is unrealistic and highlight characteristic features of images that suggest the model will fit poorly.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages main text, 21 figures, 7 tables, 6 pages appendix</p></details> | None |
| **[Protecting Deep Neural Network Intellectual Property with Chaos-Based White-Box Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16658v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of deep neural networks (DNNs) across several domains has led to increasing concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection and model misuse. Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SCS-SupCon: Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Decision Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17954v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification is hindered by subtle inter-class differences and substantial intra-class variations, which limit the effectiveness of existing contrastive learning methods. Supervised contrastive approaches based on the InfoNCE loss suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, thereby reducing discriminative power in fine-grained recognition tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision. In addition, an explicit style-distance constraint further disentangles style and content representations, leading to more robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art performance across both CNN and Transformer backbones. On CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50, SCS-SupCon improves top-1 accuracy over SupCon by approximately 3.9 percentage points and over CS-SupCon by approximately 1.7 points under five-fold cross-validation. On fine-grained datasets, it outperforms CS-SupCon by 0.4--3.0 points. Extensive ablation studies and statistical analyses further confirm the robustness and generalization of the proposed framework, with Friedman tests and Nemenyi post-hoc evaluations validating the stability of the observed improvements.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stylized Synthetic Augmentation further improves Corruption Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15675v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VISAPP 2026 conference</p></details> | None |
| **[Vision-based module for accurately reading linear scales in a laboratory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15327v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.</p></details> | 10 pages, 16 figures | None |
| **[TrajSyn: Privacy-Preserving Dataset Distillation from Federated Model Trajectories for Server-Side Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15123v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models deployed on edge devices are increasingly used in safety-critical applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TomoGraphView: 3D Medical Image Classification with Omnidirectional Slice Representations and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09605v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)</p></details> | [Code Link](http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle) |
| **[FoodLogAthl-218: Constructing a Real-World Food Image Dataset Using Dietary Management Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14574v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Food image classification models are crucial for dietary management applications because they reduce the burden of manual meal logging. However, most publicly available datasets for training such models rely on web-crawled images, which often differ from users' real-world meal photos. In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context. We evaluate these tasks using large multimodal models (LMMs). The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FoodLog/FoodLogAthl-218.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CrossPT-EEG: A Benchmark for Cross-Participant and Cross-Time Generalization of EEG-based Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07151v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring brain activity in relation to visual perception provides insights into the biological representation of the world. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have enabled effective image classification and reconstruction, their high cost and bulk limit practical use. Electroencephalography (EEG), by contrast, offers low cost and excellent temporal resolution, but its potential has been limited by the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets and by block-design experiments that introduce temporal confounds. To fill this gap, we present CrossPT-EEG, a benchmark for cross-participant and cross-time generalization of visual decoding from EEG. We collected EEG data from 16 participants while they viewed 4,000 images sampled from ImageNet, with image stimuli annotated at multiple levels of granularity. Our design includes two stages separated in time to allow cross-time generalization and avoid block-design artifacts. We also introduce benchmarks tailored to non-block design classification, as well as pre-training experiments to assess cross-time and cross-participant generalization. These findings highlight the dataset's potential to enhance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, deepen our understanding of visual perception in biological systems, and suggest promising applications for improving machine vision models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Semantic Uncertainty Quantification in LVLMs with Semantic Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14177v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[REP: Resource-Efficient Prompting for Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04772v6)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rehearsal-free continual learning (CL) methods guided by prompts achieve strong performance on vision tasks with non-stationary data but remain resource-intensive, hindering real-world edge deployment. We introduce resource-efficient prompting (REP), which improves the computational and memory efficiency of prompt-based rehearsal-free continual learning methods while minimizing accuracy trade-offs. Our approach employs swift prompt selection to refine input data using a carefully provisioned model and introduces adaptive token merging (AToM) and adaptive layer dropping (ALD) for efficient prompt updates. AToM and ALD selectively skip data and model layers while preserving task-specific features during the learning of new tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets demonstrate REP's superior resource efficiency over state-of-the-art rehearsal-free CL methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |
| **[Hardware-Aware DNN Compression for Homogeneous Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00017v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) across homogeneous edge devices (the devices with the same SKU labeled by the manufacturer) often assumes identical performance among them. However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Extensive experiments on multiple device types (Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano) and task types (image classification with ResNet50, MobileNetV1, ResNet56, VGG16; object detection with YOLOv8n) demonstrate that HDAP consistently achieves lower average latency and competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant speedups (e.g., 2.86$\times$ on ResNet50 at 1.0G FLOPs). HDAP offers an effective solution for scalable, high-performance DNN deployment methods for homogeneous edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission was created unintentionally when attempting to submit a new version of an existing paper.
