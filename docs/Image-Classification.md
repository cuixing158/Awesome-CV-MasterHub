| **[VESTA: A Versatile SNN-Based Transformer Accelerator with Unified PEs for Multiple Computational Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20246v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and transformers represent two powerful paradigms in neural computation, known for their low power consumption and ability to capture feature dependencies, respectively. However, transformer architectures typically involve multiple types of computational layers, including linear layers for MLP modules and classification heads, convolution layers for tokenizers, and dot product computations for self-attention mechanisms. These diverse operations pose significant challenges for hardware accelerator design, and to our knowledge, there is not yet a hardware solution that leverages spike-form data from SNNs for transformer architectures. In this paper, we introduce VESTA, a novel hardware design that synergizes these technologies, presenting unified Processing Elements (PEs) capable of efficiently performing all three types of computations crucial to transformer structures. VESTA uniquely benefits from the spike-form outputs of the Spike Neuron Layers \cite{zhou2024spikformer}, simplifying multiplication operations by reducing them from handling two 8-bit integers to handling one 8-bit integer and a binary spike. This reduction enables the use of multiplexers in the PE module, significantly enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining the low-power advantage of SNNs. Experimental results show that the core area of VESTA is \(0.844 mm^2\). It operates at 500MHz and is capable of real-time image classification at 30 fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in 2024 Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (APCCAS 2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[Explaining Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification by Evolving Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15143v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep convolutional neural networks have proven their effectiveness, and have been acknowledged as the most dominant method for image classification. However, a severe drawback of deep convolutional neural networks is poor explainability. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, users need to understand the rationale behind the predictions of deep convolutional neural networks when determining whether they should trust the predictions or not. To resolve this issue, a novel genetic algorithm-based method is proposed for the first time to automatically evolve local explanations that can assist users to assess the rationality of the predictions. Furthermore, the proposed method is model-agnostic, i.e., it can be utilised to explain any deep convolutional neural network models. In the experiments, ResNet is used as an example model to be explained, and the ImageNet dataset is selected as the benchmark dataset. DenseNet and MobileNet are further explained to demonstrate the model-agnostic characteristic of the proposed method. The evolved local explanations on four images, randomly selected from ImageNet, are presented, which show that the evolved local explanations are straightforward to be recognised by humans. Moreover, the evolved explanations can explain the predictions of deep convolutional neural networks on all four images very well by successfully capturing meaningful interpretable features of the sample images. Further analysis based on the 30 runs of the experiments exhibits that the evolved local explanations can also improve the probabilities/confidences of the deep convolutional neural network models in making the predictions. The proposed method can obtain local explanations within one minute, which is more than ten times faster than LIME (the state-of-the-art method).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Extensions of regret-minimization algorithm for optimal design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19874v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore extensions and applications of the regret minimization framework introduced by~\cite{design} for solving optimal experimental design problems. Specifically, we incorporate the entropy regularizer into this framework, leading to a novel sample selection objective and a provable sample complexity bound that guarantees a $(1+\epsilon)$-near optimal solution. We further extend the method to handle regularized optimal design settings. As an application, we use our algorithm to select a small set of representative samples from image classification datasets without relying on label information. To evaluate the quality of the selected samples, we train a logistic regression model and compare performance against several baseline sampling strategies. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a 50-class subset of ImageNet show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods in most cases.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIP-EBC: CLIP Can Count Accurately through Enhanced Blockwise Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09281v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose CLIP-EBC, the first fully CLIP-based model for accurate crowd density estimation. While the CLIP model has demonstrated remarkable success in addressing recognition tasks such as zero-shot image classification, its potential for counting has been largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges in transforming a regression problem, such as counting, into a recognition task. In this work, we investigate and enhance CLIP's ability to count, focusing specifically on the task of estimating crowd sizes from images. Existing classification-based crowd-counting frameworks have significant limitations, including the quantization of count values into bordering real-valued bins and the sole focus on classification errors. These practices result in label ambiguity near the shared borders and inaccurate prediction of count values. Hence, directly applying CLIP within these frameworks may yield suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we first propose the Enhanced Blockwise Classification (EBC) framework. Unlike previous methods, EBC utilizes integer-valued bins, effectively reducing ambiguity near bin boundaries. Additionally, it incorporates a regression loss based on density maps to improve the prediction of count values. Within our backbone-agnostic EBC framework, we then introduce CLIP-EBC to fully leverage CLIP's recognition capabilities for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EBC and the competitive performance of CLIP-EBC. Specifically, our EBC framework can improve existing classification-based methods by up to 44.5% on the UCF-QNRF dataset, and CLIP-EBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NWPU-Crowd test set, with an MAE of 58.2 and an RMSE of 268.5, representing improvements of 8.6% and 13.3% over the previous best method, STEERER.

| **[Interpretable Bilingual Multimodal Large Language Model for Diverse Biomedical Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18387v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several medical Multimodal Large Languange Models (MLLMs) have been developed to address tasks involving visual images with textual instructions across various medical modalities, achieving impressive results. Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence. To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Optimizing Breast Cancer Detection in Mammograms: A Comprehensive Study of Transfer Learning, Resolution Reduction, and Multi-View Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19945v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores open questions in the application of machine learning for breast cancer detection in mammograms. Current approaches often employ a two-stage transfer learning process: first, adapting a backbone model trained on natural images to develop a patch classifier, which is then used to create a single-view whole-image classifier. Additionally, many studies leverage both mammographic views to enhance model performance. In this work, we systematically investigate five key questions: (1) Is the intermediate patch classifier essential for optimal performance? (2) Do backbone models that excel in natural image classification consistently outperform others on mammograms? (3) When reducing mammogram resolution for GPU processing, does the learn-to-resize technique outperform conventional methods? (4) Does incorporating both mammographic views in a two-view classifier significantly improve detection accuracy? (5) How do these findings vary when analyzing low-quality versus high-quality mammograms? By addressing these questions, we developed models that outperform previous results for both single-view and two-view classifiers. Our findings provide insights into model architecture and transfer learning strategies contributing to more accurate and efficient mammogram analysis.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[VectorFit : Adaptive Singular & Bias Vector Fine-Tuning of Pre-trained Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19530v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular PEFT methods achieve parameter efficiency by assuming that incremental weight updates are inherently low-rank, which often leads to a performance gap compared to full fine-tuning. While recent methods have attempted to address this limitation, they typically lack sufficient parameter and memory efficiency. We propose VectorFit, an effective and easily deployable approach that adaptively trains the singular vectors and biases of pre-trained weight matrices. We demonstrate that the utilization of structural and transformational characteristics of pre-trained weights enables high-rank updates comparable to those of full fine-tuning. As a result, VectorFit achieves superior performance with 9X less trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Through extensive experiments over 17 datasets spanning diverse language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we exhibit that VectorFit consistently outperforms baselines, even in extremely low-budget scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pathological Prior-Guided Multiple Instance Learning For Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Breast Cancer Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06056v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In histopathology, intelligent diagnosis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is essential for automating and objectifying diagnoses, reducing the workload of pathologists. However, diagnostic models often face the challenge of forgetting previously learned data during incremental training on datasets from different sources. To address this issue, we propose a new framework PaGMIL to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in breast cancer WSI classification. Our framework introduces two key components into the common MIL model architecture. First, it leverages microscopic pathological prior to select more accurate and diverse representative patches for MIL. Secondly, it trains separate classification heads for each task and uses macroscopic pathological prior knowledge, treating the thumbnail as a prompt guide (PG) to select the appropriate classification head. We evaluate the continual learning performance of PaGMIL across several public breast cancer datasets. PaGMIL achieves a better balance between the performance of the current task and the retention of previous tasks, outperforming other continual learning methods. Our code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | ICASSP2025(Oral) | None |
| **[CKD: Contrastive Knowledge Distillation from A Sample-wise Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14109v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective contrastive knowledge distillation framework that achieves sample-wise logit alignment while preserving semantic consistency. Conventional knowledge distillation approaches exhibit over-reliance on feature similarity per sample, which risks overfitting, and contrastive approaches focus on inter-class discrimination at the expense of intra-sample semantic relationships. Our approach transfers "dark knowledge" through teacher-student contrastive alignment at the sample level. Specifically, our method first enforces intra-sample alignment by directly minimizing teacher-student logit discrepancies within individual samples. Then, we utilize inter-sample contrasts to preserve semantic dissimilarities across samples. By redefining positive pairs as aligned teacher-student logits from identical samples and negative pairs as cross-sample logit combinations, we reformulate these dual constraints into an InfoNCE loss framework, reducing computational complexity lower than sample squares while eliminating dependencies on temperature parameters and large batch sizes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across three benchmark datasets, including the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS COCO datasets, and experimental results clearly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LRSCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Aligning Remote Sensing Image with Longer Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19311v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the technical bottlenecks in handling long text and the "hallucination" issue caused by insufficient short text information in remote sensing vision-language foundation models (VLFM). We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning. The related code has been open source and is available at https://github.com/MitsuiChen14/LRSCLIP.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/MitsuiChen14/LRSCLIP) |
| **[Face Spoofing Detection using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19223v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital image spoofing has emerged as a significant security threat in biometric authentication systems, particularly those relying on facial recognition. This study evaluates the performance of three vision based models, MobileNetV2, ResNET50, and Vision Transformer, ViT, for spoof detection in image classification, utilizing a dataset of 150,986 images divided into training , 140,002, testing, 10,984, and validation ,39,574, sets. Spoof detection is critical for enhancing the security of image recognition systems, and this research compares the models effectiveness through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Results reveal that MobileNetV2 outperforms other architectures on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy of 91.59%, precision of 91.72%, recall of 91.59%, and F1 score of 91.58%, compared to ViT 86.54%, 88.28%, 86.54%, and 86.39%, respectively. On the validation dataset, MobileNetV2, and ViT excel, with MobileNetV2 slightly ahead at 97.17% accuracy versus ViT 96.36%. MobileNetV2 demonstrates faster convergence during training and superior generalization to unseen data, despite both models showing signs of overfitting. These findings highlight MobileNetV2 balanced performance and robustness, making it the preferred choice for spoof detection applications where reliability on new data is essential. The study underscores the importance of model selection in security sensitive contexts and suggests MobileNetV2 as a practical solution for real world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures,3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Gradient-Guided Annealing for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20162v4)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) research has gained considerable traction as of late, since the ability to generalize to unseen data distributions is a requirement that eludes even state-of-the-art training algorithms. In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in CVPR2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Exploring the Integration of Key-Value Attention Into Pure and Hybrid Transformers for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18862v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While CNNs were long considered state of the art for image processing, the introduction of Transformer architectures has challenged this position. While achieving excellent results in image classification and segmentation, Transformers remain inherently reliant on large training datasets and remain computationally expensive. A newly introduced Transformer derivative named KV Transformer shows promising results in synthetic, NLP, and image classification tasks, while reducing complexity and memory usage. This is especially conducive to use cases where local inference is required, such as medical screening applications. We endeavoured to further evaluate the merit of KV Transformers on semantic segmentation tasks, specifically in the domain of medical imaging. By directly comparing traditional and KV variants of the same base architectures, we provide further insight into the practical tradeoffs of reduced model complexity. We observe a notable reduction in parameter count and multiply accumulate operations, while achieving similar performance from most of the KV variant models when directly compared to their QKV implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Preprint.

| **[Latent Space Class Dispersion: Effective Test Data Quality Assessment for DNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18799v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality test datasets are crucial for assessing the reliability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Mutation testing evaluates test dataset quality based on their ability to uncover injected faults in DNNs as measured by mutation score (MS). At the same time, its high computational cost motivates researchers to seek alternative test adequacy criteria. We propose Latent Space Class Dispersion (LSCD), a novel metric to quantify the quality of test datasets for DNNs. It measures the degree of dispersion within a test dataset as observed in the latent space of a DNN. Our empirical study shows that LSCD reveals and quantifies deficiencies in the test dataset of three popular benchmarks pertaining to image classification tasks using DNNs. Corner cases generated using automated fuzzing were found to help enhance fault detection and improve the overall quality of the original test sets calculated by MS and LSCD. Our experiments revealed a high positive correlation (0.87) between LSCD and MS, significantly higher than the one achieved by the well-studied Distance-based Surprise Coverage (0.25). These results were obtained from 129 mutants generated through pre-training mutation operators, with statistical significance and a high validity of corner cases. These observations suggest that LSCD can serve as a cost-effective alternative to expensive mutation testing, eliminating the need to generate mutant models while offering comparably valuable insights into test dataset quality for DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explaining Domain Shifts in Language: Concept erasing for Interpretable Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18483v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept-based models can map black-box representations to human-understandable concepts, which makes the decision-making process more transparent and then allows users to understand the reason behind predictions. However, domain-specific concepts often impact the final predictions, which subsequently undermine the model generalization capabilities, and prevent the model from being used in high-stake applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Language-guided Concept-Erasing (LanCE) framework. In particular, we empirically demonstrate that pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) can approximate distinct visual domain shifts via domain descriptors while prompting large Language Models (LLMs) can easily simulate a wide range of descriptors of unseen visual domains. Then, we introduce a novel plug-in domain descriptor orthogonality (DDO) regularizer to mitigate the impact of these domain-specific concepts on the final predictions. Notably, the DDO regularizer is agnostic to the design of concept-based models and we integrate it into several prevailing models. Through evaluation of domain generalization on four standard benchmarks and three newly introduced benchmarks, we demonstrate that DDO can significantly improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over the previous state-of-the-art concept-based models.Our code is available at https://github.com/joeyz0z/LanCE.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/joeyz0z/LanCE) |
| **[CoRLD: Contrastive Representation Learning Of Deformable Shapes In Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17162v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable shape representations, parameterized by deformations relative to a given template, have proven effective for improved image analysis tasks. However, their broader applicability is hindered by two major challenges. First, existing methods mainly rely on a known template during testing, which is impractical and limits flexibility. Second, they often struggle to capture fine-grained, voxel-level distinctions between similar shapes (e.g., anatomical variations among healthy individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment, and diseased states). To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework - Contrastive Representation Learning of Deformable shapes (CoRLD) in learned deformation spaces and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of image classification. Our CoRLD leverages a class-aware contrastive supervised learning objective in latent deformation spaces, promoting proximity among representations of similar classes while ensuring separation of dissimilar groups. In contrast to previous deep learning networks that require a reference image as input to predict deformation changes, our approach eliminates this dependency. Instead, template images are utilized solely as ground truth in the loss function during the training process, making our model more flexible and generalizable to a wide range of medical applications. We validate CoRLD on diverse datasets, including real brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) and adrenal shapes derived from computed tomography (CT) scans. Experimental results show that our model effectively extracts deformable shape features, which can be easily integrated with existing classifiers to substantially boost the classification accuracy.

| **[Feature Learning beyond the Lazy-Rich Dichotomy: Insights from Representational Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18114v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to integrate task-relevant information into neural representations is a fundamental aspect of both biological and artificial intelligence. To enable theoretical analysis, recent work has examined whether a network learns task-relevant features (rich learning) or resembles a random feature model (or a kernel machine, i.e., lazy learning). However, this simple lazy-versus-rich dichotomy overlooks the possibility of various subtypes of feature learning that emerge from different architectures, learning rules, and data properties. Furthermore, most existing approaches emphasize weight matrices or neural tangent kernels, limiting their applicability to neuroscience because they do not explicitly characterize representations. In this work, we introduce an analysis framework based on representational geometry to study feature learning. Instead of analyzing what are the learned features, we focus on characterizing how task-relevant representational manifolds evolve during the learning process. In both theory and experiment, we find that when a network learns features useful for solving a task, the task-relevant manifolds become increasingly untangled. Moreover, by tracking changes in the underlying manifold geometry, we uncover distinct learning stages throughout training, as well as different learning strategies associated with training hyperparameters, uncovering subtypes of feature learning beyond the lazy-versus-rich dichotomy. Applying our method to neuroscience and machine learning, we gain geometric insights into the structural inductive biases of neural circuits solving cognitive tasks and the mechanisms underlying out-of-distribution generalization in image classification. Our framework provides a novel geometric perspective for understanding and quantifying feature learning in both artificial and biological neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Self-supervised Vision Pretraining with Local Masked Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00790v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning for computer vision has achieved tremendous progress and improved many downstream vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Among these, generative self-supervised vision learning approaches such as MAE and BEiT show promising performance. However, their global masked reconstruction mechanism is computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose local masked reconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked reconstruction within a small window of 7$\times$7 patches on a simple Transformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy compared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained LoMaR on 384$\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing MAE by 0.6%. On MS COCO, LoMaR outperforms MAE by 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{box}$ on object detection and 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{mask}$ on instance segmentation. LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction learning mechanism can be easily integrated into any other generative self-supervised learning approach.

However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30\% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18242v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank adaptation, also known as LoRA, has emerged as a prominent method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. Despite its computational efficiency, LoRA still yields inferior performance compared to full fine-tuning. In this paper, we first uncover a fundamental connection between the optimization processes of LoRA and full fine-tuning: using LoRA for optimization is mathematically equivalent to full fine-tuning using a low-rank gradient for parameter updates. And this low-rank gradient can be expressed in terms of the gradients of the two low-rank matrices in LoRA. Leveraging this insight, we introduce LoRA-Pro, a method that enhances LoRA's performance by strategically adjusting the gradients of these low-rank matrices. This adjustment allows the low-rank gradient to more accurately approximate the full fine-tuning gradient, thereby narrowing the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the optimal solutions for adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices, applying them during fine-tuning in LoRA-Pro. We conduct extensive experiments across natural language understanding, dialogue generation, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and image classification tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-Pro substantially improves LoRA's performance, effectively narrowing the gap with full fine-tuning.

In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a technique to generate training samples with text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples for in which this correlation does not exist.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to adapt foundation models to new domains by updating only a small portion of parameters in order to reduce computational overhead. However, the effectiveness of these PEFT methods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image analysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of the performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate the limitations of prompt introducing ways and approximation capabilities on Transformer architectures of mainstream prompt tuning methods, we propose the Embedded Prompt Tuning (EPT) method by embedding prompt tokens into the expanded channels. We also find that there are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models during pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative impact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to understand prompt tuning: Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator. And we support it by analyzing patch-wise scaling and feature separation operations contained in EPT. Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot medical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process within highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method.

Yet, it is an open question which mechanisms take place during adaptation. Here we develop a new Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) for the CLIP vision transformer, named PatchSAE, to extract interpretable concepts at granular levels (e.g., shape, color, or semantics of an object) and their patch-wise spatial attributions. We explore how these concepts influence the model output in downstream image classification tasks and investigate how recent state-of-the-art prompt-based adaptation techniques change the association of model inputs to these concepts. While activations of concepts slightly change between adapted and non-adapted models, we find that the majority of gains on common adaptation tasks can be explained with the existing concepts already present in the non-adapted foundation model. This work provides a concrete framework to train and use SAEs for Vision Transformers and provides insights into explaining adaptation mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, they often fall short in other critical quality dimensions, such as robustness, calibration, or fairness. While existing studies have focused on a subset of these quality dimensions, none have explored a more general form of "well-behavedness" of DNNs. With this work, we address this gap by simultaneously studying nine different quality dimensions for image classification. Through a large-scale study, we provide a bird's-eye view by analyzing 326 backbone models and how different training paradigms and model architectures affect the quality dimensions. We reveal various new insights such that (i) vision-language models exhibit high fairness on ImageNet-1k classification and strong robustness against domain changes; (ii) self-supervised learning is an effective training paradigm to improve almost all considered quality dimensions; and (iii) the training dataset size is a major driver for most of the quality dimensions. We conclude our study by introducing the QUBA score (Quality Understanding Beyond Accuracy), a novel metric that ranks models across multiple dimensions of quality, enabling tailored recommendations based on specific user needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/visinf/beyond-accuracy</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/visinf/beyond-accuracy) |

However, machine vision achieved by DNNs cannot be as robust as human perception. Adversarial attacks and data distribution shifts have been known as two major scenarios which degrade machine performance and obstacle the wide deployment of machines "in the wild". In order to break these obstructions and facilitate the research of model robustness, we develop EasyRobust, a comprehensive and easy-to-use toolkit for training, evaluation and analysis of robust vision models. EasyRobust targets at two types of robustness: 1) Adversarial robustness enables the model to defense against malicious inputs crafted by worst-case perturbations, also known as adversarial examples; 2) Non-adversarial robustness enhances the model performance on natural test images with corruptions or distribution shifts. Thorough benchmarks on image classification enable EasyRobust to provide an accurate robustness evaluation on vision models. We wish our EasyRobust can help for training practically-robust models and promote academic and industrial progress in closing the gap between human and machine vision.

Inspired by this, we propose JPEG-DL, a novel DL framework that prepends any underlying DNN architecture with a trainable JPEG compression layer. To make the quantization operation in JPEG compression trainable, a new differentiable soft quantizer is employed at the JPEG layer, and then the quantization operation and underlying DNN are jointly trained. Extensive experiments show that in comparison with the standard DL, JPEG-DL delivers significant accuracy improvements across various datasets and model architectures while enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks. Particularly, on some fine-grained image classification datasets, JPEG-DL can increase prediction accuracy by as much as 20.9%.

AI-driven automated classification has emerged as a promising solution, with deep learning models demonstrating impressive performance in plant disease identification. However, deploying these models on mobile and edge devices remains challenging due to high computational demands and resource constraints, highlighting the need for lightweight, accurate solutions for accessible smart agriculture systems. To address this, we propose MobilePlantViT, a novel hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture designed for generalized plant disease classification, which optimizes resource efficiency while maintaining high performance.

WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

Recent research has shown that although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are initially poor at image classification, fine-tuning them with an adequate amount of data can significantly enhance their performance, making them comparable to SOTA classification models. However, acquiring large-scale labeled data is expensive. In this paper, we explore few-shot MLLM classification fine-tuning. We found that SFT can cause severe overfitting issues and may even degrade performance over the zero-shot approach. To address this challenge, inspired by the recent successes in rule-based reinforcement learning, we propose CLS-RL, which uses verifiable signals as reward to fine-tune MLLMs. We discovered that CLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has a much higher average accuracy on both base-to-new and few-shot learning setting. Moreover, we observed a free-lunch phenomenon for CLS-RL; when models are fine-tuned on a particular dataset, their performance on other distinct datasets may also improve over zero-shot models, even if those datasets differ in distribution and class names. This suggests that RL-based methods effectively teach models the fundamentals of classification. Lastly, inspired by recent works in inference time thinking, we re-examine the `thinking process' during fine-tuning, a critical aspect of RL-based methods, in the context of visual classification. We question whether such tasks require extensive thinking process during fine-tuning, proposing that this may actually detract from performance. Based on this premise, we introduce the No-Thinking-CLS-RL method, which minimizes thinking processes during training by setting an equality accuracy reward. Our findings indicate that, with much less fine-tuning time, No-Thinking-CLS-RL method achieves superior in-domain performance and generalization capabilities than CLS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> | None |

A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis.

Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data. We expand on this line of research by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. We also present a theoretical analysis on how the accuracy estimator variance depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. Finally, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms training on real data mined from the dataset used in the original diffusion model training.

Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated with Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by 6.77% on average and retrieval performance by 4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model.

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-weighted contrastive learning approach that avoids the use of superpixel partitioning and directly employs neural networks to learn hyperspectral image representation. Furthermore, while many approaches require all graph nodes to be available during training, our approach supports mini-batch training by processing only a subset of nodes at a time, reducing computational complexity and improving generalization to unseen nodes. Experimental results on three widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to baselines relying on superpixel partitioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Electronic Imaging, 2025</p></details> | None |

This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present the first comprehensive QML study by benchmarking the MedMNIST-a diverse collection of medical imaging datasets on a 127-qubit real IBM quantum hardware, to evaluate the feasibility and performance of quantum models (without any classical neural networks) in practical applications. This study explores recent advancements in quantum computing such as device-aware quantum circuits, error suppression, and mitigation for medical image classification. Our methodology is comprised of three stages: preprocessing, generation of noise-resilient and hardware-efficient quantum circuits, optimizing/training of quantum circuits on classical hardware, and inference on real IBM quantum hardware. Firstly, we process all input images in the preprocessing stage to reduce the spatial dimension due to quantum hardware limitations. We generate hardware-efficient quantum circuits using backend properties expressible to learn complex patterns for medical image classification. After classical optimization of QML models, we perform inference on real quantum hardware. We also incorporate advanced error suppression and mitigation techniques in our QML workflow, including dynamical decoupling (DD), gate twirling, and matrix-free measurement mitigation (M3) to mitigate the effects of noise and improve classification performance.

Detecting poisoned samples (i.e., those containing triggers) at test time can prevent backdoor activation. However, unlike image classification tasks, the unique characteristics of object detection -- particularly its output of numerous objects -- pose fresh challenges for backdoor detection. The complex attack effects (e.g., "ghost" object emergence or "vanishing" object) further render current defenses fundamentally inadequate. To this end, we design TRAnsformation Consistency Evaluation (TRACE), a brand-new method for detecting poisoned samples at test time in object detection. Our journey begins with two intriguing observations: (1) poisoned samples exhibit significantly more consistent detection results than clean ones across varied backgrounds. (2) clean samples show higher detection consistency when introduced to different focal information. Based on these phenomena, TRACE applies foreground and background transformations to each test sample, then assesses transformation consistency by calculating the variance in objects confidences. TRACE achieves black-box, universal backdoor detection, with extensive experiments showing a 30% improvement in AUROC over state-of-the-art defenses and resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Conventional deep learning models tend to produce overconfident predictions despite underlying uncertainties, potentially leading to misdiagnoses. Attention mechanisms have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of the input data. Combined with feature fusion, they can be effective in addressing uncertainty challenges. Cross-attention has become increasingly important in medical image analysis for capturing dependencies across features and modalities. This paper proposes a novel dual cross-attention fusion model for medical image analysis by addressing key challenges in feature integration and interpretability. Our approach introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism with refined channel and spatial attention that dynamically fuses feature maps from EfficientNetB4 and ResNet34 leveraging multi-network contextual dependencies. The refined features through channel and spatial attention highlights discriminative patterns crucial for accurate classification. The proposed model achieved AUC of 99.75%, 100%, 99.93% and 98.69% and AUPR of 99.81%, 100%, 99.97%, and 96.36% on Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia Chest X-ray images and Retinal OCT images respectively. The entropy values and several high uncertain samples give an interpretable visualization from the model enhancing transparency.

Despite the overlap in motivation between these tasks, the methods themselves are restricted to a single task -- GCD methods are reliant on the labeled portion of the data, and deep image clustering methods have no built-in way to leverage the labels efficiently. We connect the two regimes with an innovative approach that Utilizes Neighbor Information for Classification (UNIC) both in the unsupervised (clustering) and semisupervised (GCD) setting. State-of-the-art clustering methods already rely heavily on nearest neighbors. We improve on their results substantially in two parts, first with a sampling and cleaning strategy where we identify accurate positive and negative neighbors, and secondly by finetuning the backbone with clustering losses computed by sampling both types of neighbors. We then adapt this pipeline to GCD by utilizing the labelled images as ground truth neighbors.

However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. Our experiments show that MAT can effectively be applied to different VL models and tasks to improve adversarial robustness, outperforming previous efforts. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.</p></details> | Under review | None |

StochGradAdam optimizes by selectively sampling a subset of gradients during training, reducing the computational cost while preserving the advantages of adaptive learning rates and bias corrections found in Adam. Our experimental results, applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that StochGradAdam can achieve comparable or superior performance to Adam, even when using fewer gradient updates per iteration. By focusing on key gradient updates, StochGradAdam offers stable convergence and enhanced exploration of the loss landscape, while mitigating the impact of noisy gradients. The results suggest that this approach is particularly effective for large-scale models and datasets, providing a promising alternative to traditional optimization techniques for deep learning applications.</p></details> |  | None |

While there is a growing reliance on pre-trained models for classification tasks, these models often require extensive computational resources and may not perform optimally when transferred to new domains due to dataset variations. To address these challenges, this work adapts the neural edge histogram descriptors (NEHD) method originally developed for image classification, to classify passive sonar signals. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of statistical and structural texture features, demonstrating that their combination achieves competitive performance with large pre-trained models. The proposed NEHD-based approach offers a lightweight and efficient solution for underwater target recognition, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures.

Recent advances in classifiers with 3D volumetric object representations have demonstrated a greatly enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution data. However, these 3D-aware classifiers have not been studied from the perspective of interpretability. We introduce CAVE - Concept Aware Volumes for Explanations - a new direction that unifies interpretability and robustness in image classification. We design an inherently-interpretable and robust classifier by extending existing 3D-aware classifiers with concepts extracted from their volumetric representations for classification. In an array of quantitative metrics for interpretability, we compare against different concept-based approaches across the explainable AI literature and show that CAVE discovers well-grounded concepts that are used consistently across images, while achieving superior robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed mentor-student relationships, our framework dynamically selects and adapts the teaching strategies of diverse mentors based on their effectiveness for each data sample. ClassroomKD comprises two main modules: the Knowledge Filtering (KF) module and the Mentoring module. The KF Module dynamically ranks mentors based on their performance for each input, activating only high-quality mentors to minimize error accumulation and prevent information loss. The Mentoring Module adjusts the distillation strategy by tuning each mentor's influence according to the dynamic performance gap between the student and mentors, effectively modulating the learning pace. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and 2D human pose estimation (COCO Keypoints and MPII Human Pose) demonstrate that ClassroomKD outperforms existing knowledge distillation methods for different network architectures. Our results highlight that a dynamic and adaptive approach to mentor selection and guidance leads to more effective knowledge transfer, paving the way for enhanced model performance through distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IntelliSys 2025</p></details> | None |

However, as Defazio & Bottou (2019) highlight, its effectiveness in deep learning is yet to be proven. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of SVRG in optimizing real-world neural networks. Our empirical analysis finds that, for deeper neural networks, the strength of the variance reduction term in SVRG should be smaller and decrease as training progresses. Inspired by this, we introduce a multiplicative coefficient $\alpha$ to control the strength and adjust it through a linear decay schedule. We name our method $\alpha$-SVRG. Our results show $\alpha$-SVRG better optimizes models, consistently reducing training loss compared to the baseline and standard SVRG across various model architectures and multiple image classification datasets. We hope our findings encourage further exploration into variance reduction techniques in deep learning.

| **[Do Vision Models Develop Human-Like Progressive Difficulty Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13058v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a human undertakes a test, their responses likely follow a pattern: if they answered an easy question $(2 \times 3)$ incorrectly, they would likely answer a more difficult one $(2 \times 3 \times 4)$ incorrectly; and if they answered a difficult question correctly, they would likely answer the easy one correctly. Anything else hints at memorization. Do current visual recognition models exhibit a similarly structured learning capacity? In this work, we consider the task of image classification and study if those models' responses follow that pattern. Since real images aren't labeled with difficulty, we first create a dataset of 100 categories, 10 attributes, and 3 difficulty levels using recent generative models: for each category (e.g., dog) and attribute (e.g., occlusion), we generate images of increasing difficulty (e.g., a dog without occlusion, a dog only partly visible). We find that most of the models do in fact behave similarly to the aforementioned pattern around 80-90% of the time. Using this property, we then explore a new way to evaluate those models. Instead of testing the model on every possible test image, we create an adaptive test akin to GRE, in which the model's performance on the current round of images determines the test images in the next round. This allows the model to skip over questions too easy/hard for itself, and helps us get its overall performance in fewer steps.</p></details> |  | None |

Its impact spans across various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world problems present challenges in designing effective deep learning models. Consequently, several deep learning models have been developed to address different problems and applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Transformer, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN), Generative Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Deep Transfer Learning. We examine the structure, applications, benefits, and limitations of each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three publicly available datasets: IMDB, ARAS, and Fruit-360. We compared the performance of six renowned deep learning models: CNN, RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU alongside two newer models, TCN and Transformer, using the IMDB and ARAS datasets. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of eight CNN-based models, including VGG (Visual Geometry Group), Inception, ResNet (Residual Network), InceptionResNet, Xception (Extreme Inception), MobileNet, DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network), and NASNet (Neural Architecture Search Network), for image classification tasks using the Fruit-360 dataset.</p></details> | 62 pages, 37 figures | None |

However, black-box adversarial attacks can fool image classification models without access to model structure and weights. Recent studies have reported attack success rates of over 95% with fewer than 1,000 queries. Then the question arises: whether black-box attacks have become a real threat against cloud APIs? To shed some light on this, our research indicates that black-box attacks are not as effective against cloud APIs as proposed in research papers due to several common mistakes that overestimate the efficiency of black-box attacks. To avoid similar mistakes, we conduct black-box attacks directly on cloud APIs rather than local models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR Workshop, 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods calculate the similarity between visual embedding and learnable class embeddings, which are initialized by text embeddings, for zero-shot image classification. In this work, we first analyze this process based on Bayes theorem, and observe that the core factors influencing the final prediction are the likelihood and the prior. However, existing methods essentially focus on adapting class embeddings to adapt likelihood, but they often ignore the importance of prior. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach, \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{C}lass \textbf{A}daptation (BCA), which in addition to continuously updating class embeddings to adapt likelihood, also uses the posterior of incoming samples to continuously update the prior for each class embedding. This dual updating mechanism allows the model to better adapt to distribution shifts and achieve higher prediction accuracy. Our method not only surpasses existing approaches in terms of performance metrics but also maintains superior inference rates and memory usage, making it highly efficient and practical for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Conventional approaches are predominantly model-based, typically requiring retraining or fine-tuning the model's weights to meet unlearning requirements. In this work, we approach the MU problem from a novel input perturbation-based perspective, where the model weights remain intact throughout the unlearning process. We demonstrate the existence of a proactive input-based unlearning strategy, referred to forget vector, which can be generated as an input-agnostic data perturbation and remains as effective as model-based approximate unlearning approaches. We also explore forget vector arithmetic, whereby multiple class-specific forget vectors are combined through simple operations (e.g., linear combinations) to generate new forget vectors for unseen unlearning tasks, such as forgetting arbitrary subsets across classes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the forget vector, showcasing its competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art model-based methods.

Yet, conformal prediction is not reliable under poisoning attacks where adversaries manipulate both training and calibration data, which can significantly alter prediction sets in practice. As a solution, we propose reliable prediction sets (RPS): the first efficient method for constructing conformal prediction sets with provable reliability guarantees under poisoning. To ensure reliability under training poisoning, we introduce smoothed score functions that reliably aggregate predictions of classifiers trained on distinct partitions of the training data. To ensure reliability under calibration poisoning, we construct multiple prediction sets, each calibrated on distinct subsets of the calibration data. We then aggregate them into a majority prediction set, which includes a class only if it appears in a majority of the individual sets. Both proposed aggregations mitigate the influence of datapoints in the training and calibration data on the final prediction set. We experimentally validate our approach on image classification tasks, achieving strong reliability while maintaining utility and preserving coverage on clean data. Overall, our approach represents an important step towards more trustworthy uncertainty quantification in the presence of data poisoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | None |

In this specific case, the CLIP server provided by Jina AI is used for experimentation. The research hypothesizes that as the number of ground truth and artificially introduced semantically equivalent categories increases, the labeling accuracy of ViTs improves until a theoretical maximum or limit is reached. A wide variety of image datasets were chosen to test this hypothesis. These datasets were processed through a custom function in Python designed to evaluate the model's accuracy, with adjustments being made to account for format differences between datasets. By exponentially introducing new redundant categories, the experiment assessed accuracy trends until they plateaued, decreased, or fluctuated inconsistently. The findings show that while semantic scaling initially increases model performance, the benefits diminish or reverse after surpassing a critical threshold, providing insight into the limitations and possible optimization of category labeling strategies for ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 7 figures, submitted to CVPR (feedback pending)</p></details> | None |

It is challenging to timely prevent such model-stealing attacks to achieve strong protection and maintain utility. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric detector called Account-aware Distribution Discrepancy (ADD) to recognize queries from malicious users by leveraging account-wise local dependency. We formulate each class as a Multivariate Normal distribution (MVN) in the feature space and measure the malicious score as the sum of weighted class-wise distribution discrepancy. The ADD detector is combined with random-based prediction poisoning to yield a plug-and-play defense module named D-ADD for image classification models. Results of extensive experimental studies show that D-ADD achieves strong defense against different types of attacks with little interference in serving benign users for both soft and hard-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, published in AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Previous methods to measure shape and texture biases are typically style-transfer-based and limited to DNNs for image classification. In this work, we provide a new evaluation procedure consisting of 1) a cue-decomposition method that comprises two AI-free data pre-processing methods extracting shape and texture cues, respectively, and 2) a novel cue-decomposition shape bias evaluation metric that leverages the cue-decomposition data. For application purposes we introduce a corresponding cue-decomposition robustness metric that allows for the estimation of the robustness of a DNN w.r.t. image corruptions. In our numerical experiments, our findings for biases in image classification DNNs align with those of previous evaluation metrics. However, our cue-decomposition robustness metric shows superior results in terms of estimating the robustness of DNNs. Furthermore, our results for DNNs on the semantic segmentation datasets Cityscapes and ADE20k for the first time shed light into the biases of semantic segmentation DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these issues, we propose MExD, an Expert-Infused Diffusion Model that combines the strengths of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with a diffusion model for enhanced classification. MExD balances patch feature distribution through a novel MoE-based aggregator that selectively emphasizes relevant information, effectively filtering noise, addressing data imbalance, and extracting essential features. These features are then integrated via a diffusion-based generative process to directly yield the class distribution for the WSI. Moving beyond conventional discriminative approaches, MExD represents the first generative strategy in WSI classification, capturing fine-grained details for robust and precise results. Our MExD is validated on three widely-used benchmarks-Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and BRACS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in both binary and multi-class tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 | None |

Transformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to their quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently, Mamba introduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high parallelism, enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D sequences. However, extending Mamba to vision tasks, which inherently involve 2D structures, results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D sequence processing. On the other hand, current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D structures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack of efficient parallel algorithms. In this work, we propose 2DMamba, a novel 2D selective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images into Mamba, with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator, adopting both spatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of our approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that 2DMamba improves up to 2.48% in AUC, 3.11% in F1 score, 2.47% in accuracy and 5.52% in C-index. Additionally, integrating our method with VMamba for natural imaging yields 0.5 to 0.7 improvements in mIoU on the ADE20k semantic segmentation dataset, and 0.2% accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K classification dataset.

However, state-of-the-art methods often rely on fine-tuning techniques like prompt learning and adapter-based tuning to optimize CLIP's performance. The necessity for fine-tuning significantly limits CLIP's adaptability to novel datasets and domains. This requirement mandates substantial time and computational resources for each new dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce simple yet effective training-free approaches, Single-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (SLAC) and Two-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (TLAC), that leverages powerful Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini, for image classification. The proposed methods leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LMMs, allowing for seamless adaptation to diverse datasets and domains without the need for additional training. Our approaches involve prompting the LMM to identify objects within an image. Subsequently, the CLIP text encoder determines the image class by identifying the dataset class with the highest semantic similarity to the LLM predicted object. We evaluated our models on 11 base-to-novel datasets and they achieved superior accuracy on 9 of these, including benchmarks like ImageNet, SUN397 and Caltech101, while maintaining a strictly training-free paradigm. Our overall accuracy of 83.44% surpasses the previous state-of-the-art few-shot methods by a margin of 6.75%. Our method achieved 83.6% average accuracy across 13 datasets, a 9.7% improvement over the previous 73.9% state-of-the-art for training-free approaches.

The decoder subsequently processes these features to generate pixel-level predictions. However, due to structural differences and variations in input data, only encoders benefit from pre-learned representations from vision benchmarks such as image classification and self-supervised learning, while decoders are typically trained from scratch. In this paper, we introduce $\times$Net, which facilitates a "pre-trained encoder $\times$ pre-trained decoder" collaboration through three innovative designs. $\times$Net enables the direct utilization of pre-trained models within the decoder, integrating pre-learned representations into the decoding process to enhance performance in dense prediction tasks. By simply coupling the pre-trained encoder and pre-trained decoder, $\times$Net distinguishes itself as a highly promising approach. Remarkably, it achieves this without relying on decoding-specific structures or task-specific algorithms.

However, existing approaches still face the dilemma between global modeling and efficient computation. While the Selective State Space Model (SSM) can simulate long-range dependencies with linear complexity, it still encounters challenges in MIC, such as local pixel forgetting, channel redundancy, and lack of local perception. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet efficient vision backbone for MIC tasks, named MambaMIC. Specifically, we introduce a Local-Global dual-branch aggregation module: the MambaMIC Block, designed to effectively capture and fuse local connectivity and global dependencies. In the local branch, we use local convolutions to capture pixel similarity, mitigating local pixel forgetting and enhancing perception. In the global branch, SSM extracts global dependencies, while Locally Aware Enhanced Filter reduces channel redundancy and local pixel forgetting. Additionally, we design a Feature Modulation Interaction Aggregation Module for deep feature interaction and key feature re-localization.

In the commonly studied scenario of classification from compressed images, a key objective is to enable learning directly on entropy-coded data, thereby bypassing the computationally intensive step of data reconstruction. Conventional entropy-coding methods, such as Huffman and Arithmetic coding, are effective for compression but disrupt the data structure, making them less suitable for direct learning without decoding. This paper investigates the use of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes -- originally designed for channel coding -- as an alternative entropy-coding approach. It is hypothesized that the structured nature of LDPC codes can be leveraged more effectively by deep learning models for tasks like classification. At the receiver side, gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are trained to perform image classification directly on LDPC-coded data. Experiments on datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR show that LDPC codes outperform Huffman and Arithmetic coding in classification tasks, while requiring significantly smaller learning models. Furthermore, the paper analyzes why LDPC codes preserve data structure more effectively than traditional entropy-coding techniques and explores the impact of key code parameters on classification performance. These results suggest that LDPC-based entropy coding offers an optimal balance between learning efficiency and model complexity, eliminating the need for prior decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications (Under Review)</p></details> | None |

Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

Current paradigms predominantly rely on self-supervision within uni-modal image data, thereby neglecting the inter-modal correlations essential for effective learning of cross-modal image representations. This limitation is particularly significant for naturally grouped multi-modal data, e.g., multi-parametric MRI scans for a patient undergoing various functional imaging protocols in the same study. To bridge this gap, we conduct a novel multi-modal image pre-training with three proxy tasks to facilitate the learning of cross-modality representations and correlations using multi-modal brain MRI scans (over 2.4 million images in 16,022 scans of 3,755 patients), i.e., cross-modal image reconstruction, modality-aware contrastive learning, and modality template distillation. To demonstrate the generalizability of our pre-trained model, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks with ten downstream tasks. The superior performance of our method is reported in comparison to state-of-the-art pre-training methods, with Dice Score improvement of 0.28\%-14.47\% across six segmentation benchmarks and a consistent accuracy boost of 0.65\%-18.07\% in four individual image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Open-Set Plankton Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11318v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers open-set recognition (OSR) of plankton images. Plankton include a diverse range of microscopic aquatic organisms that have an important role in marine ecosystems as primary producers and as a base of food webs. Given their sensitivity to environmental changes, fluctuations in plankton populations offer valuable information about oceans' health and climate change motivating their monitoring. Modern automatic plankton imaging devices enable the collection of large-scale plankton image datasets, facilitating species-level analysis. Plankton species recognition can be seen as an image classification task and is typically solved using deep learning-based image recognition models. However, data collection in real aquatic environments results in imaging devices capturing a variety of non-plankton particles and plankton species not present in the training set. This creates a challenging fine-grained OSR problem, characterized by subtle differences between taxonomically close plankton species. We address this challenge by conducting extensive experiments on three OSR approaches using both phyto- and zooplankton images analyzing also on the effect of the rejection thresholds for OSR. The results demonstrate that high OSR accuracy can be obtained promoting the use of these methods in operational plankton research.

As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pap smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, Grand Challenge paper accepted at ISBI 2025</p></details> | None |

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> | Under Review | [Code Link](https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon) |

We argue for using Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) as the primary means of communicating DP guarantees in ML, with the full privacy profile as a secondary option in case GDP is too inaccurate. Unlike other widely used alternatives, GDP has only one parameter, which ensures easy comparability of guarantees, and it can accurately capture the full privacy profile of many important ML applications. To support our claims, we investigate the privacy profiles of state-of-the-art DP large-scale image classification, and the TopDown algorithm for the U.S. Decennial Census, observing that GDP fits the profiles remarkably well in all three cases. Although GDP is ideal for reporting the final guarantees, other formalisms (e.g., privacy loss random variables) are needed for accurate privacy accounting. We show that such intermediate representations can be efficiently converted to GDP with minimal loss in tightness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $50,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs to bridge the modalities given pre-trained unimodal encoders on ImageNet classification and misinformative news caption detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Interpretable Logic Rules from Deep Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10547v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general framework called VisionLogic to extract interpretable logic rules from deep vision models, with a focus on image classification tasks. Given any deep vision model that uses a fully connected layer as the output head, VisionLogic transforms neurons in the last layer into predicates and grounds them into vision concepts using causal validation. In this way, VisionLogic can provide local explanations for single images and global explanations for specific classes in the form of logic rules. Compared to existing interpretable visualization tools such as saliency maps, VisionLogic addresses several key challenges, including the lack of causal explanations, overconfidence in visualizations, and ambiguity in interpretation. VisionLogic also facilitates the study of visual concepts encoded by predicates, particularly how they behave under perturbation -- an area that remains underexplored in the field of hidden semantics. Apart from providing better visual explanations and insights into the visual concepts learned by the model, we show that VisionLogic retains most of the neural network's discriminative power in an interpretable and transparent manner. We envision it as a bridge between complex model behavior and human-understandable explanations, providing trustworthy and actionable insights for real-world applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as an effective approach for this problem. However, the effect of attention mechanism architecture on model performance is not well-documented for biomedical imagery. In this work, we compare different methods and implementations of MIL, including deep learning variants. We introduce a new method using higher-dimensional feature spaces for deep MIL. We also develop a novel algorithm for whole-slide image classification where extreme machine learning is combined with attention-based MIL to improve sensitivity and reduce training complexity. We apply our algorithms to the problem of detecting circulating rare cells (CRCs), such as erythroblasts, in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that nonlinearities play a key role in the classification, as removing them leads to a sharp decrease in stability in addition to a decrease in average area under the curve (AUC) of over 4%. We also demonstrate a considerable increase in robustness of the model with improvements of over 10% in average AUC when higher-dimensional feature spaces are leveraged. In addition, we show that extreme learning machines can offer clear improvements in terms of training efficiency by reducing the number of trained parameters by a factor of 5 whilst still maintaining the average AUC to within 1.5% of the deep MIL model. Finally, we discuss options of enriching the classical computing framework with quantum algorithms in the future. This work can thus help pave the way towards more accurate and efficient single-cell diagnostics, one of the building blocks of precision medicine.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Vision-Language Embeddings for Zero-Shot Learning in Histopathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10731v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot learning holds tremendous potential for histopathology image analysis by enabling models to generalize to unseen classes without extensive labeled data. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded the capabilities of ZSL, allowing models to perform tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, applying VLMs to histopathology presents considerable challenges due to the complexity of histopathological imagery and the nuanced nature of diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Resolution Prompt-guided Hybrid Embedding (MR-PHE) to address these challenges in zero-shot histopathology image classification. MR-PHE leverages multiresolution patch extraction to mimic the diagnostic workflow of pathologists, capturing both fine-grained cellular details and broader tissue structures critical for accurate diagnosis. We introduce a hybrid embedding strategy that integrates global image embeddings with weighted patch embeddings, effectively combining local and global contextual information. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive prompt generation and selection framework, enriching class descriptions with domain-specific synonyms and clinically relevant features to enhance semantic understanding. A similarity-based patch weighting mechanism assigns attention-like weights to patches based on their relevance to class embeddings, emphasizing diagnostically important regions during classification. Our approach utilizes pretrained VLM, CONCH for ZSL without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, offering scalability and reducing dependence on large annotated datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MR-PHE not only significantly improves zero-shot classification performance on histopathology datasets but also often surpasses fully supervised models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Multi-Modal Federated Learning Framework for Remote Sensing Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10262v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients) without sharing the local data of the clients. Most of the existing FL methods assume that the data distributed across all clients is associated with the same data modality. However, remote sensing (RS) images present in different clients can be associated with diverse data modalities. The joint use of the multi-modal RS data can significantly enhance classification performance. To effectively exploit decentralized and unshared multi-modal RS data, our paper introduces a novel multi-modal FL framework for RS image classification problems. The proposed framework comprises three modules: 1) multi-modal fusion (MF); 2) feature whitening (FW); and 3) mutual information maximization (MIM). The MF module employs iterative model averaging to facilitate learning without accessing multi-modal training data on clients. The FW module aims to address the limitations of training data heterogeneity by aligning data distributions across clients. The MIM module aims to model mutual information by maximizing the similarity between images from different modalities. For the experimental analyses, we focus our attention on multi-label classification and pixel-based classification tasks in RS. The results obtained using two benchmark archives show the effectiveness of the proposed framework when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. The code of the proposed framework will be available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/multi-modal-FL.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interpretable Image Classification via Non-parametric Part Prototype Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10247v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifying images with an interpretable decision-making process is a long-standing problem in computer vision. In recent years, Prototypical Part Networks has gained traction as an approach for self-explainable neural networks, due to their ability to mimic human visual reasoning by providing explanations based on prototypical object parts. However, the quality of the explanations generated by these methods leaves room for improvement, as the prototypes usually focus on repetitive and redundant concepts. Leveraging recent advances in prototype learning, we present a framework for part-based interpretable image classification that learns a set of semantically distinctive object parts for each class, and provides diverse and comprehensive explanations. The core of our method is to learn the part-prototypes in a non-parametric fashion, through clustering deep features extracted from foundation vision models that encode robust semantic information. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of explanations provided by ProtoPNets, we introduce Distinctiveness Score and Comprehensiveness Score. Through evaluation on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and Stanford Dogs datasets, we show that our framework compares favourably against existing ProtoPNets while achieving better interpretability.

Backpropagation (BP), the standard learning algorithm, relies on gradient descent and typically requires numerous iterations for convergence. In this study, we introduce Expectation Reflection (ER), a novel learning approach that updates weights multiplicatively based on the ratio of observed to predicted outputs. Unlike traditional methods, ER maintains consistency without requiring ad hoc loss functions or learning rate hyperparameters. We extend ER to multilayer networks and demonstrate its effectiveness in performing image classification tasks. Notably, ER achieves optimal weight updates in a single iteration. Additionally, we reinterpret ER as a modified form of gradient descent incorporating the inverse mapping of target propagation. These findings suggest that ER provides an efficient and scalable alternative for training neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do We Always Need the Simplicity Bias? Looking for Optimal Inductive Biases in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10065v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architectures tend to fit their data with relatively simple functions. This "simplicity bias" is widely regarded as key to their success. This paper explores the limits of this principle. Building on recent findings that the simplicity bias stems from ReLU activations [96], we introduce a method to meta-learn new activation functions and inductive biases better suited to specific tasks. Findings: We identify multiple tasks where the simplicity bias is inadequate and ReLUs suboptimal. In these cases, we learn new activation functions that perform better by inducing a prior of higher complexity. Interestingly, these cases correspond to domains where neural networks have historically struggled: tabular data, regression tasks, cases of shortcut learning, and algorithmic grokking tasks. In comparison, the simplicity bias induced by ReLUs proves adequate on image tasks where the best learned activations are nearly identical to ReLUs and GeLUs. Implications: Contrary to popular belief, the simplicity bias of ReLU networks is not universally useful. It is near-optimal for image classification, but other inductive biases are sometimes preferable. We showed that activation functions can control these inductive biases, but future tailored architectures might provide further benefits. Advances are still needed to characterize a model's inductive biases beyond "complexity", and their adequacy with the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-Guided Masking for Enhanced Vision Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10362v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel frequency-based Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach that significantly enhances its efficacy for pre-training. Prior work in this direction masks out pre-defined frequencies in the input image and employs a reconstruction loss to pre-train the model. While achieving promising results, such an implementation has two fundamental limitations as identified in our paper. First, using pre-defined frequencies overlooks the variability of image frequency responses. Second, pre-trained with frequency-filtered images, the resulting model needs relatively more data to adapt to naturally looking images during fine-tuning. To address these drawbacks, we propose FOurier transform compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), integrating two dedicated ideas. First, inspired by image compression, we adaptively select the masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses, creating more suitable SSL tasks for pre-training. Second, we employ a two-branch framework empowered by knowledge distillation, enabling the model to take both the filtered and original images as input, largely reducing the burden of downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLK in achieving competitive performance to many state-of-the-art SSL methods across various downstream tasks, including image classification, few-shot learning, and semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their theoretical promise, the robustness of KANs under adversarial conditions has yet to be thoroughly examined. In this paper we explore the adversarial robustness of KANs, with a particular focus on image classification tasks. We assess the performance of KANs against standard white box and black-box adversarial attacks, comparing their resilience to that of established neural network architectures. Our experimental evaluation encompasses a variety of standard image classification benchmark datasets and investigates both fully connected and convolutional neural network architectures, of three sizes: small, medium, and large. We conclude that small- and medium-sized KANs (either fully connected or convolutional) are not consistently more robust than their standard counterparts, but that large-sized KANs are, by and large, more robust. This comprehensive evaluation of KANs in adversarial scenarios offers the first in-depth analysis of KAN security, laying the groundwork for future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Fair Federated Medical Image Classification Against Quality Shift via Inter-Client Progressive State Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09587v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the potential of federated learning in medical applications, inconsistent imaging quality across institutions-stemming from lower-quality data from a minority of clients-biases federated models toward more common high-quality images. This raises significant fairness concerns. Existing fair federated learning methods have demonstrated some effectiveness in solving this problem by aligning a single 0th- or 1st-order state of convergence (e.g., training loss or sharpness). However, we argue in this work that fairness based on such a single state is still not an adequate surrogate for fairness during testing, as these single metrics fail to fully capture the convergence characteristics, making them suboptimal for guiding fair learning. To address this limitation, we develop a generalized framework. Specifically, we propose assessing convergence using multiple states, defined as sharpness or perturbed loss computed at varying search distances. Building on this comprehensive assessment, we propose promoting fairness for these states across clients to achieve our ultimate fairness objective. This is accomplished through the proposed method, FedISM+. In FedISM+, the search distance evolves over time, progressively focusing on different states. We then incorporate two components in local training and global aggregation to ensure cross-client fairness for each state. This gradually makes convergence equitable for all states, thereby improving fairness during testing. Our empirical evaluations, performed on the well-known RSNA ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of FedISM+ over existing state-of-the-art methods for fair federated learning.

However, its complex architecture and advantages over dense models in image classification remain unclear. In previous studies, MoE performance has often been affected by noise and outliers in the input space. Some approaches incorporate input clustering for training MoE models, but most clustering algorithms lack access to labeled data, limiting their effectiveness. This paper introduces the Double-stage Feature-level Clustering and Pseudo-labeling-based Mixture of Experts (DFCP-MoE) framework, which consists of input feature extraction, feature-level clustering, and a computationally efficient pseudo-labeling strategy. This approach reduces the impact of noise and outliers while leveraging a small subset of labeled data to label a large portion of unlabeled inputs. We propose a conditional end-to-end joint training method that improves expert specialization by training the MoE model on well-labeled, clustered inputs. Unlike traditional MoE and dense models, the DFCP-MoE framework effectively captures input space diversity, leading to competitive inference results. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets for multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 1 Figure, and 3 Tables</p></details> | None |

However, they often require large amounts of data and can exhibit biases that limit their robustness and generalizability. This paper introduces ForAug, a novel data augmentation scheme that addresses these challenges and explicitly includes inductive biases, which commonly are part of the neural network architecture, into the training data. ForAug is constructed by using pretrained foundation models to separate and recombine foreground objects with different backgrounds, enabling fine-grained control over image composition during training. It thus increases the data diversity and effective number of training samples. We demonstrate that training on ForNet, the application of ForAug to ImageNet, significantly improves the accuracy of ViTs and other architectures by up to 4.5 percentage points (p.p.) on ImageNet and 7.3 p.p. on downstream tasks. Importantly, ForAug enables novel ways of analyzing model behavior and quantifying biases. Namely, we introduce metrics for background robustness, foreground focus, center bias, and size bias and show that training on ForNet substantially reduces these biases compared to training on ImageNet. In summary, ForAug provides a valuable tool for analyzing and mitigating biases, enabling the development of more robust and reliable computer vision models.

Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) exploit it to obtain confidential information about the data used for training, aiming to steal information. They can be repurposed as a measurement of data integrity by inferring whether it was used to train a machine learning model. While state-of-the-art attacks achieve a significant privacy leakage, their requirements are not feasible enough, hindering their role as practical tools to assess the magnitude of the privacy risk. Moreover, the most appropriate evaluation metric of MIA, the True Positive Rate at low False Positive Rate lacks interpretability. We claim that the incorporation of Few-Shot Learning techniques to the MIA field and a proper qualitative and quantitative privacy evaluation measure should deal with these issues. In this context, our proposal is twofold. We propose a Few-Shot learning based MIA, coined as the FeS-MIA model, which eases the evaluation of the privacy breach of a deep learning model by significantly reducing the number of resources required for the purpose. Furthermore, we propose an interpretable quantitative and qualitative measure of privacy, referred to as Log-MIA measure. Jointly, these proposals provide new tools to assess the privacy leakage and to ease the evaluation of the training data integrity of deep learning models, that is, to analyze the privacy breach of a deep learning model. Experiments carried out with MIA over image classification and language modeling tasks and its comparison to the state-of-the-art show that our proposals excel at reporting the privacy leakage of a deep learning model with little extra information.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we analyze a dataset of climate change-related tweets from X (formerly Twitter) shared in 2019, containing 730k tweets along with the shared images. Our approach integrates statistical analysis, image classification, object detection, and sentiment analysis to explore visual narratives in climate discourse. Additionally, we introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate interactive data exploration. Our findings reveal key themes in climate communication, highlight sentiment divergence between images and text, and underscore the strengths and limitations of foundation models in analyzing social media imagery.

While VRD research is dependent on increasingly sophisticated and cumbersome models, the field has neglected to study efficiency via model compression. Here, we design a KD experimentation methodology for more lean, performant models on document understanding (DU) tasks that are integral within larger task pipelines. We carefully selected KD strategies (response-based, feature-based) for distilling knowledge to and from backbones with different architectures (ResNet, ViT, DiT) and capacities (base, small, tiny). We study what affects the teacher-student knowledge gap and find that some methods (tuned vanilla KD, MSE, SimKD with an apt projector) can consistently outperform supervised student training. Furthermore, we design downstream task setups to evaluate covariate shift and the robustness of distilled DLA models on zero-shot layout-aware document visual question answering (DocVQA). DLA-KD experiments result in a large mAP knowledge gap, which unpredictably translates to downstream robustness, accentuating the need to further explore how to efficiently obtain more semantic document layout awareness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICDAR 2024 (Athens, Greece)</p></details> | None |

However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL. This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model. Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists. This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning. Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration. Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them. Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN). Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics.</p></details> | summited to ICCV2025 | None |

Their performances largely depend on the prompt quality. While recent methods show that visual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) enhance the generalization of VLMs, class-specific prompts may be inaccurate or lack discrimination due to the hallucination in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to find visually discriminative prompts for fine-grained categories with minimal supervision and no human-in-the-loop. An evolution-based algorithm is proposed to progressively optimize language prompts from task-specific templates to class-specific descriptions. Unlike optimizing templates, the search space shows an explosion in class-specific candidate prompts. This increases prompt generation costs, iterative times, and the overfitting problem. To this end, we first introduce several simple yet effective edit-based and evolution-based operations to generate diverse candidate prompts by one-time query of LLMs. Then, two sampling strategies are proposed to find a better initial search point and reduce traversed categories, saving iteration costs. Moreover, we apply a novel fitness score with entropy constraints to mitigate overfitting. In a challenging one-shot image classification setting, our method outperforms existing textual prompt-based methods and improves LLM-generated description methods across 13 datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our optimal prompts improve adapter-based methods and transfer effectively across different backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> | None |

Instance-level examinations, such as attribution techniques, are commonly employed to interpret the model decisions. However, when interpreting misclassified decisions, human intervention may be required. Analyzing the attribu tions across each class within one instance can be particularly labor intensive and influenced by the bias of the human interpreter. In this paper, we present a novel framework to uncover the weakness of the classifier via counterfactual examples. A prober is introduced to learn the correctness of the classifier's decision in terms of binary code-hit or miss. It enables the creation of the counterfactual example concerning the prober's decision. We test the performance of our prober's misclassification detection and verify its effectiveness on the image classification benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by generating counterfactuals that penetrate the prober, we demonstrate that our framework effectively identifies vulnerabilities in the target classifier without relying on label information on the MNIST dataset.</p></details> | ICPRAI 2024 | None |

While prior research has attempted to demystify these models through input attribution and neuron role analysis, there's been a notable gap in considering layer-level information and the holistic path of information flow across layers. In this paper, we investigate the significance of influential neuron paths within vision Transformers, which is a path of neurons from the model input to output that impacts the model inference most significantly. We first propose a joint influence measure to assess the contribution of a set of neurons to the model outcome. And we further provide a layer-progressive neuron locating approach that efficiently selects the most influential neuron at each layer trying to discover the crucial neuron path from input to output within the target model. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method finding the most influential neuron path along which the information flows, over the existing baseline solutions. Additionally, the neuron paths have illustrated that vision Transformers exhibit some specific inner working mechanism for processing the visual information within the same image category. We further analyze the key effects of these neurons on the image classification task, showcasing that the found neuron paths have already preserved the model capability on downstream tasks, which may also shed some lights on real-world applications like model pruning.

However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images, typically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts, and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in generalizability. Meanwhile, explorations in prompt learning for biomedical image analysis are still highly limited. In this work, we propose BiomedCoOp, a novel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP for accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification. Our approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic consistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We conducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical datasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.

| **[Measuring directional bias amplification in image captions using predictability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07878v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases but can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</p></details> |  | None |

Such architectures require large data sets and rely on convolution and self-attention operations. In 2021, MLP-Mixer emerged, an architecture that relies only on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and achieves extremely competitive results when compared to CNNs and ViTs. Despite its good performance in computer vision tasks, the MLP-Mixer architecture may not be suitable for refined feature extraction in images. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was proposed as a promising alternative to MLP models. KANs promise to improve accuracy and interpretability when compared to MLPs. Therefore, the present work aims to design a new mixer-based architecture, called KAN-Mixers, using KANs as main layers and evaluate its performance, in terms of several performance metrics, in the image classification task. As main results obtained, the KAN-Mixers model was superior to the MLP, MLP-Mixer and KAN models in the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with 0.9030 and 0.6980 of average accuracy, respectively.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

This paper presents an overview of generalizable and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging, aimed at addressing the urgent need for transparency and explainability in clinical applications. Methodology. We propose to use four CNNs in three medical datasets (brain tumor, skin cancer, and chest x-ray) for medical image classification tasks. In addition, we perform paired t-tests to show the significance of the differences observed between different methods. Furthermore, we propose to combine ResNet50 with five common XAI techniques to obtain explainable results for model prediction, aiming at improving model transparency. We also involve a quantitative metric (confidence increase) to evaluate the usefulness of XAI techniques. Key findings. The experimental results indicate that ResNet50 can achieve feasible accuracy and F1 score in all datasets (e.g., 86.31\% accuracy in skin cancer). Furthermore, the findings show that while certain XAI methods, such as XgradCAM, effectively highlight relevant abnormal regions in medical images, others, like EigenGradCAM, may perform less effectively in specific scenarios. In addition, XgradCAM indicates higher confidence increase (e.g., 0.12 in glioma tumor) compared to GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08). Implications. Based on the experimental results and recent advancements, we outline future research directions to enhance the robustness and generalizability of DL models in the field of biomedical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering</p></details> | None |

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

The explanations given by integrated gradients depend on a choice of base-point. The choice of base-point is not a priori obvious and can lead to drastically different explanations. There is a longstanding hypothesis that data lies on a low dimensional Riemannian manifold. The quality of explanations on a manifold can be measured by the extent to which an explanation for a point lies in its tangent space. In this work, we propose that the base-point should be chosen such that it maximises the tangential alignment of the explanation. We formalise the notion of tangential alignment and provide theoretical conditions under which a base-point choice will provide explanations lying in the tangent space. We demonstrate how to approximate the optimal base-point on several well-known image classification datasets. Furthermore, we compare the optimal base-point choice with common base-points and three gradient explainability models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the 32nd Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science</p></details> | None |

However, the high dimensionality and spectral variability of HSI data pose significant challenges for feature extraction and classification. This paper presents EnergyFormer, a transformer-based framework designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) Multi-Head Energy Attention (MHEA), which optimizes an energy function to selectively enhance critical spectral-spatial features, improving feature discrimination; (2) Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which adaptively encodes spectral and spatial dependencies to reinforce long-range interactions; and (3) Enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module (ECBAM), which selectively amplifies informative wavelength bands and spatial structures, enhancing representation learning. Extensive experiments on the WHU-Hi-HanChuan, Salinas, and Pavia University datasets demonstrate that EnergyFormer achieves exceptional overall accuracies of 99.28\%, 98.63\%, and 98.72\%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN, transformer, and Mamba-based models.

| **[Towards Million-Scale Adversarial Robustness Evaluation With Stronger Individual Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15210v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

As more nodes participate in a round of FL, the effectiveness of individual model updates by nodes also diminishes. In this study, we increase the effectiveness of client updates by dividing the network into smaller partitions, or cohorts. We introduce Cohort-Parallel Federated Learning (CPFL): a novel learning approach where each cohort independently trains a global model using FL, until convergence, and the produced models by each cohort are then unified using knowledge distillation. The insight behind CPFL is that smaller, isolated networks converge quicker than in a one-network setting where all nodes participate. Through exhaustive experiments involving realistic traces and non-IID data distributions on the CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST image classification tasks, we investigate the balance between the number of cohorts, model accuracy, training time, and compute resources. Compared to traditional FL, CPFL with four cohorts, non-IID data distribution, and CIFAR-10 yields a 1.9x reduction in train time and a 1.3x reduction in resource usage, with a minimal drop in test accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of EuroMLSys'25</p></details> | None |

We introduce SIC, an inherently interpretable neural network that provides local and global explanations of its decision-making process. Leveraging the concept of case-based reasoning, SIC extracts class-representative support vectors from training images, ensuring they capture relevant features while suppressing irrelevant ones. Classification decisions are made by calculating and aggregating similarity scores between these support vectors and the input's latent feature vector. We employ B-Cos transformations, which align model weights with inputs, to yield coherent pixel-level explanations in addition to global explanations of case-based reasoning. We evaluate SIC on three tasks: fine-grained classification on Stanford Dogs and FunnyBirds, multi-label classification on Pascal VOC, and pathology detection on the RSNA dataset. Results indicate that SIC not only achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art black-box and inherently interpretable models but also offers insightful explanations verified through practical evaluation on the FunnyBirds benchmark. Our theoretical analysis proves that these explanations fulfill established axioms for explanations. Our findings underscore SIC's potential for applications where understanding model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.</p></details> |  | None |

Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by employing the diagonal matrix preconditioning of the stochastic gradient during the training. Despite their widespread, second-order optimization algorithms exhibit superior convergence properties compared to their first-order counterparts e.g. Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited due to increased per-iteration computations compared to the first-order methods. We present \emph{AdaFisher}--an adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a \emph{diagonal block-Kronecker} approximation of the Fisher information matrix for adaptive gradient preconditioning. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between enhanced \emph{convergence/generalization} capabilities and computational efficiency in second-order optimization framework for training DNNs. Despite the slow pace of second-order optimizers, we showcase that AdaFisher can be reliably adopted for image classification, language modeling and stands out for its stability and robustness in hyper-parameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher \textbf{outperforms the SOTA optimizers} in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed.

In this work, we exploit an overlooked property of adversarial perturbations--their dependence on image transforms--and introduce transform-dependent adversarial attacks. Unlike traditional attacks, our perturbations exhibit metamorphic properties, enabling diverse adversarial effects as a function of transformation parameters. We demonstrate that this transform-dependent vulnerability exists across different architectures (e.g., CNN and transformer), vision tasks (e.g., image classification and object detection), and a wide range of image transforms. Additionally, we show that transform-dependent perturbations can serve as a defense mechanism, preventing sensitive information disclosure when image enhancement transforms pose a risk of revealing private content. Through analysis in blackbox and defended model settings, we show that transform-dependent perturbations achieve high targeted attack success rates, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer attacks by 17-31% in blackbox scenarios. Our work introduces novel, controllable paradigm for adversarial attack deployment, revealing a previously overlooked vulnerability in deep networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Keeping Representation Similarity in Finetuning for Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07399v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale natural images have been widely used to adapt to medical image analysis through finetuning. This is largely attributed to pretrained representations capturing universal, robust, and generalizable features, which can be reutilized by downstream tasks. However, these representations are later found to gradually vanish during finetuning, accompanied by a degradation of foundation model's original abilities, e.g., generalizability. In this paper, we argue that pretrained representations can be well preserved while still effectively adapting to downstream tasks. We study this by proposing a new finetuning method RepSim, which minimizes the distance between pretrained and finetuned representations via constraining learnable orthogonal manifold based on similarity invariance. Compared to standard finetuning methods, e.g., full finetuning, our method improves representation similarity by over 30% while maintaining competitive accuracy, and reduces sharpness by 42% across five medical image classification datasets.

Existing methods aim to tackle this problem by locating and aligning relevant local features. However, the high intra-class variability in real-world images poses significant challenges in locating semantically relevant local regions under few-shot settings. Drawing inspiration from the human's complementary learning system, which excels at rapidly capturing and integrating semantic features from limited examples, we propose the generalization-optimized Systems Consolidation Adaptive Memory Dual-Network, SCAM-Net. This approach simulates the systems consolidation of complementary learning system with an adaptive memory module, which successfully addresses the difficulty of identifying meaningful features in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, we construct a Hippocampus-Neocortex dual-network that consolidates structured representation of each category, the structured representation is then stored and adaptively regulated following the generalization optimization principle in a long-term memory inside Neocortex. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

This hybrid approach aims to achieve superior performance, with significantly reduced model complexity as a result of the enriched feature representation, requiring fewer parameters. This paper proposes a novel QViT model for biomedical image classification and investigates its performance against comparable ViTs across eight diverse datasets, encompassing various modalities and classification tasks. We assess models trained from scratch and those pre-trained using knowledge distillation (KD) from high-quality teacher models. Our findings demonstrate that QViTs outperform comparable ViTs with average ROC AUC (0.863 vs 0.846) and accuracy (0.710 vs 0.687) when trained from scratch, and even compete with state-of-the-art classical models in multiple tasks, whilst being significantly more efficient (89% reduction in GFLOPs and 99.99% in parameter number). Additionally, we find that QViTs and ViTs respond equally well to KD, with QViT pre-training performance scaling with model complexity. This is the first investigation into the efficacy of deploying QViTs with KD for computer-aided diagnosis.

Current applications often fail to accurately infer and handle new relations or entities involving unseen categories, severely limiting their scalability and practicality in open-domain scenarios. ZL learning faces the challenge of effectively transferring semantic information of unseen categories in multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) embedding representation learning. In this paper, we propose ZSLLM, a framework for zero-shot embedding learning of MMKGs using large language models (LLMs). We leverage textual modality information of unseen categories as prompts to fully utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling semantic information transfer across different modalities for unseen categories. Through model-based learning, the embedding representation of unseen categories in MMKG is enhanced. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we take the first step towards bridging this gap by theoretically analyzing the learning dynamics of LoRA for matrix factorization (MF) under gradient flow (GF), emphasizing the crucial role of initialization. For small initialization, we theoretically show that GF converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with smaller initialization leading to lower final error. Our analysis shows that the final error is affected by the misalignment between the singular spaces of the pre-trained model and the target matrix, and reducing the initialization scale improves alignment. To address this misalignment, we propose a spectral initialization for LoRA in MF and theoretically prove that GF with small spectral initialization converges to the fine-tuning task with arbitrary precision. Numerical experiments from MF and image classification validate our findings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, storing multiple task-specific checkpoints requires significant memory, limiting scalability and restricting model merging to larger models and diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose quantizing task vectors (i.e., the difference between pre-trained and fine-tuned checkpoints) instead of quantizing fine-tuned checkpoints. We observe that task vectors exhibit a narrow weight range, enabling low precision quantization (up to 4 bit) within existing task vector merging frameworks. To further mitigate quantization errors within ultra-low bit precision (e.g., 2 bit), we introduce Residual Task Vector Quantization, which decomposes the task vector into a base vector and offset component. We allocate bits based on quantization sensitivity, ensuring precision while minimizing error within a memory budget. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction show our method maintains or improves model merging performance while using only 8% of the memory required for full-precision checkpoints.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies reveal that documents from encyclopedias provide helpful auxiliary information. However, existing methods align noisy documents, entangled in visual and non-visual descriptions, with image regions, yet solely depend on implicit learning. These models fail to filter non-visual noise reliably and incorrectly align non-visual words to image regions, which is harmful to knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel multi-attribute document supervision framework to remove noises at both document collection and model learning stages. With the help of large language models, we introduce a novel prompt algorithm that automatically removes non-visual descriptions and enriches less-described documents in multiple attribute views. Our proposed model, MADS, extracts multi-view transferable knowledge with information decoupling and semantic interactions for semantic alignment at local and global levels. Besides, we introduce a model-agnostic focus loss to explicitly enhance attention to visually discriminative information during training, also improving existing methods without additional parameters. With comparable computation costs, MADS consistently outperforms the SOTA by 7.2% and 8.2% on average in three benchmarks for document-based ZSL and GZSL settings, respectively. Moreover, we qualitatively offer interpretable predictions from multiple attribute views.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the widespread use of these pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there remains a gap in understanding the performance of various resource-efficient backbones across diverse domains and dataset sizes. Our study systematically evaluates multiple lightweight, pre-trained CNN backbones under consistent training settings across a variety of datasets, including natural images, medical images, galaxy images, and remote sensing images. This comprehensive analysis aims to aid machine learning practitioners in selecting the most suitable backbone for their specific problem, especially in scenarios involving small datasets where fine-tuning a pre-trained network is crucial. Even though attention-based architectures are gaining popularity, we observed that they tend to perform poorly under low data finetuning tasks compared to CNNs. We also observed that some CNN architectures such as ConvNeXt, RegNet and EfficientNet performs well compared to others on a diverse set of domains consistently.

Traditional clustering algorithms often suffer from inefficient memory utilization during computation, necessitating the loading of all data samples into memory, which becomes impractical for large-scale datasets. While variants such as Mini-Batch K-Means partially mitigate this issue by reducing memory usage, they lack robust theoretical convergence guarantees due to the non-convex nature of clustering problems. In contrast, the Stochastic Quantization algorithm provides strong theoretical convergence guarantees, making it a robust alternative for clustering tasks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and rapid convergence of the algorithm on an image classification problem with partially labeled data, comparing model accuracy across various ratios of labeled to unlabeled data. To address the challenge of high dimensionality, we employ a Triplet Network to encode images into low-dimensional representations in a latent space, which serve as a basis for comparing the efficiency of both the Stochastic Quantization algorithm and traditional quantization algorithms. Furthermore, we enhance the algorithm's convergence speed by introducing modifications with an adaptive learning rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, published in the International Scientific Technical Journal "Problems of Control and Informatics"</p></details> | None |
| **[Conformal Structured Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06296v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a promising strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of a predictive model; these algorithms modify the model to output sets of labels that are guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. However, existing conformal prediction algorithms have largely targeted classification and regression settings, where the structure of the prediction set has a simple form as a level set of the scoring function. However, for complex structured outputs such as text generation, these prediction sets might include a large number of labels and therefore be hard for users to interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework for conformal prediction in the structured prediction setting, that modifies existing conformal prediction algorithms to output structured prediction sets that implicitly represent sets of labels. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be applied in domains where the prediction sets can be represented as a set of nodes in a directed acyclic graph; for instance, for hierarchical labels such as image classification, a prediction set might be a small subset of coarse labels implicitly representing the prediction set of all their more fine-descendants. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to construct prediction sets that satisfy a desired coverage guarantee in several domains.</p></details> | 21 pages, 26 figures | None |

However, due to a lack of consideration for modal consistency, existing multi-modal fusion methods in the field of remote sensing still face challenges of incomplete semantic information and low computational efficiency in their fusion designs. Inspired by the observation that the visual language pre-training model CLIP can effectively extract strong semantic information from visual features, we propose M$^3$amba, a novel end-to-end CLIP-driven Mamba model for multi-modal fusion to address these challenges. Specifically, we introduce CLIP-driven modality-specific adapters in the fusion architecture to avoid the bias of understanding specific domains caused by direct inference, making the original CLIP encoder modality-specific perception. This unified framework enables minimal training to achieve a comprehensive semantic understanding of different modalities, thereby guiding cross-modal feature fusion. To further enhance the consistent association between modality mappings, a multi-modal Mamba fusion architecture with linear complexity and a cross-attention module Cross-SS2D are designed, which fully considers effective and efficient information interaction to achieve complete fusion. Extensive experiments have shown that M$^3$amba has an average performance improvement of at least 5.98\% compared with the state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal hyperspectral image classification tasks in the remote sensing field, while also demonstrating excellent training efficiency, achieving a double improvement in accuracy and efficiency.

Enhancing Zero-Shot Image Classification with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15668v3)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The central aim of this study is to enhance feature extraction and classification performance by utilizing multiscale object-based image analysis (OBIA). Traditional pixel-based methods often suffer from low accuracy and speckle noise, while single-scale OBIA approaches may overlook crucial information of image objects at different levels of detail. MOB-GCN addresses this issue by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales to improve classification results using the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that can model fine-grained and global spatial patterns. By constructing a dynamic multiscale graph hierarchy, MOB-GCN offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate details and global context of HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that MOB-GCN consistently outperforms single-scale graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise reduction, particularly when labeled data is limited. The implementation of MOB-GCN is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI) |
| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Minion Gated Recurrent Unit for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06175v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for continual learning in sequential data processing has led to progressively complex training methodologies and larger recurrent network architectures. Consequently, this has widened the knowledge gap between continual learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their ability to operate on devices with limited memory and compute. To address this challenge, we investigate the effectiveness of simplifying RNN architectures, particularly gated recurrent unit (GRU), and its impact on both single-task and multitask sequential learning. We propose a new variant of GRU, namely the minion recurrent unit (MiRU). MiRU replaces conventional gating mechanisms with scaling coefficients to regulate dynamic updates of hidden states and historical context, reducing computational costs and memory requirements. Despite its simplified architecture, MiRU maintains performance comparable to the standard GRU while achieving 2.90x faster training and reducing parameter usage by 2.88x, as demonstrated through evaluations on sequential image classification and natural language processing benchmarks. The impact of model simplification on its learning capacity is also investigated by performing continual learning tasks with a rehearsal-based strategy and global inhibition. We find that MiRU demonstrates stable performance in multitask learning even when using only rehearsal, unlike the standard GRU and its variants. These features position MiRU as a promising candidate for edge-device applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature-EndoGaussian: Feature Distilled Gaussian Splatting in Surgical Deformable Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06161v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has transformed clinical practice by reducing recovery times, minimizing complications, and enhancing precision. Nonetheless, MIS inherently relies on indirect visualization and precise instrument control, posing unique challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled real-time surgical scene understanding through techniques such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, with scene reconstruction emerging as a key element for enhanced intraoperative guidance. Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have been explored for this purpose, their substantial data requirements and slow rendering inhibit real-time performance. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a more efficient alternative, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic surgical scene reconstruction. In this work, we introduce Feature-EndoGaussian (FEG), an extension of 3DGS that integrates 2D segmentation cues into 3D rendering to enable real-time semantic and scene reconstruction. By leveraging pretrained segmentation foundation models, FEG incorporates semantic feature distillation within the Gaussian deformation framework, thereby enhancing both reconstruction fidelity and segmentation accuracy. On the EndoNeRF dataset, FEG achieves superior performance (SSIM of 0.97, PSNR of 39.08, and LPIPS of 0.03) compared to leading methods. Additionally, on the EndoVis18 dataset, FEG demonstrates competitive class-wise segmentation metrics while balancing model size and real-time performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Multi-perspective Contrastive Logit Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10693v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In previous studies on knowledge distillation, the significance of logit distillation has frequently been overlooked. To revitalize logit distillation, we present a novel perspective by reconsidering its computation based on the semantic properties of logits and exploring how to utilize it more efficiently. Logits often contain a substantial amount of high-level semantic information; however, the conventional approach of employing logits to compute Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence does not account for their semantic properties. Furthermore, this direct KL divergence computation fails to fully exploit the potential of logits. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel and efficient logit distillation method, Multi-perspective Contrastive Logit Distillation (MCLD), which substantially improves the performance and efficacy of logit distillation. In comparison to existing logit distillation methods and complex feature distillation methods, MCLD attains state-of-the-art performance in image classification, and transfer learning tasks across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, and STL-10. Additionally, MCLD exhibits superior training efficiency and outstanding performance with distilling on Vision Transformers, further emphasizing its notable advantages. This study unveils the vast potential of logits in knowledge distillation and seeks to offer valuable insights for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 9 tabels, 12 formulas</p></details> | None |
| **[AF-KAN: Activation Function-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06112v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have inspired numerous works exploring their applications across a wide range of scientific problems, with the potential to replace Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). While many KANs are designed using basis and polynomial functions, such as B-splines, ReLU-KAN utilizes a combination of ReLU functions to mimic the structure of B-splines and take advantage of ReLU's speed. However, ReLU-KAN is not built for multiple inputs, and its limitations stem from ReLU's handling of negative values, which can restrict feature extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Activation Function-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (AF-KAN), expanding ReLU-KAN with various activations and their function combinations. This novel KAN also incorporates parameter reduction methods, primarily attention mechanisms and data normalization, to enhance performance on image classification datasets. We explore different activation functions, function combinations, grid sizes, and spline orders to validate the effectiveness of AF-KAN and determine its optimal configuration. In the experiments, AF-KAN significantly outperforms MLP, ReLU-KAN, and other KANs with the same parameter count. It also remains competitive even when using fewer than 6 to 10 times the parameters while maintaining the same network structure. However, AF-KAN requires a longer training time and consumes more FLOPs.

| **[Disrupting Model Merging: A Parameter-Level Defense Without Sacrificing Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07661v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging is a technique that combines multiple finetuned models into a single model without additional training, allowing a free-rider to cheaply inherit specialized capabilities. This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Transformer Meets Twicing: Harnessing Unattended Residual Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00687v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous language and vision tasks. While the self-attention mechanism, a core component of transformers, has proven capable of handling complex data patterns, it has been observed that the representational capacity of the attention matrix degrades significantly across transformer layers, thereby hurting its overall performance. In this work, we leverage the connection between self-attention computations and low-pass non-local means (NLM) smoothing filters and propose the Twicing Attention, a novel attention mechanism that uses kernel twicing procedure in nonparametric regression to alleviate the low-pass behavior of associated NLM smoothing with compelling theoretical guarantees and enhanced adversarial robustness. This approach enables the extraction and reuse of meaningful information retained in the residuals following the imperfect smoothing operation at each layer. Our proposed method offers two key advantages over standard self-attention: 1) a provably slower decay of representational capacity and 2) improved robustness and accuracy across various data modalities and tasks. We empirically demonstrate the performance gains of our model over baseline transformers on multiple tasks and benchmarks, including image classification and language modeling, on both clean and corrupted data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages in the main text.

| **[Data-Free Black-Box Federated Learning via Zeroth-Order Gradient Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06028v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a global model under the orchestration of a central server without exposing their individual data. However, the iterative exchange of model parameters between the server and clients imposes heavy communication burdens, risks potential privacy leakage, and even precludes collaboration among heterogeneous clients. Distillation-based FL tackles these challenges by exchanging low-dimensional model outputs rather than model parameters, yet it highly relies on a task-relevant auxiliary dataset that is often not available in practice. Data-free FL attempts to overcome this limitation by training a server-side generator to directly synthesize task-specific data samples for knowledge transfer. However, the update rule of the generator requires clients to share on-device models for white-box access, which greatly compromises the advantages of distillation-based FL. This motivates us to explore a data-free and black-box FL framework via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation (FedZGE), which estimates the gradients after flowing through on-device models in a black-box optimization manner to complete the training of the generator in terms of fidelity, transferability, diversity, and equilibrium, without involving any auxiliary data or sharing any model parameters, thus combining the advantages of both distillation-based FL and data-free FL. Experiments on large-scale image classification datasets and network architectures demonstrate the superiority of FedZGE in terms of data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ComFe: An Interpretable Head for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04125v5)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable computer vision models explain their classifications through comparing the distances between the local embeddings of an image and a set of prototypes that represent the training data. However, these approaches introduce additional hyper-parameters that need to be tuned to apply to new datasets, scale poorly, and are more computationally intensive to train in comparison to black-box approaches. In this work, we introduce Component Features (ComFe), a highly scalable interpretable-by-design image classification head for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) that can obtain competitive performance in comparison to comparable non-interpretable methods. ComFe is the first interpretable head, that we know of, and unlike other interpretable approaches, can be readily applied to large scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K. Additionally, ComFe provides improved robustness and outperforms previous interpretable approaches on key benchmark datasets$\unicode{x2013}$using a consistent set of hyper-parameters and without finetuning the pretrained ViT backbone. With only global image labels and no segmentation or part annotations, ComFe can identify consistent component features within an image and determine which of these features are informative in making a prediction.

| **[A Mixture of Exemplars Approach for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17093v5)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the early weaknesses identified in deep neural networks trained for image classification tasks was their inability to provide low confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that was significantly different from the in-distribution (ID) data used to train them. Representation learning, where neural networks are trained in specific ways that improve their ability to detect OOD examples, has emerged as a promising solution. However, these approaches require long training times and can add additional overhead to detect OOD examples. Recent developments in Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models$\unicode{x2013}$large networks trained on large and diverse datasets with self-supervised approaches$\unicode{x2013}$also show strong performance in OOD detection, and could address these challenges. This paper presents Mixture of Exemplars (MoLAR), an efficient approach to tackling OOD detection challenges that is designed to maximise the benefit of training a classifier with a high quality, frozen, pretrained foundation model backbone. MoLAR provides strong OOD performance when only comparing the similarity of OOD examples to the exemplars, a small set of images chosen to be representative of the dataset, leading to up to 30 times faster OOD detection inference over other methods that provide best performance when the full ID dataset is used. In some cases, only using these exemplars actually improves performance with MoLAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved OOD detection performance of MoLAR in comparison to comparable approaches in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, and code is available at github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](http://github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars) |

Yet, current diffusion classifiers must evaluate every label candidate for each input, creating high computational costs that impede their use in large-scale applications. To address this limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Diffusion Classifier (HDC) that exploits hierarchical label structures or well-defined parent-child relationships in the dataset. By pruning irrelevant high-level categories and refining predictions only within relevant subcategories (leaf nodes and sub-trees), HDC reduces the total number of class evaluations. As a result, HDC can speed up inference by as much as 60% while preserving and sometimes even improving classification accuracy. In summary, our work provides a tunable control mechanism between speed and precision, making diffusion-based classification more feasible for large-scale applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIP meets DINO for Tuning Zero-Shot Classifier using Unlabeled Image Collections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19346v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text & visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual & textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFTer across 11 diverse image classification datasets.

Annotation-free methods, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged to address this challenge; however, current SSL techniques often depend on synthetic augmentations or temporal context, which may not adequately capture the intricate spatial relationships inherent to histopathology. In this work, we introduce a novel spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy for SSL that leverages the natural coherence of adjacent patches in WSIs. By constructing biologically relevant positive pairs from spatially proximate patches, our approach harnesses inherent spatial coherence to enhance patch-level representations, ultimately boosting slide-level classification performance. Experiments on multiple datasets reveal that our strategy improves classification accuracy by 5\% to 10\% over the standard method, paving the way for more clinically relevant AI models in cancer diagnosis.

| **[Rethinking Pre-Trained Feature Extractor Selection in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01167v5)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a preferred method for gigapixel whole slide image (WSI) classification without requiring patch-level annotations. Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset; 2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We hope that these insights can provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of the current SOTA pathology foundation models. Furthermore, this work may inform the development of more effective pathology foundation models.

However, HPO is often a time-consuming and computationally intensive task. Traditional HPO methods, such as grid search and random search, often suffer from inefficiency. Bayesian optimization, while more efficient, still struggles with high-dimensional search spaces. In this paper, we contribute to the field by exploring how insights gained from hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can be leveraged to accelerate HPO, reducing both time and computational resources. Building on prior work that quantified hyperparameter importance by evaluating 10 hyperparameters on CNNs using 10 common image classification datasets, we implement a novel HPO strategy called 'Sequential Grouping.' That prior work assessed the importance weights of the investigated hyperparameters based on their influence on model performance, providing valuable insights that we leverage to optimize our HPO process. Our experiments, validated across six additional image classification datasets, demonstrate that incorporating hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can significantly accelerate HPO without compromising model performance, reducing optimization time by an average of 31.9\% compared to the conventional simultaneous strategy.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

Existing efforts to restore blurry hieroglyphs adopt computer vision techniques such as CNNs and model hieroglyph recovery as an image classification task, which suffers from two major limitations: (i) They cannot handle severely damaged or completely missing hieroglyphs. (ii) They make predictions based on a single hieroglyph without considering contextual and grammatical information. This paper proposes a novel approach to model hieroglyph recovery as a next word prediction task and use language models to address it. We compare the performance of different SOTA language models and choose LSTM as the architecture of our HieroLM due to the strong local affinity of semantics in Egyptian hieroglyph texts. Experiments show that HieroLM achieves over 44% accuracy and maintains notable performance on multi-shot predictions and scarce data, which makes it a pragmatic tool to assist scholars in inferring missing hieroglyphs. It can also complement CV-based models to significantly reduce perplexity in recognizing blurry hieroglyphs.

Our analysis highlights the advantages of using the Laplace gating function over the traditional Softmax gating within the HMoE frameworks. We theoretically demonstrate that applying the Laplace gating function at both levels of the HMoE model helps eliminate undesirable parameter interactions caused by the Softmax gating and, therefore, accelerates the expert convergence as well as enhances the expert specialization. Empirical validation across diverse scenarios supports these theoretical claims. This includes large-scale multimodal tasks, image classification, and latent domain discovery and prediction tasks, where our modified HMoE models show great performance improvements compared to the conventional HMoE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Huy N...</summary><p>Huy Nguyen and Xing Han contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we describe a new detector that: relies on embedded feature representations to estimate (invert) the backdoor and to identify its target class; can operate without access to the training dataset; and is highly effective for various incorporation mechanisms (i.e., is backdoor agnostic). Our detection approach is evaluated -- and found to be favorable - in comparison with an array of published defenses for a variety of different attacks on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image-classification domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Detecting Systematic Weaknesses in Vision Models along Predefined Human-Understandable Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12360v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slice discovery methods (SDMs) are prominent algorithms for finding systematic weaknesses in DNNs. They identify top-k semantically coherent slices/subsets of data where a DNN-under-test has low performance. For being directly useful, slices should be aligned with human-understandable and relevant dimensions, which, for example, are defined by safety and domain experts as part of the operational design domain (ODD). While SDMs can be applied effectively on structured data, their application on image data is complicated by the lack of semantic metadata. To address these issues, we present an algorithm that combines foundation models for zero-shot image classification to generate semantic metadata with methods for combinatorial search to find systematic weaknesses in images. In contrast to existing approaches, ours identifies weak slices that are in line with pre-defined human-understandable dimensions. As the algorithm includes foundation models, its intermediate and final results may not always be exact. Therefore, we include an approach to address the impact of noisy metadata. We validate our algorithm on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to recover human-understandable systematic weaknesses. Furthermore, using our approach, we identify systematic weaknesses of multiple pre-trained and publicly available state-of-the-art computer vision DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Randomized based restricted kernel machine for hyperspectral image classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05837v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the random vector functional link (RVFL) network has gained significant popularity in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification due to its simplicity, speed, and strong generalization performance. However, despite these advantages, RVFL models face several limitations, particularly in handling non-linear relationships and complex data structures. The random initialization of input-to-hidden weights can lead to instability, and the model struggles with determining the optimal number of hidden nodes, affecting its performance on more challenging datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel randomized based restricted kernel machine ($R^2KM$) model that combines the strehyperngths of RVFL and restricted kernel machines (RKM). $R^2KM$ introduces a layered structure that represents kernel methods using both visible and hidden variables, analogous to the energy function in restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). This structure enables $R^2KM$ to capture complex data interactions and non-linear relationships more effectively, improving both interpretability and model robustness. A key contribution of $R^2KM$ is the introduction of a novel conjugate feature duality based on the Fenchel-Young inequality, which expresses the problem in terms of conjugate dual variables and provides an upper bound on the objective function. This duality enhances the model's flexibility and scalability, offering a more efficient and flexible solution for complex data analysis tasks. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral image datasets and real-world data from the UCI and KEEL repositories show that $R^2KM$ outperforms baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in classification and regression tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their application is often hindered by data scarcity, both in terms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a novel application of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to the landmark detection task, specifically addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in x-ray imaging. Our key innovation lies in leveraging DDPMs for self-supervised pre-training in landmark detection, a previously unexplored approach in this domain. This method enables accurate landmark detection with minimal annotated training data (as few as 50 images), surpassing both ImageNet supervised pre-training and traditional self-supervised techniques across three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Multimodal Medical Image Classification using Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17494v4)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classification of medical images is a pivotal aspect of disease diagnosis, often enhanced by deep learning techniques. However, traditional approaches typically focus on unimodal medical image data, neglecting the integration of diverse non-image patient data. This paper proposes a novel Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning (CGMCL) framework for multimodal structured data from different data domains to improve medical image classification. The model effectively integrates both image and non-image data by constructing cross-modality graphs and leveraging contrastive learning to align multimodal features in a shared latent space. An inter-modality feature scaling module further optimizes the representation learning process by reducing the gap between heterogeneous modalities. The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets: a Parkinson's disease (PD) dataset and a public melanoma dataset. Results demonstrate that CGMCL outperforms conventional unimodal methods in accuracy, interpretability, and early disease prediction. Additionally, the method shows superior performance in multi-class melanoma classification. The CGMCL framework provides valuable insights into medical image classification while offering improved disease interpretability and predictive capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

InfoDisent enables the disentanglement of information in the final layer of any pretrained model into atomic concepts, which can be interpreted as prototypical parts. This approach merges the flexibility of post-hoc methods with the concept-level modeling capabilities of self-explainable neural networks, such as ProtoPNets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoDisent through computational experiments and user studies across various datasets using modern backbones such as ViTs and convolutional networks. Notably, InfoDisent generalizes the prototypical parts approach to novel domains (ImageNet).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Assessing Pre-Trained Models for Transfer Learning Through Distribution of Spectral Components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19085v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained model assessment for transfer learning aims to identify the optimal candidate for the downstream tasks from a model hub, without the need of time-consuming fine-tuning. Existing advanced works mainly focus on analyzing the intrinsic characteristics of the entire features extracted by each pre-trained model or how well such features fit the target labels. This paper proposes a novel perspective for pre-trained model assessment through the Distribution of Spectral Components (DISCO). Through singular value decomposition of features extracted from pre-trained models, we investigate different spectral components and observe that they possess distinct transferability, contributing diversely to the fine-tuning performance. Inspired by this, we propose an assessment method based on the distribution of spectral components which measures the proportions of their corresponding singular values. Pre-trained models with features concentrating on more transferable components are regarded as better choices for transfer learning. We further leverage the labels of downstream data to better estimate the transferability of each spectral component and derive the final assessment criterion. Our proposed method is flexible and can be applied to both classification and regression tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks and two tasks including image classification and object detection, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in choosing proper pre-trained models from the model hub for transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Our approach advances MoE design with four key innovations: (1) We conducted equitant expert decomposition on both MLP blocks and attention blocks based on matrix partition in tensor parallelism. (2) We developed two routing paradigms: patch-wise data selection and expert selection, to apply routing across different levels. (3) We design the architecture of UoE model, including Selective Multi-Head Attention (SMHA) and Union-of-MLP-Experts (UoME). (4) We develop parallel implementation of UoE's routing and computation operation, and optimize efficiency based on the hardware processing analysis. The experiments demonstrate that the UoE model surpass Full Attention, state-of-art MoEs and efficient transformers (including the model architecture of recently proposed DeepSeek-V3) in several tasks across image and natural language domains. In language modeling tasks, we achieve an average reduction of 2.38 in perplexity compared to the best-performed MoE method with an average of 76% FLOPs. In Long Range Arena benchmark, we recorded an average score that is at least 0.68% higher than all comparison models including Full Attention, MoEs, and transformer variants, with only 50% FLOPs of the best MoE method. In image classification, our model yielded an average accuracy improvement of 1.75% than the best model while maintaining comparable FLOPs.

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each whole slide image can be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches take fixed patch features as inputs to address computational constraints and ensure model stability. These features are commonly generated by encoders pre-trained on ImageNet, foundation encoders pre-trained on large datasets, or through self-supervised learning on local datasets. While the self-supervised encoder pre-training on the same dataset as downstream MIL tasks helps mitigate domain shift and generate better features, the bag-level labels are not utilized during the process, and the features of patches from different categories may cluster together, reducing classification performance on MIL tasks. Recently, pre-training with supervised contrastive learning (SupCon) has demonstrated superior performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning and even end-to-end training on traditional image classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder pre-training method for downstream MIL tasks called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive learning losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

This gap hinders the model's ability to synthesize coherent and novel visual representations from textual prompts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multi-modal learning. In this work, we propose MedUnifier, a unified VLP framework tailored for medical data. MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. MedUnifier also offers a highly adaptable tool for a wide range of language and vision tasks in healthcare, marking advancement toward the development of a generalizable AI model for medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be pubilshed in CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

In particular, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful class of models in the field of deep learning for image classification. In this work, we propose a novel Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based method for pruning pre-trained DNNs, based on the sparsification of weights and singular vectors, and apply it to ViTs. RMT provides a robust framework to analyze the statistical properties of large matrices, which has been shown to be crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of DNNs. We demonstrate that our RMT-based pruning can be used to reduce the number of parameters of ViT models (trained on ImageNet) by 30-50\% with less than 1\% loss in accuracy. To our knowledge, this represents the state-of-the-art in pruning for these ViT models. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous mathematical underpinning of the above numerical studies, namely we proved a theorem for fully connected DNNs, and other more general DNN structures, describing how the randomness in the weight matrices of a DNN decreases as the weights approach a local or global minimum (during training). We verify this theorem through numerical experiments on fully connected DNNs, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. Moreover, we prove a theorem that describes how DNN loss decreases as we remove randomness in the weight layers, and show a monotone dependence of the decrease in loss with the amount of randomness that we remove. Our results also provide significant RMT-based insights into the role of regularization during training and pruning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has hindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods necessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the conversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale complexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing algorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and fine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We also introduce an effective delayed evaluation strategy to mitigate the influence of the spike propagation delays. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework in typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and video classification. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. Moreover, we have evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating their superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. This approach simplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN models, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance reduction.

In the context of PDE solvers, recent works have shown that Lie point symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) through data and loss augmentation. Despite this, directly enforcing equivariance within the model architecture for these problems remains elusive. This is because many PDEs admit non-compact symmetry groups, oftentimes not studied beyond their infinitesimal generators, making them incompatible with most existing equivariant architectures. In this work, we propose Lie aLgebrA Canonicalization (LieLAC), a novel approach that exploits only the action of infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group, circumventing the need for knowledge of the full group structure. To achieve this, we address existing theoretical issues in the canonicalization literature, establishing connections with frame averaging in the case of continuous non-compact groups. Operating within the framework of canonicalization, LieLAC can easily be integrated with unconstrained pre-trained models, transforming inputs to a canonical form before feeding them into the existing model, effectively aligning the input for model inference according to allowed symmetries. LieLAC utilizes standard Lie group descent schemes, achieving equivariance in pre-trained models. Finally, we showcase LieLAC's efficacy on tasks of invariant image classification and Lie point symmetry equivariant neural PDE solvers using pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages; accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Here we identify measurement noise in data as another performance scaling axis, governed by a distinct logarithmic law. We focus on representation learning models of biological single cell genomic data, where a dominant source of measurement noise is due to molecular undersampling. We introduce an information-theoretic metric for cellular representation model quality, and find that it scales with sampling depth. A single quantitative relationship holds across several model types and across several datasets. We show that the analytical form of this relationship can be derived from a simple Gaussian noise model, which in turn provides an intuitive interpretation for the scaling law. Finally, we show that the same relationship emerges in image classification models with respect to two types of imaging noise, suggesting that measurement noise scaling may be a general phenomenon. Scaling with noise can serve as a guide in generating and curating data for deep learning models, particularly in fields where measurement quality can vary dramatically between datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[R2Det: Exploring Relaxed Rotation Equivariance in 2D object detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11760v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to explore underlying symmetry in data, improving performance. However, real-world scenarios often deviate from ideal symmetric systems caused by physical permutation, characterized by non-trivial actions of a symmetry group, resulting in asymmetries that affect the outputs, a phenomenon known as Symmetry Breaking. Traditional GConv-based methods are constrained by rigid operational rules within group space, assuming data remains strictly symmetry after limited group transformations. This limitation makes it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking and non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we mainly focus on a common scenario: Rotational Symmetry-Breaking. By relaxing strict group transformations within Strict Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{C}_n$, we redefine a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_n$ and introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant GConv (R2GConv) with only a minimal increase of $4n$ parameters compared to GConv. Based on R2GConv, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and develop a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Object Detector (R2Det) for 2D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed R2GConv in natural image classification, and R2Det achieves excellent performance in 2D object detection with improved generalization capabilities and robustness.

Existing multi-view approaches typically employ separate convolutional or transformer branches combined with simplistic feature fusion strategies. However, these approaches inadvertently disregard essential cross-view correlations, leading to suboptimal classification performance, and suffer from challenges with limited receptive field (CNNs) or quadratic computational complexity (transformers). Inspired by state space sequence models, we propose XFMamba, a pure Mamba-based cross-fusion architecture to address the challenge of multi-view medical image classification. XFMamba introduces a novel two-stage fusion strategy, facilitating the learning of single-view features and their cross-view disparity. This mechanism captures spatially long-range dependencies in each view while enhancing seamless information transfer between views. Results on three public datasets, MURA, CheXpert and DDSM, illustrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse multi-view medical image classification tasks, showing that it outperforms existing convolution-based and transformer-based multi-view methods.

Furthermore, we reach even higher accuracies by utilizing the pretrained VGG16 and MobileNetV2 models as a starting point for transfer learning. Specifically, VGG16 achieves an accuracy of 90% and a test loss of 0.298, while MobileNetV2 outperforms both models with an accuracy of 96% and a test loss of 0.119; the results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for classifying transmission towers, forests, farmland, and mountains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is published in Journal of Computer Science, Volume 21 No. 3, 2025.

In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  | None |

We found that combining explanations with traditional labeled data leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy and training efficiency across multiple image classification datasets and convolutional neural network architectures. It is worth noting that during training, we not only used explanations for the correct or predicted class, but also for other classes. This serves multiple purposes, including allowing for reflection on potential outcomes and enriching the data through augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Most of the ongoing technical validation of foundation models have been applied to optical images like RGB or multi-spectral images. Due to difficulty in semantic labeling to create datasets and higher noise content with respect to optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has not been explored a lot in the field for foundation models. Therefore, in this work as a pre-training approach, we explored masked auto-encoder, specifically MixMAE on Sentinel-1 SAR images and its impact on SAR image classification tasks. Moreover, we proposed to use the physical characteristic of SAR data for applying weighting parameter on the auto-encoder training loss (MSE) to reduce the effect of speckle noise and very high values on the SAR images. Proposed SAR intensity-based weighting of the reconstruction loss demonstrates promising results both on SAR pre-training and downstream tasks specifically on flood detection compared with the baseline model.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure | None |

While most of these approaches aim at improving accuracy, our work focuses on ``making better mistakes", of which the mistakes' severities are derived from the given label hierarchy of downstream tasks. Since CLIP's image encoder is trained with language supervising signals, it implicitly captures the hierarchical semantic relationships between different classes. This motivates our goal of making better mistakes in zero-shot classification, a task for which CLIP is naturally well-suited. Our approach (HAPrompts) queries the language model to produce textual representations for given classes as zero-shot classifiers of CLIP to perform image classification on downstream tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce making better mistakes in CLIP-based zero-shot classification.

However, despite its success, several important questions regarding the convergence properties of SAM in non-convex settings are still open, including the benefits of using normalization in the update rule, the dependence of the analysis on the restrictive bounded variance assumption, and the convergence guarantees under different sampling strategies. To address these questions, in this paper, we provide a unified analysis of SAM and its unnormalized variant (USAM) under one single flexible update rule (Unified SAM), and we present convergence results of the new algorithm under a relaxed and more natural assumption on the stochastic noise. Our analysis provides convergence guarantees for SAM under different step size selections for non-convex problems and functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition (a non-convex generalization of strongly convex functions). The proposed theory holds under the arbitrary sampling paradigm, which includes importance sampling as special case, allowing us to analyze variants of SAM that were never explicitly considered in the literature. Experiments validate the theoretical findings and further demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Unified SAM in training deep neural networks for image classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13th ...</summary><p>13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

While most methodologies extend features in the latent space, few leverage text-driven generation to create realistic and diverse samples. Recently, text-guided diffusion models have gained significant attention due to their ability to generate highly diverse and high-quality images based on text prompts in natural image synthesis. Motivated by this, this paper proposes Txt2HSI-LDM(VAE), a novel language-informed hyperspectral image synthesis method to address the ISSD in HSIC. The proposed approach uses a denoising diffusion model, which iteratively removes Gaussian noise to generate hyperspectral samples conditioned on textual descriptions. First, to address the high-dimensionality of hyperspectral data, a universal variational autoencoder (VAE) is designed to map the data into a low-dimensional latent space, which provides stable features and reduces the inference complexity of diffusion model. Second, a semi-supervised diffusion model is designed to fully take advantage of unlabeled data. Random polygon spatial clipping (RPSC) and uncertainty estimation of latent feature (LF-UE) are used to simulate the varying degrees of mixing. Third, the VAE decodes HSI from latent space generated by the diffusion model with the language conditions as input. In our experiments, we fully evaluate synthetic samples' effectiveness from statistical characteristics and data distribution in 2D-PCA space. Additionally, visual-linguistic cross-attention is visualized on the pixel level to prove that our proposed model can capture the spatial layout and geometry of the generated data. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed Txt2HSI-LDM(VAE) surpasses the classical backbone models, state-of-the-art CNNs, and semi-supervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent open-source work like DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward is one key direction in reproducing o1. While the R1-style model has demonstrated success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains remains under-explored. This work introduces Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT), which further extends the application areas of RFT on visual tasks. Specifically, Visual-RFT first uses Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multiple responses containing reasoning tokens and final answers for each input, and then uses our proposed visual perception verifiable reward functions to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We design different verifiable reward functions for different perception tasks, such as the Intersection over Union (IoU) reward for object detection. Experimental results on fine-grained image classification, few-shot object detection, reasoning grounding, as well as open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced generalization ability of Visual-RFT compared with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). For example, Visual-RFT improves accuracy by $24.3\%$ over the baseline in one-shot fine-grained image classification with around 100 samples. In few-shot object detection, Visual-RFT also exceeds the baseline by $21.9$ on COCO's two-shot setting and $15.4$ on LVIS.

However, their large size and computational complexity present significant challenges for deploying them in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents an innovative approach for integrating Mamba Architecture within a Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) process to address the challenge of reducing model complexity while maintaining accuracy in image classification tasks. The proposed framework distills a large teacher model into progressively smaller student models, designed using Mamba blocks. Each student model is trained using Selective-State-Space Models (S-SSM) within the Mamba blocks, focusing on important input aspects while reducing computational complexity. The work's preliminary experiments use MNIST and CIFAR-10 as datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. For MNIST, the teacher model achieves 98% accuracy. A set of seven student models as a group retained 63% of the teacher's FLOPs, approximating the teacher's performance with 98% accuracy. The weak student used only 1% of the teacher's FLOPs and maintained 72% accuracy. Similarly, for CIFAR-10, the students achieved 1% less accuracy compared to the teacher, with the small student retaining 5% of the teacher's FLOPs to achieve 50% accuracy. These results confirm the flexibility and scalability of Mamba Architecture, which can be integrated into PKD, succeeding in the process of finding students as weak learners. The framework provides a solution for deploying complex neural networks in real-time applications with a reduction in computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of this work was presented as a short poster titled "Mamba-PKD: A Framework for Efficient and Scalable Model Compression in Image Classification" at The 40th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing https://doi.org/10.1145/3672608.3707887</p></details> | None |

Despite their success, challenges remain due to the lack of annotated datasets and standardized evaluation pipelines. In this paper, we introduce Saliency-Bench, a novel benchmark suite designed to evaluate visual explanations generated by saliency methods across multiple datasets. We curated, constructed, and annotated eight datasets, each covering diverse tasks such as scene classification, cancer diagnosis, object classification, and action classification, with corresponding ground-truth explanations. The benchmark includes a standardized and unified evaluation pipeline for assessing faithfulness and alignment of the visual explanation, providing a holistic visual explanation performance assessment. We benchmark these eight datasets with widely used saliency methods on different image classifier architectures to evaluate explanation quality. Additionally, we developed an easy-to-use API for automating the evaluation pipeline, from data accessing, and data loading, to result evaluation. The benchmark is available via our website: https://xaidataset.github.io.</p></details> |  | None |

Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce HiBug2, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. HiBug2 first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, HiBug2 extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that HiBug2 not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance learning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance pre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In addition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based Kolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the performance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> | None |

However, the standard MLP blocks in each Transformer layer may not capture complex nonlinear dependencies optimally. In this paper, we propose ViKANformer, a Vision Transformer where we replace the MLP sub-layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) expansions, including Vanilla KAN, Efficient-KAN, Fast-KAN, SineKAN, and FourierKAN, while also examining a Flash Attention variant. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, which guarantees that multivariate continuous functions can be expressed via sums of univariate continuous functions, we aim to boost representational power. Experimental results on MNIST demonstrate that SineKAN, Fast-KAN, and a well-tuned Vanilla KAN can achieve over 97% accuracy, albeit with increased training overhead. This trade-off highlights that KAN expansions may be beneficial if computational cost is acceptable. We detail the expansions, present training/test accuracy and F1/ROC metrics, and provide pseudocode and hyperparameters for reproducibility. Finally, we compare ViKANformer to a simple MLP and a small CNN baseline on MNIST, illustrating the efficiency of Transformer-based methods even on a small-scale dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper represents ongoing research and may be subject to revisions, refinements, and additional experiments in future updates</p></details> | None |
| **[Delving into Out-of-Distribution Detection with Medical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01020v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in image classification tasks, driven by their strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. However, given the high variability and complexity inherent in medical imaging data, the ability of these models to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data in this domain remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation into the OOD detection potential of medical VLMs. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLM-based OOD detection methods across a diverse set of medical VLMs, including both general and domain-specific purposes. To accurately reflect real-world challenges, we introduce a cross-modality evaluation pipeline for benchmarking full-spectrum OOD detection, rigorously assessing model robustness against both semantic shifts and covariate shifts. Furthermore, we propose a novel hierarchical prompt-based method that significantly enhances OOD detection performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[AMUN: Adversarial Machine UNlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00917v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning, where users can request the deletion of a forget dataset, is becoming increasingly important because of numerous privacy regulations. Initial works on ``exact'' unlearning (e.g., retraining) incur large computational overheads. However, while computationally inexpensive, ``approximate'' methods have fallen short of reaching the effectiveness of exact unlearning: models produced fail to obtain comparable accuracy and prediction confidence on both the forget and test (i.e., unseen) dataset. Exploiting this observation, we propose a new unlearning method, Adversarial Machine UNlearning (AMUN), that outperforms prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for image classification. AMUN lowers the confidence of the model on the forget samples by fine-tuning the model on their corresponding adversarial examples. Adversarial examples naturally belong to the distribution imposed by the model on the input space; fine-tuning the model on the adversarial examples closest to the corresponding forget samples (a) localizes the changes to the decision boundary of the model around each forget sample and (b) avoids drastic changes to the global behavior of the model, thereby preserving the model's accuracy on test samples. Using AMUN for unlearning a random $10\%$ of CIFAR-10 samples, we observe that even SOTA membership inference attacks cannot do better than random guessing.</p></details> |  | None |

A wide variety of benchmark datasets with many classes (80-1000) have been created to assist Computer Vision architectural evolution. An increasing number of vision models are evaluated with these many-class datasets. However, real-world applications often involve substantially fewer classes of interest (2-10). This gap between many and few classes makes it difficult to predict performance of the few-class applications using models trained on the available many-class datasets. To date, little has been offered to evaluate models in this Few-Class Regime. We conduct a systematic evaluation of the ResNet family trained on ImageNet subsets from 2 to 1000 classes, and test a wide spectrum of Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architectures over ten datasets by using our newly proposed FCA tool. Furthermore, to aid an up-front assessment of dataset difficulty and a more efficient selection of models, we incorporate a difficulty measure as a function of class similarity. FCA offers a new tool for efficient machine learning in the Few-Class Regime, with goals ranging from a new efficient class similarity proposal, to lightweight model architecture design, to a new scaling law. FCA is user-friendly and can be easily extended to new models and datasets, facilitating future research work.

| **[Parameter Expanded Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00699v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a promising framework for modeling predictive uncertainty and enhancing out-of-distribution robustness (OOD) by estimating the posterior distribution of network parameters. Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) is one of the most powerful methods for scalable posterior sampling in BNNs, achieving efficiency by combining stochastic gradient descent with second-order Langevin dynamics. However, SGMCMC often suffers from limited sample diversity in practice, which affects uncertainty estimation and model performance. We propose a simple yet effective approach to enhance sample diversity in SGMCMC without the need for tempering or running multiple chains. Our approach reparameterizes the neural network by decomposing each of its weight matrices into a product of matrices, resulting in a sampling trajectory that better explores the target parameter space. This approach produces a more diverse set of samples, allowing faster mixing within the same computational budget. Notably, our sampler achieves these improvements without increasing the inference cost compared to the standard SGMCMC. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks, including OOD robustness, diversity, loss surface analyses, and a comparative study with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HDKD: Hybrid Data-Efficient Knowledge Distillation Network for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07516v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved significant advancement in computer vision tasks due to their powerful modeling capacity. However, their performance notably degrades when trained with insufficient data due to lack of inherent inductive biases. Distilling knowledge and inductive biases from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) teacher has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the generalization of ViTs on limited datasets. Previous approaches to Knowledge Distillation (KD) have pursued two primary paths: some focused solely on distilling the logit distribution from CNN teacher to ViT student, neglecting the rich semantic information present in intermediate features due to the structural differences between them. Others integrated feature distillation along with logit distillation, yet this introduced alignment operations that limits the amount of knowledge transferred due to mismatched architectures and increased the computational overhead. To this end, this paper presents Hybrid Data-efficient Knowledge Distillation (HDKD) paradigm which employs a CNN teacher and a hybrid student. The choice of hybrid student serves two main aspects. First, it leverages the strengths of both convolutions and transformers while sharing the convolutional structure with the teacher model. Second, this shared structure enables the direct application of feature distillation without any information loss or additional computational overhead. Additionally, we propose an efficient light-weight convolutional block named Mobile Channel-Spatial Attention (MBCSA), which serves as the primary convolutional block in both teacher and student models. Extensive experiments on two medical public datasets showcase the superiority of HDKD over other state-of-the-art models and its computational efficiency.

In this paper, we study the problem of using meta-learning to deal with uncertainty and heterogeneity in ergodic linear quadratic regulators. We integrate the zeroth-order optimization technique with a typical meta-learning method, proposing an algorithm that omits the estimation of policy Hessian, which applies to tasks of learning a set of heterogeneous but similar linear dynamic systems. The induced meta-objective function inherits important properties of the original cost function when the set of linear dynamic systems are meta-learnable, allowing the algorithm to optimize over a learnable landscape without projection onto the feasible set. We provide stability and convergence guarantees for the exact gradient descent process by analyzing the boundedness and local smoothness of the gradient for the meta-objective, which justify the proposed algorithm with gradient estimation error being small. We provide the sample complexity conditions for these theoretical guarantees, as well as a numerical example at the end to corroborate this perspective.</p></details> |  | None |

These attacks have a varied level of potency and can be implemented in both white box and black box approaches. Practical attacks include methods to manipulate the physical world and enforce adversarial behaviour by the corresponding target neural network models. Multiple different approaches to mitigate different kinds of such attacks are available in the literature, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive systematization of knowledge on adversarial defenses, focusing on two key computer vision tasks: image classification and object detection. We review the state-of-the-art adversarial defense techniques and categorize them for easier comparison. In addition, we provide a schematic representation of these categories within the context of the overall machine learning pipeline, facilitating clearer understanding and benchmarking of defenses. Furthermore, we map these defenses to the types of adversarial attacks and datasets where they are most effective, offering practical insights for researchers and practitioners. This study is necessary for understanding the scope of how the available defenses are able to address the adversarial threats, and their shortcomings as well, which is necessary for driving the research in this area in the most appropriate direction, with the aim of building trustworthy AI systems for regular practical use-cases.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep learning models for thyroid scintigraphy classification often face challenges due to limited and imbalanced datasets, leading to suboptimal generalization. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of different data augmentation techniques including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA) to enhance the performance of a ResNet18 classifier for thyroid condition classification. Our results showed that FM-based augmentation consistently outperforms SD-based approaches, particularly when combined with original (O) data and CA (O+FM+CA), achieving both high accuracy and fair classification across Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI) cases. The Wilcoxon statistical analysis further validated the superiority of O+FM and its variants (O+FM+CA) over SD-based augmentations in most scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of FM-based augmentation as a superior approach for generating high-quality synthetic thyroid scintigraphy images and improving model generalization in medical image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

These problems can be solved by engaging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provided with embedded platforms and optical sensors. In this work, we focus on enabling onboard aerial image processing to ensure proper and real-time disaster detection. Such a setting usually causes challenges due to the limited hardware resources of UAVs. However, privacy, connectivity, and latency issues can be avoided. We suggest a UAV-assisted edge framework for disaster detection, leveraging our proposed model optimized for onboard real-time aerial image classification. The optimization of the model is achieved using post-training quantization techniques. To address the limited number of disaster cases in existing benchmark datasets and therefore ensure real-world adoption of our model, we construct a novel dataset, DisasterEye, featuring disaster scenes captured by UAVs and individuals on-site. Experimental results reveal the efficacy of our model, reaching high accuracy with lowered inference latency and memory use on both traditional machines and resource-limited devices. This shows that the scalability and adaptability of our method make it a powerful solution for real-time disaster management on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  | None |

This study delves into the often-overlooked parameter within the softmax function, known as "temperature," providing novel insights into the practical and theoretical aspects of temperature scaling for image classification. Our empirical studies, adopting convolutional neural networks and transformers on multiple benchmark datasets, reveal that moderate temperatures generally introduce better overall performance. Through extensive experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis, we explore the role of temperature scaling in model training and unveil that temperature not only influences learning step size but also shapes the model's optimization direction. Moreover, for the first time, we discover a surprising benefit of elevated temperatures: enhanced model robustness against common corruption, natural perturbation, and non-targeted adversarial attacks like Projected Gradient Descent. We extend our discoveries to adversarial training, demonstrating that, compared to the standard softmax function with the default temperature value, higher temperatures have the potential to enhance adversarial training. The insights of this work open new avenues for improving model performance and security in deep learning applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, limited research explores if the merging process can occur within one model and enhance the model's robustness, which is particularly critical in the medical image domain. In the paper, we are the first to propose in-model merging (InMerge), a novel approach that enhances the model's robustness by selectively merging similar convolutional kernels in the deep layers of a single convolutional neural network (CNN) during the training process for classification. We also analytically reveal important characteristics that affect how in-model merging should be performed, serving as an insightful reference for the community. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this technique for different CNN architectures on 4 prevalent datasets.

Meanwhile, recent studies also reveal that with proper architecture design, convolutional networks (ConvNets) also achieve competitive performance with transformers. However, no prior methods have explored to utilize pure convolution to build a Transformer-style Decoder module, which is essential for Encoder-Decoder architecture like Detection Transformer (DETR). To this end, in this paper we explore whether we could build query-based detection and segmentation framework with ConvNets instead of sophisticated transformer architecture. We propose a novel mechanism dubbed InterConv to perform interaction between object queries and image features via convolutional layers. Equipped with the proposed InterConv, we build Detection ConvNet (DECO), which is composed of a backbone and convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. We compare the proposed DECO against prior detectors on the challenging COCO benchmark. Despite its simplicity, our DECO achieves competitive performance in terms of detection accuracy and running speed. Specifically, with the ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 backbone, our DECO achieves $40.5\%$ and $47.8\%$ AP with $66$ and $34$ FPS, respectively. The proposed method is also evaluated on the segment anything task, demonstrating similar performance and higher efficiency. We hope the proposed method brings another perspective for designing architectures for vision tasks.

While recent models can locally explain a single decision, to provide a faithful global explanation about an accurate model's general behavior is a more challenging open task. Towards that goal, we introduce the Quadratic Programming Enhanced Model (QPM), which learns globally interpretable class representations. QPM represents every class with a binary assignment of very few, typically 5, features, that are also assigned to other classes, ensuring easily comparable contrastive class representations. This compact binary assignment is found using discrete optimization based on predefined similarity measures and interpretability constraints. The resulting optimal assignment is used to fine-tune the diverse features, so that each of them becomes the shared general concept between the assigned classes. Extensive evaluations show that QPM delivers unprecedented global interpretability across small and large-scale datasets while setting the state of the art for the accuracy of interpretable models.</p></details> |  | None |

Such powerful models demonstrate advanced generative ability and multimodal understanding capability, which quickly set new state of the arts on a variety of benchmarks. The pre-trained LLM usually plays the role as a universal AI model that can conduct various tasks like article analysis and image comprehension. However, due to the prohibitively high memory and computational cost of implementing such a large model, the conventional models (such as CNN and ViT) are still essential for many visual perception tasks. In this paper, we propose to enhance the representation ability of ordinary vision models on perception tasks (e.g. image classification) by taking advantage of the off-the-shelf large pre-trained models. We present a new learning framework, dubbed GPT4Image, where the knowledge of the large pre-trained models are extracted to help CNNs and ViTs learn better representations and achieve higher performance. Firstly, we curate a high quality description set by prompting a multimodal LLM to generate descriptions for training images. Then, these detailed descriptions are fed into a pre-trained encoder to extract text embeddings that encodes the rich semantics of images. During training, text embeddings will serve as extra supervising signal and be aligned with image representations learned by vision models. The alignment process helps vision models achieve better performance with the aid of pre-trained LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on various visual perception tasks for heterogeneous model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub: https://github.com/huawei-noah/Efficient-Computing/tree/master/GPT4Image/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Efficient-Computing) |

Some prompting techniques introduce prior knowledge due to its richness, but when learnable tokens are randomly initialized and disconnected from prior knowledge, they tend to overfit on seen classes and struggle with domain shifts for unseen ones. To address this issue, we propose the InPK model, which infuses class-specific prior knowledge into the learnable tokens during initialization, thus enabling the model to explicitly focus on class-relevant information. Furthermore, to mitigate the weakening of class information by multi-layer encoders, we continuously reinforce the interaction between learnable tokens and prior knowledge across multiple feature levels. This progressive interaction allows the learnable tokens to better capture the fine-grained differences and universal visual concepts within prior knowledge, enabling the model to extract more discriminative and generalized text features. Even for unseen classes, the learned interaction allows the model to capture their common representations and infer their appropriate positions within the existing semantic structure. Moreover, we introduce a learnable text-to-vision projection layer to accommodate the text adjustments, ensuring better alignment of visual-text semantics. Extensive experiments on 11 recognition datasets show that InPK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple zero/few-shot image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their empirical success, the underlying mechanisms of MAEs remain insufficiently understood. Recent studies have attempted to elucidate the functioning of MAEs through contrastive learning and feature representation analysis, yet these approaches often provide only implicit insights. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for understanding MAEs by leveraging the information bottleneck principle in information theory. Our theoretical analyses reveal that optimizing the latent features to balance relevant and irrelevant information is key to improving MAE performance. Building upon our proofs, we introduce MI-MAE, a novel method that optimizes MAEs through mutual information maximization and minimization. By enhancing latent features to retain maximal relevant information between them and the output, and minimizing irrelevant information between them and the input, our approach achieves better performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that MI-MAE significantly outperforms MAE models in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Our findings validate the theoretical framework and highlight the practical advantages of applying the information bottleneck principle to MAEs, offering deeper insights for developing more powerful self-supervised learning models.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

The framework has no strict restriction on the fraction of honest workers, extending the applicability of Byzantine federated learning to the scenario with more than half adversaries. Under proper assumptions on the loss function, we prove a convergence theorem for our method. Experimental results, including image classification tasks with both convex and non-convex losses, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can withstand the malicious majority under various attacks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures | None |

This paper presents a Spatial-Spectral Diffusion Contrastive Representation Network (DiffCRN), based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) combined with contrastive learning (CL) for HSIC, with the following characteristics. First,to improve spatial-spectral feature representation, instead of adopting the UNets-like structure which is widely used for DDPM, we design a novel staged architecture with spatial self-attention denoising module (SSAD) and spectral group self-attention denoising module (SGSAD) in DiffCRN with improved efficiency for spectral-spatial feature learning. Second, to improve unsupervised feature learning efficiency, we design new DDPM model with logarithmic absolute error (LAE) loss and CL that improve the loss function effectiveness and increase the instance-level and inter-class discriminability. Third, to improve feature selection, we design a learnable approach based on pixel-level spectral angle mapping (SAM) for the selection of time steps in the proposed DDPM model in an adaptive and automatic manner. Last, to improve feature integration and classification, we design an Adaptive weighted addition modul (AWAM) and Cross time step Spectral-Spatial Fusion Module (CTSSFM) to fuse time-step-wise features and perform classification. Experiments conducted on widely used four HSI datasets demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed DiffCRN over the classical backbone models and state-of-the-art GAN, transformer models and other pretrained methods. The source code and pre-trained model will be made available publicly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Fusion Model for Artwork Identification Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18083v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of artwork is crucial in areas like cultural heritage protection, art market analysis, and historical research. With the advancement of deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models have become key tools for image classification. While CNNs excel in local feature extraction, they struggle with global context, and Transformers are strong in capturing global dependencies but weak in fine-grained local details. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fusion model combining CNNs and Transformers for artwork identification. The model first extracts local features using CNNs, then captures global context with a Transformer, followed by a feature fusion mechanism to enhance classification accuracy. Experiments on Chinese and oil painting datasets show the fusion model outperforms individual CNN and Transformer models, improving classification accuracy by 9.7% and 7.1%, respectively, and increasing F1 scores by 0.06 and 0.05. The results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and potential for future improvements, such as multimodal integration and architecture optimization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Residual Multi-task Network for Joint Classification and Regression in Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19692v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection and classification of pulmonary nodules is a challenge in medical image analysis due to the variety of shapes and sizes of nodules and their high concealment. Despite the success of traditional deep learning methods in image classification, deep networks still struggle to perfectly capture subtle changes in lung nodule detection. Therefore, we propose a residual multi-task network (Res-MTNet) model, which combines multi-task learning and residual learning, and improves feature representation ability by sharing feature extraction layer and introducing residual connections. Multi-task learning enables the model to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, while the residual module solves the problem of disappearing gradients, ensuring stable training of deeper networks and facilitating information sharing between tasks. Res-MTNet enhances the robustness and accuracy of the model, providing a more reliable lung nodule analysis tool for clinical medicine and telemedicine.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire further research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient deployment on edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |

To mitigate these challenges, local smaller models are often deployed alongside larger models, relying on routing and deferral mechanisms to offload complex tasks. However, existing approaches inadequately balance the capabilities of these models, often resulting in unnecessary deferrals or sub-optimal resource usage. In this work we introduce a novel loss function called Gatekeeper for calibrating smaller models in cascade setups. Our approach fine-tunes the smaller model to confidently handle tasks it can perform correctly while deferring complex tasks to the larger model. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism for managing the trade-off between model performance and deferral accuracy, and is broadly applicable across various tasks and domains without any architectural changes. We evaluate our method on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. Experiments across image classification, language modeling, and vision-language tasks show that our approach substantially improves deferral performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spatial-Mamba: Effective Visual State Space Models via Structure-aware State Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15091v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, highly excel at capturing long-range dependencies in 1D sequential data, while their applications to 2D vision tasks still face challenges. Current visual SSMs often convert images into 1D sequences and employ various scanning patterns to incorporate local spatial dependencies. However, these methods are limited in effectively capturing the complex image spatial structures and the increased computational cost caused by the lengthened scanning paths. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial-Mamba, a novel approach that establishes neighborhood connectivity directly in the state space. Instead of relying solely on sequential state transitions, we introduce a structure-aware state fusion equation, which leverages dilated convolutions to capture image spatial structural dependencies, significantly enhancing the flow of visual contextual information. Spatial-Mamba proceeds in three stages: initial state computation in a unidirectional scan, spatial context acquisition through structure-aware state fusion, and final state computation using the observation equation. Our theoretical analysis shows that Spatial-Mamba unifies the original Mamba and linear attention under the same matrix multiplication framework, providing a deeper understanding of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial-Mamba, even with a single scan, attains or surpasses the state-of-the-art SSM-based models in image classification, detection and segmentation.

Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose \underline{G}reat L\underline{o}R\underline{A} Mixture-of-Exper\underline{t} (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance. Experiments across 25 datasets, including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, image classification, and natural language generation, demonstrate GOAT's state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual Selective Fusion Transformer Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03171v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer has achieved satisfactory results in the field of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, existing Transformer models face two key challenges when dealing with HSI scenes characterized by diverse land cover types and rich spectral information: (1) A fixed receptive field overlooks the effective contextual scales required by various HSI objects; (2) invalid self-attention features in context fusion affect model performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Dual Selective Fusion Transformer Network (DSFormer) for HSI classification. DSFormer achieves joint spatial and spectral contextual modeling by flexibly selecting and fusing features across different receptive fields, effectively reducing unnecessary information interference by focusing on the most relevant spatial-spectral tokens. Specifically, we design a Kernel Selective Fusion Transformer Block (KSFTB) to learn an optimal receptive field by adaptively fusing spatial and spectral features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to accurately identify diverse HSI objects. Additionally, we introduce a Token Selective Fusion Transformer Block (TSFTB), which strategically selects and combines essential tokens during the spatial-spectral self-attention fusion process to capture the most crucial contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed DSFormer significantly improves land cover classification accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, DSFormer achieves overall accuracies of 96.59%, 97.66%, 95.17%, and 94.59% in the Pavia University, Houston, Indian Pines, and Whu-HongHu datasets, respectively, reflecting improvements of 3.19%, 1.14%, 0.91%, and 2.80% over the previous model.

A key challenge is catastrophic forgetting (CF), and most research efforts have been directed toward mitigating this issue. However, a significant gap remains between the accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms and the ideal or upper-bound accuracy achieved by training all tasks together jointly. This gap has hindered or even prevented the adoption of continual learning in applications, as accuracy is often of paramount importance. Recently, another challenge, termed inter-task class separation (ICS), was also identified, which spurred a theoretical study into principled approaches for solving continual learning. Further research has shown that by leveraging the theory and the power of large foundation models, it is now possible to achieve upper-bound accuracy, which has been empirically validated using both text and image classification datasets. Continual learning is now ready for real-life applications. This paper surveys the main research leading to this achievement, justifies the approach both intuitively and from neuroscience research, and discusses insights gained.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Time Traveling to Defend Against Adversarial Example Attacks in Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08338v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial example attacks have emerged as a critical threat to machine learning. Adversarial attacks in image classification abuse various, minor modifications to the image that confuse the image classification neural network -- while the image still remains recognizable to humans. One important domain where the attacks have been applied is in the automotive setting with traffic sign classification. Researchers have demonstrated that adding stickers, shining light, or adding shadows are all different means to make machine learning inference algorithms mis-classify the traffic signs. This can cause potentially dangerous situations as a stop sign is recognized as a speed limit sign causing vehicles to ignore it and potentially leading to accidents. To address these attacks, this work focuses on enhancing defenses against such adversarial attacks. This work shifts the advantage to the user by introducing the idea of leveraging historical images and majority voting. While the attacker modifies a traffic sign that is currently being processed by the victim's machine learning inference, the victim can gain advantage by examining past images of the same traffic sign. This work introduces the notion of ''time traveling'' and uses historical Street View images accessible to anybody to perform inference on different, past versions of the same traffic sign. In the evaluation, the proposed defense has 100% effectiveness against latest adversarial example attack on traffic sign classification algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fall Leaf Adversarial Attack on Traffic Sign Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18776v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial input image perturbation attacks have emerged as a significant threat to machine learning algorithms, particularly in image classification setting. These attacks involve subtle perturbations to input images that cause neural networks to misclassify the input images, even though the images remain easily recognizable to humans. One critical area where adversarial attacks have been demonstrated is in automotive systems where traffic sign classification and recognition is critical, and where misclassified images can cause autonomous systems to take wrong actions. This work presents a new class of adversarial attacks. Unlike existing work that has focused on adversarial perturbations that leverage human-made artifacts to cause the perturbations, such as adding stickers, paint, or shining flashlights at traffic signs, this work leverages nature-made artifacts: tree leaves. By leveraging nature-made artifacts, the new class of attacks has plausible deniability: a fall leaf stuck to a street sign could come from a near-by tree, rather than be placed there by an malicious human attacker. To evaluate the new class of the adversarial input image perturbation attacks, this work analyses how fall leaves can cause misclassification in street signs. The work evaluates various leaves from different species of trees, and considers various parameters such as size, color due to tree leaf type, and rotation. The work demonstrates high success rate for misclassification. The work also explores the correlation between successful attacks and how they affect the edge detection, which is critical in many image classification algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Image Classification with Augmentation: Data Augmentation Techniques for Improved Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18691v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve as the workhorse of deep learning, finding applications in various fields that rely on images. Given sufficient data, they exhibit the capacity to learn a wide range of concepts across diverse settings. However, a notable limitation of CNNs is their susceptibility to overfitting when trained on small datasets. The augmentation of such datasets can significantly enhance CNN performance by introducing additional data points for learning. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of 11 different sets of data augmentation techniques, which include three novel sets proposed in this work. The first set of data augmentation employs pairwise channel transfer, transferring Red, Green, Blue, Hue, and Saturation values from randomly selected images in the database to all images in the dataset. The second set introduces a novel occlusion approach, where objects in the images are occluded by randomly selected objects from the dataset. The third set involves a novel masking approach, using vertical, horizontal, circular, and checkered masks to occlude portions of the images. In addition to these novel techniques, we investigate other existing augmentation methods, including rotation, horizontal and vertical flips, resizing, translation, blur, color jitter, and random erasing, and their effects on accuracy and overfitting. We fine-tune a base EfficientNet-B0 model for each augmentation method and conduct a comparative analysis to showcase their efficacy. For the evaluation and comparison of these augmentation techniques, we utilize the Caltech-101 dataset. The ensemble of image augmentation techniques proposed emerges as the most effective on the Caltech-101 dataset. The results demonstrate that diverse data augmentation techniques present a viable means of enhancing datasets for improved image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models face notable challenges in medical imaging, particularly in capturing intricate texture details and contextual features. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) represent a novel class of architectures that enhance nonlinear transformation modeling, offering improved representation of complex features. In this work, we present MedKAN, a medical image classification framework built upon KAN and its convolutional extensions. MedKAN features two core modules: the Local Information KAN (LIK) module for fine-grained feature extraction and the Global Information KAN (GIK) module for global context integration. By combining these modules, MedKAN achieves robust feature modeling and fusion. To address diverse computational needs, we introduce three scalable variants--MedKAN-S, MedKAN-B, and MedKAN-L. Experimental results on nine public medical imaging datasets demonstrate that MedKAN achieves superior performance compared to CNN- and Transformer-based models, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual Classification Head Self-training Network for Cross-scene Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17879v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the difficulty of obtaining labeled data for hyperspectral images (HSIs), cross-scene classification has emerged as a widely adopted approach in the remote sensing community. It involves training a model using labeled data from a source domain (SD) and unlabeled data from a target domain (TD), followed by inferencing on the TD. However, variations in the reflectance spectrum of the same object between the SD and the TD, as well as differences in the feature distribution of the same land cover class, pose significant challenges to the performance of cross-scene classification. To address this issue, we propose a dual classification head self-training network (DHSNet). This method aligns class-wise features across domains, ensuring that the trained classifier can accurately classify TD data of different classes. We introduce a dual classification head self-training strategy for the first time in the cross-scene HSI classification field. The proposed approach mitigates domain gap while preventing the accumulation of incorrect pseudo-labels in the model. Additionally, we incorporate a novel central feature attention mechanism to enhance the model's capacity to learn scene-invariant features across domains. Experimental results on three cross-scene HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed DHSNET significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. The code for DHSNet will be available at https://github.com/liurongwhm.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges arise when the teacher's predictions are noisy, or the data domain during student training shifts from the teacher's pretraining data. In such scenarios, blindly relying on the teacher's predictions can lead to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and universal framework, Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Knowledge Transfer ($\textbf{AUKT}$), which leverages Conformal Prediction (CP) to dynamically adjust the student's reliance on the teacher's guidance based on the teacher's prediction uncertainty. CP is a distribution-free, model-agnostic approach that provides reliable prediction sets with statistical coverage guarantees and minimal computational overhead. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the risk of learning undesirable or incorrect knowledge. We validate the proposed framework across diverse applications, including image classification, imitation-guided reinforcement learning, and autonomous driving. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach improves performance, robustness and transferability, offering a promising direction for enhanced knowledge transfer in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

When applied to vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), existing VR approaches follow the same pipeline used in vision models (e.g., ResNet, ViT), where ground-truth class labels are inserted into fixed text templates to guide the optimization of VR patterns. This label-based approach, however, overlooks the rich information and diverse attribute-guided textual representations that CLIP can exploit, which may lead to the misclassification of samples. In this paper, we propose Attribute-based Visual Reprogramming (AttrVR) for CLIP, utilizing descriptive attributes (DesAttrs) and distinctive attributes (DistAttrs), which respectively represent common and unique feature descriptions for different classes. Besides, as images of the same class may reflect different attributes after VR, AttrVR iteratively refines patterns using the $k$-nearest DesAttrs and DistAttrs for each image sample, enabling more dynamic and sample-specific optimization. Theoretically, AttrVR is shown to reduce intra-class variance and increase inter-class separation. Empirically, it achieves superior performance in 12 downstream tasks for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP. The success of AttrVR facilitates more effective integration of VR from unimodal vision models into vision-language models.
