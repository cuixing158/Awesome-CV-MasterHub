| **[Gompertz Linear Units: Leveraging Asymmetry for Enhanced Learning Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03654v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation functions are fundamental elements of deep learning architectures as they significantly influence training dynamics. ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the right-skewed asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix; v2: slight improvement in presentation.

| **[FragFake: A Dataset for Fine-Grained Detection of Edited Images with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15644v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained edited image detection of localized edits in images is crucial for assessing content authenticity, especially given that modern diffusion models and image editing methods can produce highly realistic manipulations. However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3) No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets, significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.</p></details> | 14pages,15 figures | None |
| **[SNAP: A Benchmark for Testing the Effects of Capture Conditions on Fundamental Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15628v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization of deep-learning-based (DL) computer vision algorithms to various image perturbations is hard to establish and remains an active area of research. The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured, whereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less studied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of capture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model performance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common vision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\textbf{S}$hutter speed, ISO se$\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of objects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled camera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show the effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we conduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our results show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models trained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed images, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute variations of camera settings.

| **[Aligning Explanations with Human Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15626v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning explainability aims to make the decision-making process of black-box models more transparent by finding the most important input features for a given prediction task. Recent works have proposed composing explanations from semantic concepts (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) that are inherently interpretable to the user of a model. However, these methods generally ignore the communicative context of explanation-the ability of the user to understand the prediction of the model from the explanation. For example, while a medical doctor might understand an explanation in terms of clinical markers, a patient may need a more accessible explanation to make sense of the same diagnosis. In this paper, we address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations. We propose an iterative procedure grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the rational speech act to generate explanations that maximize communicative utility. Our procedure only needs access to pairwise preferences between candidate explanations, relevant in real-world scenarios where a listener model may not be available. We evaluate our method in image classification tasks, demonstrating improved alignment between explanations and listener preferences across three datasets. Furthermore, we perform a user study that demonstrates our explanations increase communicative utility.</p></details> |  | None |

To mitigate this, we introduce BiSSL, a novel bilevel training framework that enhances the alignment of self-supervised pretrained models with downstream tasks prior to fine-tuning. BiSSL acts as an intermediate training stage conducted after conventional self-supervised pretraining and is tasked with solving a bilevel optimization problem that incorporates the pretext and downstream training objectives in its lower- and upper-level objectives, respectively. This approach explicitly models the interdependence between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages within the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline, facilitating enhanced information sharing between them that ultimately leads to a model initialization better aligned with the downstream task. We propose a general training algorithm for BiSSL that is compatible with a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pretrain ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves accuracy on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Exploratory analyses alongside investigative experiments further provide compelling evidence that BiSSL enhances downstream alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Linearity: Squeeze-and-Recalibrate Blocks for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15504v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters and no architectural changes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Temperature Scaling with Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15437v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction enables the construction of high-coverage prediction sets for any pre-trained model, guaranteeing that the true label lies within the set with a specified probability. However, these sets do not provide probability estimates for individual labels, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method for assigning calibrated probabilities to elements of a conformal prediction set. Our approach frames this as an adaptive calibration problem, selecting an input-specific temperature parameter to match the desired coverage level. Experiments on several challenging image classification datasets demonstrate that our method maintains coverage guarantees while significantly reducing expected calibration error.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multispectral Foundation Models for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15334v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved great success across diverse domains, including remote sensing (RS), thanks to their versatility and strong generalization abilities. However, most RS foundation models are designed for multispectral data, while hyperspectral imagery (HSI) - with its hundreds of spectral bands - remains less explored. Fine-tuning such models for downstream tasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a multispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). We explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank Kronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for low-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce KronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We evaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning (FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral foundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the training epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar performance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds only approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT method tested.</p></details> | 33 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned for a specific downstream task. The most common fine-tuning method is to update pretrained weights via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Existing initialization strategies for LoRA often rely on singular value decompositions (SVD) of gradients or weight matrices. However, they do not provably maximize the expected gradient signal, which is critical for fast adaptation. To this end, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme that uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably maximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA performs incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the right-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by selecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given rank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of trainable parameters, while maintaining or improving downstream performance. We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as language generation and understanding, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + references and appendix, code available at https://github.com/ml-jku/EVA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ml-jku/EVA) |
| **[Enrich the content of the image Using Context-Aware Copy Paste](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08151v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation remains a widely utilized technique in deep learning, particularly in tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Among them, Copy-Paste is a simple yet effective method and gain great attention recently. However, existing Copy-Paste often overlook contextual relevance between source and target images, resulting in inconsistencies in generated outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a context-aware approach that integrates Bidirectional Latent Information Propagation (BLIP) for content extraction from source images. By matching extracted content information with category information, our method ensures cohesive integration of target objects using Segment Anything Model (SAM) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). This approach eliminates the need for manual annotation, offering an automated and user-friendly solution. Experimental evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing data diversity and generating high-quality pseudo-images across various computer vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SpikeCLIP: A Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained Spiking Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06488v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating comparable performance in both visual and linguistic tasks while offering the advantage of improved energy efficiency. Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

| **[Local Clustering for Lung Cancer Image Classification via Sparse Solution Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08800v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose to use a local clustering approach based on the sparse solution technique to study the medical image, especially the lung cancer image classification task. We view images as the vertices in a weighted graph and the similarity between a pair of images as the edges in the graph. The vertices within the same cluster can be assumed to share similar features and properties, thus making the applications of graph clustering techniques very useful for image classification. Recently, the approach based on the sparse solutions of linear systems for graph clustering has been found to identify clusters more efficiently than traditional clustering methods such as spectral clustering. We propose to use the two newly developed local clustering methods based on sparse solution of linear system for image classification. In addition, we employ a box spline-based tight-wavelet-framelet method to clean these images and help build a better adjacency matrix before clustering. The performance of our methods is shown to be very effective in classifying images. Our approach is significantly more efficient and either favorable or equally effective compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we shall make a remark by pointing out two image deformation methods to build up more artificial image data to increase the number of labeled images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[KO: Kinetics-inspired Neural Optimizer with PDE Simulation Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14777v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of optimization algorithms for neural networks remains a critical challenge, with most existing methods relying on heuristic adaptations of gradient-based approaches. This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains comparable.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RadCLIP: Enhancing Radiologic Image Analysis through Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09948v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with radiology marks a transformative era in medicine. Vision foundation models have been adopted to enhance radiologic imaging analysis. However, the distinct complexities of radiologic 2D and 3D radiologic data pose unique challenges that existing models, pre-trained on general non-medical images, fail to address adequately. To bridge this gap and capitalize on the diagnostic precision required in radiologic imaging, we introduce Radiologic Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (RadCLIP): a cross-modal vision-language foundational model that harnesses Vision Language Pre-training (VLP) framework to improve radiologic image analysis. Building upon Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), RadCLIP incorporates a slice pooling mechanism tailored for volumetric image analysis and is pre-trained using a large and diverse dataset of radiologic image-text pairs. The RadCLIP was pre-trained to effectively align radiologic images with their corresponding text annotations, creating a robust vision backbone for radiologic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate RadCLIP's superior performance in both uni-modal radiologic image classification and cross-modal image-text matching, highlighting its significant promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings. Our Key contributions include curating a large dataset with diverse radiologic 2D/3D radiologic image-text pairs, a slice pooling adapter using an attention mechanism for integrating 2D images, and comprehensive evaluations of RadCLIP on various radiologic downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Domain Adaptation for Multi-label Image Classification: a Discriminator-free Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14333v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a discriminator-free adversarial-based approach termed DDA-MLIC for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in the context of Multi-Label Image Classification (MLIC). While recent efforts have explored adversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional discriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the discrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein, we address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly derived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target predictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component. Subsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate an adversarial loss using the Fr\'echet distance. The proposed framework is therefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids the expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method. The proposed method is evaluated on several multi-label image datasets covering three different types of domain shift. The obtained results demonstrate that DDA-MLIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision while requiring a lower number of parameters. The code is made publicly available at github.com/cvi2snt/DDA-MLIC.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at Computer Vision and Image Understanding. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2301.10611</p></details> | [Code Link](http://github.com/cvi2snt/DDA-MLIC) |

Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose \underline{G}reat L\underline{o}R\underline{A} Mixture-of-Exper\underline{t} (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance. Experiments across 25 datasets, including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, image classification, and natural language generation, demonstrate GOAT's state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Intra-class Patch Swap for Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14124v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable technique for compressing large deep learning models into smaller, edge-suitable networks. However, conventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks, which introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage requirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an appropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free distillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many existing approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex training procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on teacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without any auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable parameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective augmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation simulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs of intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying instance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions. Our method is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement, requiring only a single augmentation function. Extensive experiments across image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection show that our method consistently outperforms both existing self-distillation baselines and conventional teacher-based KD approaches. These results suggest that the success of self-distillation could hinge on the design of the augmentation itself.

| **[Making Robust Generalizers Less Rigid with Loss Concentration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03619v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the traditional formulation of machine learning tasks is in terms of performance on average, in practice we are often interested in how well a trained model performs on rare or difficult data points at test time. To achieve more robust and balanced generalization, methods applying sharpness-aware minimization to a subset of worst-case examples have proven successful for image classification tasks, but only using overparameterized neural networks under which the relative difference between "easy" and "hard" data points becomes negligible. In this work, we show how such a strategy can dramatically break down under simpler models where the difficulty gap becomes more extreme. As a more flexible alternative, instead of typical sharpness, we propose and evaluate a training criterion which penalizes poor loss concentration, which can be easily combined with loss transformations such exponential tilting, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), or distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that control tail emphasis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Vision Mamba Across Resolutions via Fractal Traversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14062v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformer-based architectures, offering linear complexity in sequence length while maintaining strong modeling capacity. However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.</p></details> | Work in progressing | None |

While these models offer active interpretability, they often suffer from concept leakages, where unintended information within soft concept representations undermines both interpretability and generalizability. Moreover, most concept-based models focus solely on local explanations (instance-level), neglecting the global decision logic (dataset-level). To address these limitations, we propose Concept Rule Learner (CRL), a novel framework to learn Boolean logical rules from binarized visual concepts. CRL employs logical layers to capture concept correlations and extract clinically meaningful rules, thereby providing both local and global interpretability. Experiments on two medical image classification tasks show that CRL achieves competitive performance with existing methods while significantly improving generalizability to out-of-distribution data.

While metrics such as unlearning accuracy (UA) and membership inference attack (MIA) provide baselines for assessing unlearning performance, they fall short of evaluating the forgetting reliability. In this paper, we find that the data misclassified across UA and MIA still have their ground truth labels included in the prediction set from the uncertainty quantification perspective, which raises a fake unlearning issue. To address this issue, we propose two novel metrics inspired by conformal prediction that more reliably evaluate forgetting quality. Building on these insights, we further propose a conformal prediction-based unlearning framework that integrates conformal prediction into Carlini & Wagner adversarial attack loss, which can significantly push the ground truth label out of the conformal prediction set. Through extensive experiments on image classification task, we demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and the superiority of our unlearning framework, which improves the UA of existing unlearning methods by an average of 6.6% through the incorporation of a tailored loss term alone.</p></details> |  | None |

Although SSMs are not suitable for handling non-causal data, Vision Mamba (ViM) methods still demonstrate good performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection. Recent studies have shown that there is a rich theoretical connection between state space models and attention variants. We propose a novel separable self attention method, for the first time introducing some excellent design concepts of Mamba into separable self-attention. To ensure a fair comparison with ViMs, we introduce VMINet, a simple yet powerful prototype architecture, constructed solely by stacking our novel attention modules with the most basic down-sampling layers. Notably, VMINet differs significantly from the conventional Transformer architecture. Our experiments demonstrate that VMINet has achieved competitive results on image classification and high-resolution dense prediction tasks.Code is available at: https://github.com/yws-wxs/VMINet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/yws-wxs/VMINet) |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on Data Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05657v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data attribution aims to quantify the contribution of individual training data points to the outputs of an AI model, which has been used to measure the value of training data and compensate data providers. Given the impact on financial decisions and compensation mechanisms, a critical question arises concerning the adversarial robustness of data attribution methods. However, there has been little to no systematic research addressing this issue. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by detailing a threat model with clear assumptions about the adversary's goal and capabilities and proposing principled adversarial attack methods on data attribution. We present two methods, Shadow Attack and Outlier Attack, which generate manipulated datasets to inflate the compensation adversarially. The Shadow Attack leverages knowledge about the data distribution in the AI applications, and derives adversarial perturbations through "shadow training", a technique commonly used in membership inference attacks. In contrast, the Outlier Attack does not assume any knowledge about the data distribution and relies solely on black-box queries to the target model's predictions. It exploits an inductive bias present in many data attribution methods - outlier data points are more likely to be influential - and employs adversarial examples to generate manipulated datasets. Empirically, in image classification and text generation tasks, the Shadow Attack can inflate the data-attribution-based compensation by at least 200%, while the Outlier Attack achieves compensation inflation ranging from 185% to as much as 643%.

| **[Synthetic-Powered Predictive Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13432v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification and tabular regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, the Pretrain-Finetuning paradigm has garnered significant attention in recent years, and exploiting pre-trained models could also reduce the requirement of labeled data in downstream tasks. Therefore, a question naturally occurs: \emph{When the labeled data is scarce in the target tasks, should we exploit unlabeled data or pre-trained models?} To answer this question, we select pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as representative pretrain-finetuning instances and propose \textit{Few-shot SSL} -- a framework that enables fair comparison between these two paradigms by controlling the amount of labeled data used. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that pre-trained VLMs generally outperform SSL methods in nearly all cases, except when the data has low resolution or lacks clear semantic structure. Therefore, we encourage future SSL research to compare with pre-trained models and explore deeper integration, such as using pre-trained knowledge to enhance pseudo-labeling. To support future research, we release our unified reproduction and evaluation framework.

Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.</p></details> | <details><summary>L.

| **[Emergence of Fixational and Saccadic Movements in a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model for Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13191v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by foveal vision, hard attention models promise interpretability and parameter economy. However, existing models like the Recurrent Model of Visual Attention (RAM) and Deep Recurrent Attention Model (DRAM) failed to model the hierarchy of human vision system, that compromise on the visual exploration dynamics. As a result, they tend to produce attention that are either overly fixational or excessively saccadic, diverging from human eye movement behavior. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model (MRAM), a novel hard attention framework that explicitly models the neural hierarchy of human visual processing. By decoupling the function of glimpse location generation and task execution in two recurrent layers, MRAM emergent a balanced behavior between fixation and saccadic movement. Our results show that MRAM not only achieves more human-like attention dynamics, but also consistently outperforms CNN, RAM and DRAM baselines on standard image classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

On the one hand, the camera position is arbitrary and objects can appear anywhere in the image, arguing for translation invariance. At the same time, position information is key for exploiting capture/center bias, and scene layout, e.g.: the sky is up. We show that position bias, the level to which a dataset is more easily solved when positional information on input features is used, plays a crucial role in the performance of Vision Transformers image classifiers. To investigate, we propose Position-SHAP, a direct measure of position bias by extending SHAP to work with position embeddings. We show various levels of position bias in different datasets, and find that the optimal choice of position embedding depends on the position bias apparent in the dataset. We therefore propose Auto-PE, a single-parameter position embedding extension, which allows the position embedding to modulate its norm, enabling the unlearning of position information. Auto-PE combines with existing PEs to match or improve accuracy on classification datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

We develop a formal framework for majority-minority learning tasks, showing how standard training can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between ``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and (iii) a lower bound on the additional training required. Our results are illustrated through experiments in deep learning for tabular and image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Toward Relative Positional Encoding in Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16745v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that mimic how neurons in the brain communicate through discrete spikes, which have great potential in various tasks due to their energy efficiency and temporal processing capabilities. SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks, and inspired by traditional Transformers, several studies have demonstrated that spiking absolute positional encoding can help capture sequential relationships for input data, enhancing the capabilities of spiking Transformers for tasks such as sequential modeling and image classification. However, how to incorporate relative positional information into SNNs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce several strategies to approximate relative positional encoding (RPE) in spiking Transformers while preserving the binary nature of spikes. Firstly, we formally prove that encoding relative distances with Gray Code ensures that the binary representations of positional indices maintain a constant Hamming distance whenever their decimal values differ by a power of two, and we propose Gray-PE based on this property. In addition, we propose another RPE method called Log-PE, which combines the logarithmic form of the relative distance matrix directly into the spiking attention map. Furthermore, we extend our RPE methods to a two-dimensional form, making them suitable for processing image patches. We evaluate our RPE methods on various tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification, and the experimental results demonstrate a satisfying performance gain by incorporating our RPE methods across many architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they usually apply single receptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different feature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in medical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing diverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and salient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical image classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often unfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical diagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept, Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields (ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and fairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by applying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different lesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple heterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like structural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the two-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed through comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and generalization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient CNN architectures. The extensive experiments show that our method maintains a better trade-off than state-of-the-art methods in terms of medical image classification, fairness, and computation overhead. The codes of this paper will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

Post-hoc approaches generate explanations for pre-trained models and are compatible with various neural network architectures. These methods often use feature importance visualizations, such as saliency maps, to indicate which input regions influenced the model's prediction. Unfortunately, they typically offer a coarse understanding of the model's decision-making process. In contrast, ante-hoc (inherently explainable) methods rely on specially designed model architectures trained from scratch. A notable subclass of these methods provides explanations through prototypes, representative patches extracted from the training data. However, prototype-based approaches have limitations: they require dedicated architectures, involve specialized training procedures, and perform well only on specific datasets. In this work, we propose EPIC (Explanation of Pretrained Image Classification), a novel approach that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Like post-hoc methods, EPIC operates on pre-trained models without architectural modifications. Simultaneously, it delivers intuitive, prototype-based explanations inspired by ante-hoc techniques. To the best of our knowledge, EPIC is the first post-hoc method capable of fully replicating the core explanatory power of inherently interpretable models. We evaluate EPIC on benchmark datasets commonly used in prototype-based explanations, such as CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars, alongside large-scale datasets like ImageNet, typically employed by post-hoc methods. EPIC uses prototypes to explain model decisions, providing a flexible and easy-to-understand tool for creating clear, high-quality explanations.</p></details> |  | None |

The unlabeled server dataset can either be pre-existing or generated through a data-free approach. The effectiveness of this approach critically depends on the method of assigning weights to client predictions when creating pseudo-labels, especially in highly heterogeneous settings. Inspired by theoretical results from GANs, we propose a provably near-optimal weighting method that leverages client discriminators trained with a server-distributed generator and local datasets. Our experiments on various image classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, we show that the additional communication cost, client-side privacy leakage, and client-side computational overhead introduced by our method are negligible, both in scenarios with and without a pre-existing server dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Poster) at ICML 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Transformers Through Conditioned Embedded Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12789v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have transformed modern machine learning, driving breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. At the core of their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

In image classification tasks, it is common to use data augmentation strategies to increase the robustness of trained networks to changes in the input images and to avoid overfitting. Although data augmentation is a widely adopted technique, the literature lacks a body of research analyzing the effects data augmentation methods have on the patterns learned by neural network models working on complex datasets. The primary objective of this work is to propose a methodology and set of metrics that may allow a quantitative approach to analyzing the effects of data augmentation in convolutional networks applied to image classification. An important tool used in the proposed approach lies in the concept of class activation maps for said models, which allow us to identify and measure the importance these models assign to each individual pixel in an image when executing the classification task. From these maps, we may then extract metrics over the similarities and differences between maps generated by these models trained on a given dataset with different data augmentation strategies. Experiments made using this methodology suggest that the effects of these data augmentation techniques not only can be analyzed in this way but also allow us to identify different impact profiles over the trained models.</p></details> |  | None |

The expanding variety of Pre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for specific tasks. To better reuse the VLM resource and fully leverage its potential on different zero-shot image classification tasks, a promising strategy is selecting appropriate Pre-Trained VLMs from the VLM Zoo, relying solely on the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images. In this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a VLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the "Modality Gap" - the disparity in VLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable substitute for images; and the "Capability Gap" - the discrepancy between the VLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct prediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general performance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the negative impact of two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to capture the relevance between open-source and target datasets with a transportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics of VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging two gaps. By bridging two gaps to obtain better substitutes for test images, SWAB can accurately predict the performance ranking of different VLMs on the target task without the need for the dataset's images. Experiments across various VLMs and image classification datasets validate SWAB's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix typo in figure 2 "Capability Gap"</p></details> | None |

Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently, homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning (MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel, FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Wenchen-Chen/S4L-FSC</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Wenchen-Chen/S4L-FSC) |

While efficient, LoRA constrains updates to a fixed low-rank subspace (Delta W = BA), which can limit representational capacity and hinder downstream performance. We introduce Subspace Recomposition in Low-Rank Adaptation (SRLoRA) via importance-based fusion and reinitialization, a novel approach that enhances LoRA's expressiveness without compromising its lightweight structure. SRLoRA assigns importance scores to each LoRA pair (a column of B and the corresponding row of A), and dynamically recomposes the subspace during training. Less important pairs are fused into the frozen backbone, freeing capacity to reinitialize new pairs along unused principal directions derived from the pretrained weight's singular value decomposition. This mechanism enables continual subspace refreshment and richer adaptation over time, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. We evaluate SRLoRA on both language and vision tasks, including the GLUE benchmark and various image classification datasets. SRLoRA consistently achieves faster convergence and improved accuracy over standard LoRA, demonstrating its generality, efficiency, and potential for broader PEFT applications.</p></details> | Research report | None |

Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures | None |

While existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation, they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations. Extensive experiments across fine-grained, long-tail, few-shot, and background robustness tasks demonstrate our method's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

However, the increasing scale and complexity of modern deep models often exceed the computational or memory capabilities of edge devices. Furthermore, clients may be constrained to use heterogeneous model architectures due to hardware variability (e.g., ASICs, FPGAs) or proprietary requirements that prevent the disclosure or modification of local model structures. These practical considerations motivate the need for model-heterogeneous FL, where clients participate using distinct model architectures. In this work, we propose Generative Model-Aided Federated Learning (GeFL), a framework that enables cross-client knowledge sharing via a generative model trained in a federated manner. This generative model captures global data semantics and facilitates local training without requiring model homogeneity across clients. While GeFL achieves strong performance, empirical analysis reveals limitations in scalability and potential privacy leakage due to generative sample memorization. To address these concerns, we propose GeFL-F, which utilizes feature-level generative modeling. This approach enhances scalability to large client populations and mitigates privacy risks. Extensive experiments across image classification tasks demonstrate that both GeFL and GeFL-F offer competitive performance in heterogeneous settings.

This framework improves the performance of existing Transformer models while providing desirable theoretical guarantees, including generalization and robustness. Our framework is designed to be plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration with established Transformer models and requiring only slight changes to the implementation. We conduct seven extensive experiments on tasks motivated by text generation, sentiment analysis, image classification, and point cloud classification. Experimental results show that the framework improves the test performance of the baselines, while being more parameter-efficient. On character-level text generation with nanoGPT, our framework achieves a 46% reduction in final test loss while using 42% fewer parameters. On GPT-2, our framework achieves a 5.6% reduction in final test loss, demonstrating scalability to larger models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies optimal control theory to both the training and architecture of Transformers.

Due to the large volume of model updates required to be transmitted between clients and the central server, most FL systems are associated with high transfer costs (i.e., communication overhead). This issue is more critical for operational applications in remote sensing (RS), especially when large-scale RS data is processed and analyzed through FL systems with restricted communication bandwidth. To address this issue, we introduce an explanation-guided pruning strategy for communication-efficient FL in the context of RS image classification. Our pruning strategy is defined based on the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) driven explanations to: 1) efficiently and effectively identify the most relevant and informative model parameters (to be exchanged between clients and the central server); and 2) eliminate the non-informative ones to minimize the volume of model updates. The experimental results on the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset demonstrate that our strategy effectively reduces the number of shared model updates, while increasing the generalization ability of the global model.

However, limited research explores if the merging process can occur within one model and enhance the model's robustness, which is particularly critical in the medical image domain. In the paper, we are the first to propose in-model merging (InMerge), a novel approach that enhances the model's robustness by selectively merging similar convolutional kernels in the deep layers of a single convolutional neural network (CNN) during the training process for classification. We also analytically reveal important characteristics that affect how in-model merging should be performed, serving as an insightful reference for the community. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this technique for different CNN architectures on 4 prevalent datasets.

Contrarily, the field of machine unlearning focuses on explicitly forgetting certain previous knowledge from pretrained models when requested, in order to comply with data privacy regulations on the right-to-be-forgotten. Enabling efficient lifelong learning with the capability to selectively unlearn sensitive information from models presents a critical and largely unaddressed challenge with contradicting objectives. We address this problem from the perspective of simultaneously preventing catastrophic forgetting and allowing forward knowledge transfer during task-incremental learning, while ensuring exact task unlearning and minimizing memory requirements, based on a single neural network model to be adapted. Our proposed solution, privacy-aware lifelong learning (PALL), involves optimization of task-specific sparse subnetworks with parameter sharing within a single architecture. We additionally utilize an episodic memory rehearsal mechanism to facilitate exact unlearning without performance degradations. We empirically demonstrate the scalability of PALL across various architectures in image classification, and provide a state-of-the-art solution that uniquely integrates lifelong learning and privacy-aware unlearning mechanisms for responsible AI applications.</p></details> |  | None |

While one line of existing MU methods relies on linear parameter updates via task arithmetic, they suffer from weight entanglement. In this work, we propose a novel MU framework called Mode Connectivity Unlearning (MCU) that leverages mode connectivity to find an unlearning pathway in a nonlinear manner. To further enhance performance and efficiency, we introduce a parameter mask strategy that not only improves unlearning effectiveness but also reduces computational overhead. Moreover, we propose an adaptive adjustment strategy for our unlearning penalty coefficient to adaptively balance forgetting quality and predictive performance during training, eliminating the need for empirical hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional MU methods that identify only a single unlearning model, MCU uncovers a spectrum of unlearning models along the pathway. Overall, MCU serves as a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with any existing MU methods, consistently improving unlearning efficacy. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate that MCU achieves superior performance.</p></details> |  | None |

While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP outdo in multimodal representation, their capacity for AI-generated image classification is underexplored due to the absence of such labels during the pre-training process. This work investigates whether CLIP embeddings inherently contain information indicative of AI generation. A proposed pipeline extracts visual embeddings using a frozen CLIP model, feeds its embeddings to lightweight networks, and fine-tunes only the final classifier. Experiments on the public CIFAKE benchmark show the performance reaches 95% accuracy without language reasoning. Few-shot adaptation to curated custom with 20% of the data results in performance to 85%. A closed-source baseline (Gemini-2.0) has the best zero-shot accuracy yet fails on specific styles. Notably, some specific image types, such as wide-angle photographs and oil paintings, pose significant challenges to classification.

| **[Quantum-Enhanced Parameter-Efficient Learning for Typhoon Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09395v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typhoon trajectory forecasting is essential for disaster preparedness but remains computationally demanding due to the complexity of atmospheric dynamics and the resource requirements of deep learning models. Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient approximation of Earth Mover's Distance Based on Nearest Neighbor Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07378v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is an important similarity measure between two distributions, used in computer vision and many other application domains. However, its exact calculation is computationally and memory intensive, which hinders its scalability and applicability for large-scale problems. Various approximate EMD algorithms have been proposed to reduce computational costs, but they suffer lower accuracy and may require additional memory usage or manual parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a novel approach, NNS-EMD, to approximate EMD using Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS), in order to achieve high accuracy, low time complexity, and high memory efficiency. The NNS operation reduces the number of data points compared in each NNS iteration and offers opportunities for parallel processing. We further accelerate NNS-EMD via vectorization on GPU, which is especially beneficial for large datasets. We compare NNS-EMD with both the exact EMD and state-of-the-art approximate EMD algorithms on image classification and retrieval tasks. We also apply NNS-EMD to calculate transport mapping and realize color transfer between images. NNS-EMD can be 44x to 135x faster than the exact EMD implementation, and achieves superior accuracy, speedup, and memory efficiency over existing approximate EMD methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In data-scarce settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PrePrompt: Predictive prompting for class incremental learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08586v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) based on pre-trained models offers a promising direction for open-world continual learning. Existing methods typically rely on correlation-based strategies, where an image's classification feature is used as a query to retrieve the most related key prompts and select the corresponding value prompts for training. However, these approaches face an inherent limitation: fitting the entire feature space of all tasks with only a few trainable prompts is fundamentally challenging. We propose Predictive Prompting (PrePrompt), a novel CIL framework that circumvents correlation-based limitations by leveraging pre-trained models' natural classification ability to predict task-specific prompts. Specifically, PrePrompt decomposes CIL into a two-stage prediction framework: task-specific prompt prediction followed by label prediction. While theoretically appealing, this framework risks bias toward recent classes due to missing historical data for older classifier calibration. PrePrompt then mitigates this by incorporating feature translation, dynamically balancing stability and plasticity. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate PrePrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art prompt-based CIL methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 29 figures, conference</p></details> | None |

As in the traditional neural network, the convolutional layers form informational "features" used as predictors in the SNN-based classifier with CoLaNET architecture.

Our goal is to reduce inference latency and model complexity with acceptable accuracy degradation.

| **[Empowering Vision Transformers with Multi-Scale Causal Intervention for Long-Tailed Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08173v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate long-tail classification by handling the biases introduced by class imbalance. However, along with the change of advanced backbone models from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Visual Transformers (ViT), existing causal models may not achieve an expected performance gain. This paper investigates the influence of existing causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global feature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations between fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in classifying tail classes with similar visual appearance. To address these issues, this paper proposes TSCNet, a two-stage causal modeling method to discover fine-grained causal associations through multi-scale causal interventions. Specifically, in the hierarchical causal representation learning stage (HCRL), it decouples the background and objects, applying backdoor interventions at both the patch and feature level to prevent model from using class-irrelevant areas to infer labels which enhances fine-grained causal representation. In the counterfactual logits bias calibration stage (CLBC), it refines the optimization of model's decision boundary by adaptive constructing counterfactual balanced data distribution to remove the spurious associations in the logits caused by data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on various long-tail benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSCNet can eliminate multiple biases introduced by data imbalance, which outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MoKD: Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08170v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compact models can be effectively trained through Knowledge Distillation (KD), a technique that transfers knowledge from larger, high-performing teacher models. Two key challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD) are: 1) balancing learning from the teacher's guidance and the task objective, and 2) handling the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models. To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation (MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space, improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, MoKD models also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to models trained from scratch.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Sparse Attention Framework for Computationally Efficient Classification of Biological Cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07661v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SparseAttnNet, a new hierarchical attention-driven framework for efficient image classification that adaptively selects and processes only the most informative pixels from images. Traditional convolutional neural networks typically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading to computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our approach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention distilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model, allowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k is adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once the top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding them as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by multi-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images, we demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels instead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white blood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD) images from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from motion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield microscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities, SparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing computational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point operations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers. Since the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers improved explainability. The adaptive and lightweight nature of SparseAttnNet makes it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained and high-throughput settings, including imaging flow cytometry.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset generalization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking in RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking is crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT without thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate No-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types. Experimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or matches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may hinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate this effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to explore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an Adaptive-Thinking method. Experiments show that it converges to a specific prompt depending on model capability and task complexity, achieving comparable or better performance than both Thinking and No-Thinking-RL. This suggests MLLMs can adaptively decide to think or not based on their capabilities and task complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress.

Computer vision (CV) has become a popular solution for these inspections due to its cost-effectiveness and reliability. However, CV models require large, annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. To reduce the need for extensive training data, we propose a novel image classification pipeline that combines similarity search using a vision-based foundation model with synthetic data. Our approach leverages a DINOv2 model to transform input images into feature vectors, which are then compared to pre-classified reference images using cosine distance measurements. By utilizing synthetic data instead of real images as references, our pipeline achieves high classification accuracy without relying on real data. We evaluate this approach in eight real-world inspection scenarios and demonstrate that it meets the high performance requirements of production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Procedia CIRP</p></details> | None |
| **[Discovering Fine-Grained Visual-Concept Relations by Disentangled Optimal Transport Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07209v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) try to make the decision-making process transparent by exploring an intermediate concept space between the input image and the output prediction. Existing CBMs just learn coarse-grained relations between the whole image and the concepts, less considering local image information, leading to two main drawbacks: i) they often produce spurious visual-concept relations, hence decreasing model reliability; and ii) though CBMs could explain the importance of every concept to the final prediction, it is still challenging to tell which visual region produces the prediction. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Disentangled Optimal Transport CBM (DOT-CBM) framework to explore fine-grained visual-concept relations between local image patches and concepts. Specifically, we model the concept prediction process as a transportation problem between the patches and concepts, thereby achieving explicit fine-grained feature alignment. We also incorporate orthogonal projection losses within the modality to enhance local feature disentanglement. To further address the shortcut issues caused by statistical biases in the data, we utilize the visual saliency map and concept label statistics as transportation priors. Thus, DOT-CBM can visualize inversion heatmaps, provide more reliable concept predictions, and produce more accurate class predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DOT-CBM achieves SOTA performance on several tasks, including image classification, local part detection and out-of-distribution generalization.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000 image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant disease diagnostics.

Existing solutions fall short as they rely on untargeted random, model- or latent-based perturbations, due to difficulties in generating controlled input variations. In this work, we introduce Mimicry, a novel black-box test generator for fine-grained, targeted exploration of DL system boundaries. Mimicry performs boundary testing by leveraging the probabilistic nature of DL outputs to identify promising directions for exploration. It uses style-based GANs to disentangle input representations into content and style components, enabling controlled feature mixing to approximate the decision boundary. We evaluated Mimicry's effectiveness in generating boundary inputs for five widely used DL image classification systems of increasing complexity, comparing it to two baseline approaches. Our results show that Mimicry consistently identifies inputs closer to the decision boundary. It generates semantically meaningful boundary test cases that reveal new functional (mis)behaviors, while the baselines produce mainly corrupted or invalid inputs. Thanks to its enhanced control over latent space manipulations, Mimicry remains effective as dataset complexity increases, maintaining competitive diversity and higher validity rates, confirmed by human assessors.</p></details> |  | None |

Using active learning, we can reduce the number of training examples to teach a CNN classifier by strategically selecting examples. Assigning values to image examples using different uncertainty metrics allows the model to identify and select high-value examples in a smaller training set size. We demonstrate results for digit recognition and fruit classification on the MNIST and Fruits360 data sets. We formally compare results for four different uncertainty metrics. Finally, we observe active learning is also effective on simpler (binary) classification tasks, but marked improvement from random sampling is more evident on more difficult tasks. We show active learning is a viable algorithm for image classification problems.</p></details> |  | None |

A proper temporal supervision may further improve the network training performance. Inspired by this observation, we propose Temporal Supervised Knowledge Distillation (TSKD). Specifically, we extract the spatiotemporal features in the different training phases of student by convolutional Long Short-term memory network (Conv-LSTM). Then, we train the student net through a dynamic target, rather than static teacher network features.

However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, effectively adapting such models for medical image classification is still a less explored topic. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to adapt SAM for medical image classification. First, we utilize the SAM image encoder as a feature extractor to capture segmentation-based features that convey important spatial and contextual details of the image, while freezing its weights to avoid unnecessary overhead during training. Next, we propose a novel Spatially Localized Channel Attention (SLCA) mechanism to compute spatially localized attention weights for the feature maps. The features extracted from SAM's image encoder are processed through SLCA to compute attention weights, which are then integrated into deep learning classification models to enhance their focus on spatially relevant or meaningful regions of the image, thus improving classification performance. Experimental results on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and data-efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gradient-Guided Annealing for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20162v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) research has gained considerable traction as of late, since the ability to generalize to unseen data distributions is a requirement that eludes even state-of-the-art training algorithms. In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in CVPR2025</p></details> | None |

However, their implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remains challenging due to hardware limitations. In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to directly process $28\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum processor, achieving $96.08\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the $71.74\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training conditions. These results represent one of the first implementations of image classifications on real quantum hardware and validate the potential of quantum computing in this area.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a new set of models that build on these advancements by incorporating a new set of attention mechanisms that combines Triplet attention with Squeeze-and-Excitation (TripSE) in four different variants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of \textbf{78.27\%} on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Gradient Clipping for Robust Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14432v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust federated learning aims to maintain reliable performance despite the presence of adversarial or misbehaving workers. While state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust distributed gradient descent (Robust-DGD) methods were proven theoretically optimal, their empirical success has often relied on pre-aggregation gradient clipping. However, existing static clipping strategies yield inconsistent results: enhancing robustness against some attacks while being ineffective or even detrimental against others. To address this limitation, we propose a principled adaptive clipping strategy, Adaptive Robust Clipping (ARC), which dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on the input gradients. We prove that ARC not only preserves the theoretical robustness guarantees of SOTA Robust-DGD methods but also provably improves asymptotic convergence when the model is well-initialized. Extensive experiments on benchmark image classification tasks confirm these theoretical insights, demonstrating that ARC significantly enhances robustness, particularly in highly heterogeneous and adversarial settings.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we integrate Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) into the KAN framework to transform multi-class classification into multiple binary tasks, improving robustness via Hamming-distance decoding. Our proposed KAN with ECOC method outperforms vanilla KAN on a challenging blood cell classification dataset, achieving higher accuracy under diverse hyperparameter settings. Ablation studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of ECOC with KAN for enhancing multi-class medical image classification performance.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |

Previous work in constructing sparse approximate inverse Cholesky factors of such matrices by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence recovers the Vecchia approximation for Gaussian processes. These methods rely only on the geometry of the evaluation points to construct the sparsity pattern. In this work, we instead construct the sparsity pattern by leveraging a greedy selection algorithm that maximizes mutual information with target points, conditional on all points previously selected. For selecting $k$ points out of $N$, the naive time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N k^4)$, but by maintaining a partial Cholesky factor we reduce this to $\mathcal{O}(N k^2)$. Furthermore, for multiple ($m$) targets we achieve a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N k^2 + N m^2 + m^3)$, which is maintained in the setting of aggregated Cholesky factorization where a selected point need not condition every target. We apply the selection algorithm to image classification and recovery of sparse Cholesky factors. By minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence, we apply the algorithm to Cholesky factorization, Gaussian process regression, and preconditioning with the conjugate gradient, improving over $k$-nearest neighbors selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SIAM JUQ</p></details> | None |

Existing recognition methods often ignore structural information of image data or depend heavily on the sample size of image data. To address this issue, we develop a novel variational Bayesian method for image classification in a logistic tensor regression model with image tensor predictors by utilizing tensor decomposition to approximate tensor regression. To handle the sparsity of tensor coefficients, we introduce the multiway shrinkage priors for marginal factor vectors of tensor coefficients. In particular, we obtain a closed-form approximation to the variational posteriors for classification prediction based on the matricization of tensor decomposition. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methodologies in terms of accuracy, precision and F1 score. Flower image data and chest X-ray image data are illustrated by the proposed methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Taking heed of these limitations, we investigated in-context learning as a pragmatic alternative to model retraining by allowing models to adapt to new diagnostic tasks using only a few labeled examples at inference, without the need for retraining. Using four vision-language models (VLMs)-Paligemma, CLIP, ALIGN and GPT-4o, we evaluated the performance across three oncology datasets: MHIST, PatchCamelyon and HAM10000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the performance of multiple VLMs on different oncology classification tasks. Without any parameter updates, all models showed significant gains with few-shot prompting, with GPT-4o reaching an F1 score of 0.81 in binary classification and 0.60 in multi-class classification settings. While these results remain below the ceiling of fully fine-tuned systems, they highlight the potential of ICL to approximate task-specific behavior using only a handful of examples, reflecting how clinicians often reason from prior cases. Notably, open-source models like Paligemma and CLIP demonstrated competitive gains despite their smaller size, suggesting feasibility for deployment in computing constrained clinical environments. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of ICL as a practical solution in oncology, particularly for rare cancers and resource-limited contexts where fine-tuning is infeasible and annotated data is difficult to obtain.</p></details> |  | None |

Renowned for their exceptional accuracy, these models have become a standard for image classification tasks across diverse computer vision benchmarks. While traditional neural networks learn correlations between feature channels during training, vector-valued neural networks inherently treat multidimensional data as coherent entities, taking for granted the inter-channel relationships. This paper introduces vector-valued EfficientNets (V-EfficientNets), a novel extension of EfficientNet designed to process arbitrary vector-valued data. The proposed models are evaluated on a medical image classification task, achieving an average accuracy of 99.46% on the ALL-IDB2 dataset for detecting acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

For transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities. Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Biomed-DPT: Dual Modality Prompt Tuning for Biomedical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05189v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

Fine-tuning these models on domain-specific datasets further enhances their effectiveness for downstream applications. However, fine-tuning in cloud environments raises significant concerns regarding data security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution by enabling model training across local clients without centralizing sensitive data, but the high communication and computation costs of transmitting full pre-trained models during training limit its scalability. Additionally, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across local clients can negatively impact model convergence and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CacheFL, a novel federated learning method that replaces traditional full model fine-tuning with lightweight cache model fine-tuning. The cache model is initialized using a class-balanced dataset generated by a generative pre-trained model, effectively mitigating the impact of non-IID data. This cache model is then distributed to local clients for fine-tuning, and the updated parameters from each client are aggregated on the server and redistributed. With the updated cache model, the classification performance of CLIP is improved after just a few epochs. By limiting the training and communication to the cache model, CacheFL significantly reduces resource demands while ensuring data privacy and security. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and 10 additional datasets demonstrate that CacheFL outperforms traditional approaches in terms of classification accuracy, resource efficiency, and privacy preservation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Direct Image Classification from Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy Measurements without Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05054v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.</p></details> | ISCS 2025 | None |

Despite its growing popularity, FL faces challenges in preserving the privacy of local datasets, its sensitivity to poisoning attacks by malicious users, and its communication overhead. The latter is additionally considerably dominant in large-scale networks. These limitations are often individually mitigated by local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, robust aggregation, compression, and user selection techniques, which typically come at the cost of accuracy. In this work, we present compressed private aggregation (CPA), that allows massive deployments to simultaneously communicate at extremely low bit rates while achieving privacy, anonymity, and resilience to malicious users. CPA randomizes a codebook for compressing the data into a few bits using nested lattice quantizers, while ensuring anonymity and robustness, with a subsequent perturbation to hold LDP. The proposed CPA is proven to result in FL convergence in the same asymptotic rate as FL without privacy, compression, and robustness considerations, while satisfying both anonymity and LDP requirements. These analytical properties are empirically confirmed in a numerical study, where we demonstrate the performance gains of CPA compared with separate mechanisms for compression and privacy for training different image classification models, as well as its robustness in mitigating the harmful effects of malicious users.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.10888</p></details> | None |

However, since samples vary in difficulty, a dynamic model that adapts computation based on sample complexity offers a novel perspective for compression and scaling. Despite this potential, existing dynamic models are typically monolithic and model-specific, limiting their generalizability as broad compression and scaling methods. Additionally, most deployed DL systems are fixed, unable to adjust their scale once deployed and, therefore, cannot adapt to the varying real-time demands. This paper introduces DyCE, a dynamically configurable system that can adjust the performance-complexity trade-off of a DL model at runtime without requiring re-initialization or redeployment on inference hardware. DyCE achieves this by adding small exit networks to intermediate layers of the original model, allowing computation to terminate early if acceptable results are obtained. DyCE also decouples the design of an efficient dynamic model, facilitating easy adaptation to new base models and potential general use in compression and scaling. We also propose methods for generating optimized configurations and determining the types and positions of exit networks to achieve desired performance and complexity trade-offs. By enabling simple configuration switching, DyCE provides fine-grained performance tuning in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCE through image classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DyCE significantly reduces computational complexity by 23.5% for ResNet152 and 25.9% for ConvNextv2-tiny on ImageNet, with accuracy reductions of less than 0.5%.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging a collection of pre-trained experts with diverse computational costs and performance levels, ORXE dynamically adjusts inference pathways based on the complexity of input samples. Unlike conventional approaches that require complex metamodel training, ORXE achieves high efficiency and flexibility without complicating the development process. The proposed system utilizes a confidence-based gating mechanism to allocate appropriate computational resources for each input. ORXE also supports adjustments to the preference between inference cost and prediction performance across a wide range during runtime. We implemented a training-free ORXE system for image classification tasks, evaluating its efficiency and accuracy across various devices. The results demonstrate that ORXE achieves superior performance compared to individual experts and other dynamic models in most cases.

However, its utility is often limited by the difficulty of tuning and stabilizing these exponents. We propose 2SED Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (2SEDFOSGD), which integrates the Two-Scale Effective Dimension (2SED) algorithm with FOSGD to adapt the fractional exponent in a data-driven manner. By tracking model sensitivity and effective dimensionality, 2SEDFOSGD dynamically modulates the exponent to mitigate oscillations and hasten convergence. Theoretically, this approach preserves the advantages of fractional memory without the sluggish or unstable behavior observed in na\"ive fractional SGD. Empirical evaluations in Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable noise scenarios using an autoregressive (AR) model\textcolor{red}{, as well as on the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets for image classification,} highlight faster convergence and more robust parameter estimates compared to baseline methods, underscoring the potential of dimension-aware fractional techniques for advanced modeling and estimation tasks.</p></details> | IEEE L-CSS submitted | None |

Current research primarily focuses on reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse photon events, whereas the semantic interpretation of single-photon images remains underexplored, due to high annotation costs and inefficient labeling strategies. This paper presents the first active learning framework for single-photon image classification. The core contribution is an imaging condition-aware sampling strategy that integrates synthetic augmentation to model variability across imaging conditions. By identifying samples where the model is both uncertain and sensitive to these conditions, the proposed method selectively annotates only the most informative examples. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms all baselines and achieves high classification accuracy with significantly fewer labeled samples. Specifically, our approach achieves 97% accuracy on synthetic single-photon data using only 1.5% labeled samples. On real-world data, we maintain 90.63% accuracy with just 8% labeled samples, which is 4.51% higher than the best-performing baseline. This illustrates that active learning enables the same level of classification performance on single-photon images as on classical images, opening doors to large-scale integration of single-photon data in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Although FedAvg pioneered synchronous rounds for global model averaging, slower devices can delay collective progress. Asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync) addresses stragglers by continuously integrating client updates, yet naive implementations risk client drift due to non-IID data and stale contributions. Some Blockchain-based FL approaches (e.g., BRAIN) employ robust weighting or scoring of updates to resist malicious or misaligned proposals. However, performance drops can still persist under severe data heterogeneity or high staleness, and synchronization overhead has emerged as a new concern due to its aggregator-free architectures. We introduce Fast-and-Reliable AI Network, FRAIN, a new asynchronous FL method that mitigates these limitations by incorporating two key ideas. First, our FastSync strategy eliminates the need to replay past model versions, enabling newcomers and infrequent participants to efficiently approximate the global model. Second, we adopt spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) when merging parameters, preserving models' directions and alleviating destructive interference from divergent local training. Experiments with a CNN image-classification model and a Transformer-based language model demonstrate that FRAIN achieves more stable and robust convergence than FedAvg, FedAsync, and BRAIN, especially under harsh environments: non-IID data distributions, networks that experience delays and require frequent re-synchronization, and the presence of malicious nodes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional supervised deep learning models depend on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often limited in medical imaging. Recently, Vision-Language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has been applied to image classifications. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), which classifiers image based on visual information only, VLM leverages multimodal learning with text and images, allowing it to learn effectively even with a limited amount of labeled data. Inspired by CLIP, we pro-pose a Liver-VLM, a model specifically designed for focal liver lesions (FLLs) classification. First, Liver-VLM incorporates class information into the text encoder without introducing additional inference overhead. Second, by calculating the pairwise cosine similarities between image and text embeddings and optimizing the model with a cross-entropy loss, Liver-VLM ef-fectively aligns image features with class-level text features. Experimental results on MPCT-FLLs dataset demonstrate that the Liver-VLM model out-performs both the standard CLIP and MedCLIP models in terms of accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Further analysis shows that using a lightweight ResNet18 backbone enhances classification performance, particularly under data-constrained conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,4 figures, 4 tables,Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare Proceedings of 13th KES-InMed 2025</p></details> | None |

Five state-of-the-art architectures - MobileNetV3 Small, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and ShuffleNetV2 - are benchmarked across three diverse datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet.

Our findings reveal that transfer learning significantly enhances model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet. EfficientNetV2 consistently achieves the highest accuracy, while MobileNetV3 offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, and SqueezeNet excels in inference speed and compactness. This study highlights critical trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, offering actionable insights for deploying lightweight models in real-world applications where computational resources are limited.

This is achieved by inducing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm can limit the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between invariance-related tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we introduce \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling paradigm based on joint-embedding predictive architecture that leverages architectural inductive biases to resolve this trade-off. Without requiring an additional equivariance predictor or loss term, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to the specified transformations and another invariant to them and suited for tasks such as classification. To do so, our model processes a short sequence of different views (observations) of an input image. Each encoded view is concatenated with embeddings corresponding to the relative transformation (action) producing the next observation in the sequence. A transformer encoder outputs an aggregate representation of this sequence, which is subsequently conditioned on the action leading to the next observation to predict its representation. Empirically, seq-JEPA achieves strong performance on equivariant benchmarks and image classification without sacrificing one for the other. Additionally, our framework excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from 78 percent to 93 percent when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Computer and Decision Making An International Journal (COMDEM)</p></details> | None |

This scheme, however, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, when some of the clients submit corrupted model updates. In real-world scenarios, the total number of compromised clients is typically unknown, with the extent of attacks potentially varying over time. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive approach for robust aggregation of model updates based on Bayesian inference. The mean update is defined by the maximum of the likelihood marginalized over probabilities of each client to be `honest'. As a result, the method shares the simplicity of the classical average estimators (e.g., sample mean or geometric median), being independent of the number of compromised clients. At the same time, it is as effective against attacks as methods specifically tailored to Federated Learning, such as Krum. We compare our approach with other aggregation schemes in federated setting on three benchmark image classification data sets. The proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various attack types with static and varying number of malicious clients.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

This popularity increases the importance of considering the security of MoE architectures. Unfortunately, the security of models using a MoE architecture has not yet gained much attention compared to other DNN models. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of patch-based MoE (pMoE) models for image classification against backdoor attacks. We examine multiple trigger generation methods and Fine-Pruning as a defense. To better understand a pMoE model's vulnerability to backdoor attacks, we investigate which factors affect the model's patch selection. Our work shows that pMoE models are highly susceptible to backdoor attacks. More precisely, we achieve high attack success rates of up to 100% with visible triggers and a 2% poisoning rate, whilst only having a clean accuracy drop of 1.0%. Additionally, we show that pruning itself is ineffective as a defense but that fine-tuning can remove the backdoor almost completely. Our results show that fine-tuning the model for five epochs reduces the attack success rate to 2.1% whilst sacrificing 1.4% accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

It has the ability to improve the final model's performance and accelerate the training process. However, in the medical imaging domain, data irregularities can make the recognition task more challenging and usually result in misclassification between the different classes in the dataset. Class-decomposition approaches have shown promising results in solving such a problem by learning the boundaries within the classes of the data set. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) training method based on the curriculum learning strategy and the class decomposition approach, which we call CLOG-CD, to improve the performance of medical image classification. We evaluated our method on four different imbalanced medical image datasets, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), brain tumour, digital knee X-ray, and histopathology colorectal cancer (CRC). CLOG-CD utilises the learnt weights from the decomposition granularity of the classes, and the training is accomplished from descending to ascending order (i.e., anti-curriculum technique). We also investigated the classification performance of our proposed method based on different acceleration factors and pace function curricula. We used two pre-trained networks, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121, as the backbone for CLOG-CD. The results with ResNet-50 show that CLOG-CD has the ability to improve classification performance with an accuracy of 96.08% for the CXR dataset, 96.91% for the brain tumour dataset, 79.76% for the digital knee X-ray, and 99.17% for the CRC dataset, compared to other training strategies. In addition, with DenseNet-121, CLOG-CD has achieved 94.86%, 94.63%, 76.19%, and 99.45% for CXR, brain tumour, digital knee X-ray, and CRC datasets, respectively</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing</p></details> | None |
| **[TActiLE: Tiny Active LEarning for wearable devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01160v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithms have seen extensive use in recent years, enabling wearable devices to be not only connected but also genuinely intelligent by running machine learning (ML) computations directly on-device. Among such devices, smart glasses have particularly benefited from TinyML advancements. TinyML facilitates the on-device execution of the inference phase of ML algorithms on embedded and wearable devices, and more recently, it has expanded into On-device Learning (ODL), which allows both inference and learning phases to occur directly on the device. The application of ODL techniques to wearable devices is particularly compelling, as it enables the development of more personalized models that adapt based on the data of the user. However, one of the major challenges of ODL algorithms is the scarcity of labeled data collected on-device. In smart wearable contexts, requiring users to manually label large amounts of data is often impractical and could lead to user disengagement with the technology. To address this issue, this paper explores the application of Active Learning (AL) techniques, i.e., techniques that aim at minimizing the labeling effort, by actively selecting from a large quantity of unlabeled data only a small subset to be labeled and added to the training set of the algorithm. In particular, we propose TActiLE, a novel AL algorithm that selects from the stream of on-device sensor data the ones that would help the ML algorithm improve the most once coupled with labels provided by the user. TActiLE is the first Active Learning technique specifically designed for the TinyML context. We evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency through experiments on multiple image classification datasets. The results demonstrate its suitability for tiny and wearable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the "Eyes Of The Future: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Smart Eyewear (IAISE)" Workshop, Held at the "International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025"</p></details> | None |

Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact.

In computer vision, the attention mechanism was first incorporated in the Vision Transformer ViT, and then its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While the attention mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the disadvantage of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more attempts with different sets of advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block. The newly proposed block reduces the computational requirements by replacing the normal attention layers with a Network in Network structure, therefore enhancing the static approach of the MLP-Mixer with a dynamic learning of element-wise gating function generated by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Comput & Applic (2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Interpretability-Aware Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08035v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become prominent models for solving various vision tasks. However, the interpretability of ViTs has not kept pace with their promising performance. While there has been a surge of interest in developing {\it post hoc} solutions to explain ViTs' outputs, these methods do not generalize to different downstream tasks and various transformer architectures. Furthermore, if ViTs are not properly trained with the given data and do not prioritize the region of interest, the {\it post hoc} methods would be less effective. Instead of developing another {\it post hoc} approach, we introduce a novel training procedure that inherently enhances model interpretability. Our interpretability-aware ViT (IA-ViT) draws inspiration from a fresh insight: both the class patch and image patches consistently generate predicted distributions and attention maps. IA-ViT is composed of a feature extractor, a predictor, and an interpreter, which are trained jointly with an interpretability-aware training objective. Consequently, the interpreter simulates the behavior of the predictor and provides a faithful explanation through its single-head self-attention mechanism. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IA-ViT in several image classification tasks, with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of model performance and interpretability.

Initial works on ``exact'' unlearning (e.g., retraining) incur large computational overheads. However, while computationally inexpensive, ``approximate'' methods have fallen short of reaching the effectiveness of exact unlearning: models produced fail to obtain comparable accuracy and prediction confidence on both the forget and test (i.e., unseen) dataset. Exploiting this observation, we propose a new unlearning method, Adversarial Machine UNlearning (AMUN), that outperforms prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for image classification. AMUN lowers the confidence of the model on the forget samples by fine-tuning the model on their corresponding adversarial examples. Adversarial examples naturally belong to the distribution imposed by the model on the input space; fine-tuning the model on the adversarial examples closest to the corresponding forget samples (a) localizes the changes to the decision boundary of the model around each forget sample and (b) avoids drastic changes to the global behavior of the model, thereby preserving the model's accuracy on test samples. Using AMUN for unlearning a random $10\%$ of CIFAR-10 samples, we observe that even SOTA membership inference attacks cannot do better than random guessing.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

This paper introduces the information theoretic principle of Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) to LLM fine-tuning for classification tasks, exploring its promise in two main ways: minimizing CMI to improve a model's standalone performance and maximizing CMI to enhance knowledge distillation (KD) for more capable student models. To apply CMI in LLM fine-tuning, we adapt the recently proposed CMI-constrained deep learning framework, which was initially developed for image classification, with some modification. By minimizing CMI during LLM fine-tuning, we achieve superior performance gains on 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to BERT. Additionally, maximizing CMI during the KD process results in significant performance improvements in 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to DistilBERT. These findings demonstrate CMI's adaptability for optimizing both standalone LLMs and student models, showcasing its potential as a robust framework for advancing LLM fine-tuning. Our work bridges the gap between information theory and LLM development, offering new insights for building high-performing language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, Published to IEEE ISIT 2025</p></details> | None |

Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, which prevents them from learning from each other. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions within a single transformer. EgoAgent introduces two innovations to learn from the causal and temporally intertwined nature of these abilities: (1) Interleaved sequential modeling of states and actions with the causal attention mechanism, and (2) A joint embedding-action-prediction architecture featuring temporal asymmetric predictor-observer branches. Integrating these designs based on JEPA, EgoAgent unifies these capabilities in a cohesive learning framework. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.

However, existing Mamba-based methods usually neglect the spectral and spatial directional characteristics related to heterogeneous objects in hyperspectral scenes, leading to limited classification performance. To address these issues, we propose MambaMoE, a novel spectral-spatial mixture-of-experts framework, representing the first MoE-based approach in the HSI classification community. Specifically, we design a Mixture of Mamba Expert Block (MoMEB) that leverages sparse expert activation to enable adaptive spectral-spatial modeling. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-guided corrective learning (UGCL) strategy to encourage the model's attention toward complex regions prone to prediction ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple public HSI benchmarks demonstrate that MambaMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing advanced approaches, especially for Mamba-based methods.

Existing methods select Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data as backdoor watermarks and retrain the original model for copyright protection. However, existing methods are susceptible to malicious detection and forgery by adversaries, resulting in watermark evasion. In this work, we propose Model-\underline{ag}nostic Black-box Backdoor W\underline{ate}rmarking Framework (AGATE) to address stealthiness and robustness challenges in multimodal model copyright protection. Specifically, we propose an adversarial trigger generation method to generate stealthy adversarial triggers from ordinary dataset, providing visual fidelity while inducing semantic shifts. To alleviate the issue of anomaly detection among model outputs, we propose a post-transform module to correct the model output by narrowing the distance between adversarial trigger image embedding and text embedding. Subsequently, a two-phase watermark verification is proposed to judge whether the current model infringes by comparing the two results with and without the transform module. Consequently, we consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods across five datasets in the downstream tasks of multimodal image-text retrieval and image classification. Additionally, we validated the robustness of AGATE under two adversarial attack scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Remote sensing surveys complement field-based approaches, and their reach can be especially great when combined with deep learning and computer vision techniques. However, conventional supervised deep learning methods face challenges in annotating fine-grained archaeological features at scale. While recent vision foundation models have shown remarkable success in learning large-scale remote sensing data with minimal annotations, most off-the-shelf solutions are designed for RGB images rather than multi-spectral satellite imagery, such as the 8-band data used in our study. In this paper, we introduce DeepAndes, a transformer-based vision foundation model trained on three million multi-spectral satellite images, specifically tailored for Andean archaeology. DeepAndes incorporates a customized DINOv2 self-supervised learning algorithm optimized for 8-band multi-spectral imagery, marking the first foundation model designed explicitly for the Andes region. We evaluate its image understanding performance through imbalanced image classification, image instance retrieval, and pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that DeepAndes achieves superior F1 scores, mean average precision, and Dice scores in few-shot learning scenarios, significantly outperforming models trained from scratch or pre-trained on smaller datasets. This underscores the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training in archaeological remote sensing.

Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

These methods construct graphs where image patches serve as nodes, and edges are established based on patch similarity or classification relevance. Despite their efficiency, the explainability of GNN-based vision models remains underexplored, even though graphs are naturally interpretable. In this work, we analyze the semantic consistency of the graphs formed at different layers of GNN-based image classifiers, focusing on how well they preserve object structures and meaningful relationships. A comprehensive analysis is presented by quantifying the extent to which inter-layer graph connections reflect semantic similarity and spatial coherence. Explanations from standard and adversarial settings are also compared to assess whether they reflect the classifiers' robustness. Additionally, we visualize the flow of information across layers through heatmap-based visualization techniques, thereby highlighting the models' explainability. Our findings demonstrate that the decision-making processes of these models can be effectively explained, while also revealing that their reasoning does not necessarily align with human perception, especially in deeper layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, accepted for presentation at xAI-World-Conference 2025, code is available at https://github.com/nickhaidos/Vision-GNNs-Explainer</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/nickhaidos/Vision-GNNs-Explainer) |

It can be achieved through instruction set extensions and corresponding custom functional units. Yet, efficiently exploiting these opportunities requires a hardware/software co-design approach in which the DNN model, software, and hardware are designed together. In this paper, we propose novel RISC-V extensions for accelerating DNN models containing semi-structured and unstructured sparsity. While the idea of accelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design offers various advantages over other designs. To exploit semi-structured sparsity, we take advantage of the fine-grained (bit-level) configurability of FPGAs and suggest reserving a few bits in a block of DNN weights to encode the information about sparsity in the succeeding blocks. The proposed custom functional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit unstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential multiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the non-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured pruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4, respectively. We then propose a combined design that can accelerate both types of sparsities, providing speedups of up to a factor of 5. Our designs consume a small amount of additional FPGA resources such that the resulting co-designs enable the acceleration of DNNs even on small FPGAs. We benchmark our designs on standard TinyML applications such as keyword spotting, image classification, and person detection.</p></details> |  | None |

The study presents experiments on training specialists for image classification and object detection tasks. The results demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy even without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by constraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying traditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically coherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is proposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the evolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to future research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image analysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input. Additionally, the proposed methods can help improve system performance in scenarios where certain data domains should be excluded from consideration of the generalist network.</p></details> |  | None |

Its architectural flexibility and capabilities have made it a preferred choice among researchers and practitioners. However, the intricate multi-head attention mechanism of ViT presents significant challenges to interpretability, as the underlying prediction process remains opaque. A critical limitation arises from an observation commonly noted in transformer architectures: "Not all attention heads are equally meaningful." Overlooking the relative importance of specific heads highlights the limitations of existing interpretability methods. To address these challenges, we introduce Gradient-Driven Multi-Head Attention Rollout (GMAR), a novel method that quantifies the importance of each attention head using gradient-based scores. These scores are normalized to derive a weighted aggregate attention score, effectively capturing the relative contributions of individual heads. GMAR clarifies the role of each head in the prediction process, enabling more precise interpretability at the head level. Experimental results demonstrate that GMAR consistently outperforms traditional attention rollout techniques. This work provides a practical contribution to transformer-based architectures, establishing a robust framework for enhancing the interpretability of Vision Transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |

It has been mainstream that the teacher directly transfers knowledge to the student with its original distribution, which can possibly lead to incorrect predictions. In this article, we propose a logit-based distillation via swapped logit processing, namely Swapped Logit Distillation (SLD). SLD is proposed under two assumptions: (1) the wrong prediction occurs when the prediction label confidence is not the maximum; (2) the "natural" limit of probability remains uncertain as the best value addition to the target cannot be determined. To address these issues, we propose a swapped logit processing scheme. Through this approach, we find that the swap method can be effectively extended to teacher and student outputs, transforming into two teachers. We further introduce loss scheduling to boost the performance of two teachers' alignment. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that SLD consistently performs best among previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Multimedia Systems 2025</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we analyze why attention-based methods tend to rely on spurious correlations in their predictions. Furthermore, we revisit max-pooling-based approaches and examine the reasons behind the underperformance of existing methods. We argue that well-trained max-pooling-based MIL models can make predictions based on causal factors and avoid relying on spurious correlations. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective max-pooling-based MIL method (FocusMIL) that outperforms existing mainstream attention-based methods on two datasets. In this position paper, we advocate renewed attention to max-pooling-based methods to achieve more robust and interpretable predictions.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome these challenges, a dual-branch residual network that integrates spatial and spectral features via parallel branches is proposed in this letter. Additionally, more robust refined prototypes are obtained through a regulation term. Furthermore, a kernel probability matching strategy aligns source and target domain features, alleviating domain shift.

| **[Towards Practical Second-Order Optimizers in Deep Learning: Insights from Fisher Information Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20096v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>First-order optimization methods remain the standard for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by preconditioning the stochastic gradient with a diagonal matrix. Despite the widespread adoption of first-order methods, second-order optimization algorithms often exhibit superior convergence compared to methods like Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited by a significantly higher per-iteration computational cost compared to first-order methods. In this thesis, we present AdaFisher, a novel adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix to adaptively precondition gradients. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between the improved convergence and generalization of second-order methods and the computational efficiency needed for training DNNs. Despite the traditionally slower speed of second-order optimizers, AdaFisher is effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling, exhibiting remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in both accuracy and convergence speed.

Specifically, while human perception can easily identify abnormal appearances or compositions in images, classification models overlook any alterations in the arrangement of object parts as long as they are present in any order, even if unnatural. Hence, this work exposes the vulnerability of having semantic and syntactic discrepancy in images (SSDI) in the form of corruptions that remove or shuffle image patches or present images in the form of puzzles. To address this vulnerability, we propose the concept of "image grammar", comprising "image semantics" and "image syntax". Image semantics pertains to the interpretation of parts or patches within an image, whereas image syntax refers to the arrangement of these parts to form a coherent object. We present a semi-supervised two-stage method for learning the image grammar of visual elements and environments solely from natural images. While the first stage learns the semantic meaning of individual object parts, the second stage learns how their relative arrangement constitutes an entire object. The efficacy of the proposed approach is then demonstrated by achieving SSDI detection rates ranging from 70% to 90% on corruptions generated from CelebA and SUN-RGBD datasets.

While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Edge-Based Learning for Improved Classification Under Adversarial Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20077v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial noise introduces small perturbations in images, misleading deep learning models into misclassification and significantly impacting recognition accuracy. In this study, we analyzed the effects of Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial noise on image classification and investigated whether training on specific image features can improve robustness. We hypothesize that while adversarial noise perturbs various regions of an image, edges may remain relatively stable and provide essential structural information for classification. To test this, we conducted a series of experiments using brain tumor and COVID datasets. Initially, we trained the models on clean images and then introduced subtle adversarial perturbations, which caused deep learning models to significantly misclassify the images. Retraining on a combination of clean and noisy images led to improved performance. To evaluate the robustness of the edge features, we extracted edges from the original/clean images and trained the models exclusively on edge-based representations. When noise was introduced to the images, the edge-based models demonstrated greater resilience to adversarial attacks compared to those trained on the original or clean images. These results suggest that while adversarial noise is able to exploit complex non-edge regions significantly more than edges, the improvement in the accuracy after retraining is marginally more in the original data as compared to the edges. Thus, leveraging edge-based learning can improve the resilience of deep learning models against adversarial perturbations.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a challenging task that has received significant attention in recent years. Specifically, OOD detection refers to the detection of instances that do not belong to the training distribution, while still having good performance on the in-distribution task (e.g., classification or object detection). Recent work has focused on generating synthetic outliers and using them to train an outlier detector, generally achieving improved OOD detection than traditional OOD methods. In this regard, outliers can be generated either in feature or pixel space. Feature space driven methods have shown strong performance on both the classification and object detection tasks, at the expense that the visualization of training outliers remains unknown, making further analysis on OOD failure modes challenging. On the other hand, pixel space outlier generation techniques enabled by diffusion models have been used for image classification using, providing improved OOD detection performance and outlier visualization, although their adaption to the object detection task is as yet unexplored. We therefore introduce Dream-Box, a method that provides a link to object-wise outlier generation in the pixel space for OOD detection. Specifically, we use diffusion models to generate object-wise outliers that are used to train an object detector for an in-distribution task and OOD detection. Our method achieves comparable performance to previous traditional methods while being the first technique to provide concrete visualization of generated OOD objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, LatinX in AI CVPR 2025 Workshop</p></details> | None |

In order to deploy these models in extremely resource-constrained edge devices, it is crucial to reduce their peak memory, which is the maximum memory consumed during the execution of a model. A naive approach to reducing peak memory is aggressive down-sampling of feature maps via pooling with large stride, which often results in unacceptable degradation in network performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose residual encoded distillation (ReDistill) for peak memory reduction in a teacher-student framework, in which a student network with less memory is derived from the teacher network using aggressive pooling. We apply our distillation method to multiple problems in computer vision, including image classification and diffusion-based image generation. For image classification, our method yields 4x-5x theoretical peak memory reduction with less degradation in accuracy for most CNN-based architectures. For diffusion-based image generation, our proposed distillation method yields a denoising network with 4x lower theoretical peak memory while maintaining decent diversity and fidelity for image generation. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to other feature-based and response-based distillation methods when applied to the same student network.

This shortcoming is highlighted in areas where data annotation becomes a time-consuming and error-prone task. In this regard, SSL tackles this challenge by capitalizing on scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data; however, SoTA methods typically depend on pre-trained features and large validation sets to learn effective representations for classification tasks. In addition, the reduced set of labeled data is often randomly sampled, neglecting the selection of more informative samples. Here, we present active-DeepFA, a method that effectively combines CL, teacher-student-based meta-pseudo-labeling and AL to train non-pretrained CNN architectures for image classification in scenarios of scarcity of labeled and abundance of unlabeled data. It integrates DeepFA into a co-training setup that implements two cooperative networks to mitigate confirmation bias from pseudo-labels. The method starts with a reduced set of labeled samples by warming up the networks with supervised CL. Afterward and at regular epoch intervals, label propagation is performed on the 2D projections of the networks' deep features. Next, the most reliable pseudo-labels are exchanged between networks in a cross-training fashion, while the most meaningful samples are annotated and added into the labeled set. The networks independently minimize an objective loss function comprising supervised contrastive, supervised and semi-supervised loss components, enhancing the representations towards image classification. Our approach is evaluated on three challenging biological image datasets using only 5% of labeled samples, improving baselines and outperforming six other SoTA methods. In addition, it reduces annotation effort by achieving comparable results to those of its counterparts with only 3% of labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society (JBCS) [https://journals-sol.sbc.org.br]</p></details> | None |
| **[Examining the Impact of Optical Aberrations to Image Classification and Object Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18510v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be successful in various computer vision applications such that models even infer in safety-critical situations. Therefore, vision models have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as noise or blur. While seminal benchmarks exist to evaluate model robustness to diverse corruptions, blur is often approximated in an overly simplistic way to model defocus, while ignoring the different blur kernel shapes that result from optical systems. To study model robustness against realistic optical blur effects, this paper proposes two datasets of blur corruptions, which we denote OpticsBench and LensCorruptions. OpticsBench examines primary aberrations such as coma, defocus, and astigmatism, i.e. aberrations that can be represented by varying a single parameter of Zernike polynomials. To go beyond the principled but synthetic setting of primary aberrations, LensCorruptions samples linear combinations in the vector space spanned by Zernike polynomials, corresponding to 100 real lenses. Evaluations for image classification and object detection on ImageNet and MSCOCO show that for a variety of different pre-trained models, the performance on OpticsBench and LensCorruptions varies significantly, indicating the need to consider realistic image corruptions to evaluate a model's robustness against blur.</p></details> | v1.0 | None |
| **[Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD: Robust and Efficient Data-Parallel Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18454v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and continue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven development of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD (PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023), designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose DMS-Net, a dual-modal multi-scale Siamese network for binocular fundus image classification. Our framework leverages weight-shared Siamese ResNet-152 backbones to extract deep semantic features from paired fundus images. To tackle challenges such as lesion boundary ambiguity and scattered pathological distributions, we introduce a Multi-Scale Context-Aware Module (MSCAM) that integrates adaptive pooling and attention mechanisms for multi-resolution feature aggregation. Additionally, a Dual-Modal Feature Fusion (DMFF) module enhances cross-modal interaction through spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention, effectively combining global context and local edge features. Evaluated on the ODIR-5K dataset, DMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with 80.5% accuracy, 86.1% recall, and 83.8% Cohen's kappa, demonstrating superior capability in detecting symmetric pathologies and advancing clinical decision-making for ocular diseases.</p></details> |  | None |

However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> | None |

One of the main obstacles to the interpretation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which mixes visual information across the whole image in a complex way. In this paper, we propose Hindered Transformer (HiT), a novel interpretable by design architecture inspired by visual transformers. Our proposed architecture rethinks the design of transformers to better disentangle patch influences at the classification stage. Ultimately, HiT can be interpreted as a linear combination of patch-level information. We show that the advantages of our approach in terms of explicability come with a reasonable trade-off in performance, making it an attractive alternative for applications where interpretability is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 official version.

| **[Enhanced Sample Selection with Confidence Tracking: Identifying Correctly Labeled yet Hard-to-Learn Samples in Noisy Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17474v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes. Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing methods for learning with noisy labels.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover, represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture [12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races, sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales, and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following: (a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into G-equivariant networks</p></details> |  | None |

| **[A Diff-Attention Aware State Space Fusion Model for Remote Sensing Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16665v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images describe the same land surface, so these images not only have their own advantages, but also have a lot of similar information. In order to separate these similar information and their respective advantages, reduce the feature redundancy in the fusion stage. This paper introduces a diff-attention aware state space fusion model (DAS2F-Model) for multimodal remote sensing image classification. Based on the selective state space model, a cross-modal diff-attention module (CMDA-Module) is designed to extract and separate the common features and their respective dominant features of MS and PAN images. Among this, space preserving visual mamba (SPVM) retains image spatial features and captures local features by optimizing visual mamba's input reasonably. Considering that features in the fusion stage will have large semantic differences after feature separation and simple fusion operations struggle to effectively integrate these significantly different features, an attention-aware linear fusion module (AALF-Module) is proposed. It performs pixel-wise linear fusion by calculating influence coefficients. This mechanism can fuse features with large semantic differences while keeping the feature size unchanged. Empirical evaluations indicate that the presented method achieves better results than alternative approaches.

This differential equation is controlled by two quantities, a contraction factor that brings together trajectories corresponding to slightly different datasets, and a perturbation factor that accounts for them training on different datasets. We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram matrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap after training in terms of the alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''. Empirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this analysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, at any point during training, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the training process is benign, i.e., it does not lead to significant deterioration of the generalization gap (which is zero at initialization). The alignment between the effective Gram matrix and the residual is different for different datasets and architectures.

This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models often lack interpretability and suffer from inefficiencies due to dense embedding representations. We propose SparseJEPA, an extension that integrates sparse representation learning into the JEPA framework to enhance the quality of learned representations. SparseJEPA employs a penalty method that encourages latent space variables to be shared among data features with strong semantic relationships, while maintaining predictive performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SparseJEPA by training on the CIFAR-100 dataset and pre-training a lightweight Vision Transformer. The improved embeddings are utilized in linear-probe transfer learning for both image classification and low-level tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility across different transfer tasks. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof that demonstrates that the grouping mechanism enhances representation quality. This was done by displaying that grouping reduces Multiinformation among latent-variables, including proofing the Data Processing Inequality for Multiinformation. Our results indicate that incorporating sparsity not only refines the latent space but also facilitates the learning of more meaningful and interpretable representations. In further work, hope to further extend this method by finding new ways to leverage the grouping mechanism through object-centric representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Through extensive experimentation, we compare the performance of traditional CNN-based, ResNet-based, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in terms of accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 has excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 has proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite EO tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient RS-IC in satellite operations, achieving 98.76 % of accuracy, precision, and recall. Precisely, EfficientViT-M2 delivers the highest performance across all metrics, excels in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrates greater robustness (overall robustness score of 0.79). Consequently, EfficientViT-M2 consumes 63.93 % less power than MobileViTV2 (79.23 W) and 73.26 % less power than SwinTransformer (108.90 W).

Recently, the Mamba architecture based on selective state-space models (S6) has demonstrated great advantages in long sequence modeling. However, the unique properties of hyperspectral data, such as high dimensionality and feature inlining, pose challenges to the application of Mamba to HSI classification. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose an full-field interaction multi-groups Mamba framework (HS-Mamba), which adopts a strategy different from pixel-patch based or whole-image based, but combines the advantages of both. The patches cut from the whole image are sent to multi-groups Mamba, combined with positional information to perceive local inline features in the spatial and spectral domains, and the whole image is sent to a lightweight attention module to enhance the global feature representation ability. Specifically, HS-Mamba consists of a dual-channel spatial-spectral encoder (DCSS-encoder) module and a lightweight global inline attention (LGI-Att) branch. The DCSS-encoder module uses multiple groups of Mamba to decouple and model the local features of dual-channel sequences with non-overlapping patches. The LGI-Att branch uses a lightweight compressed and extended attention module to perceive the global features of the spatial and spectral domains of the unsegmented whole image. By fusing local and global features, high-precision classification of hyperspectral images is achieved. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HS-Mamba, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark HSI datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ClusterViG: Efficient Globally Aware Vision GNNs via Image Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10640v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | IEEE MCNA 2025 | None |

To more efficiently adapt to ground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes KANet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of 3D KAN Conv and an adaptive grid update mechanism. By introducing learnable univariate B-spline functions on network edges, specifically by flattening three-dimensional neighborhoods into vectors and applying B-spline-parameterized nonlinear activation functions to replace the fixed linear weights of traditional 3D convolutional kernels, we precisely capture complex spectral-spatial nonlinear relationships in hyperspectral data. Simultaneously, through a dynamic grid adjustment mechanism, we adaptively update the grid point positions of B-splines based on the statistical characteristics of input data, optimizing the resolution of spline functions to match the non-uniform distribution of spectral features, significantly improving the model's accuracy in high-dimensional data modeling and parameter efficiency, effectively alleviating the curse of dimensionality. This characteristic demonstrates superior neural scaling laws compared to traditional convolutional neural networks and reduces overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. KANet enhances model representation capability through a 3D dynamic expert convolution system without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

The investigated approaches include the Sobol global sensitivity analysis, the local sensitivity method for input pixel perturbations and the activation maximization technique. As examples, in this study we consider a small feedforward neural network for analyzing an open tabular dataset of clinical diabetes data, as well as two classical convolutional architectures, VGG-16 and ResNet-18, which are widely used in image processing and classification. Utilization of the global sensitivity analysis allows us to identify the leading input parameters of the chosen tiny neural network and reduce their number without significant loss of the accuracy. As far as global sensitivity analysis is not applicable to larger models we try the local sensitivity analysis and activation maximization method in application to the convolutional neural networks. These methods show interesting patterns for the convolutional models solving the image classification problem. All in all, we compare the results of the activation maximization method with popular Grad-CAM technique in the context of ultrasound data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 16 figures, 32 references</p></details> | None |

While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables.

However, state-of-the-art methods often rely on fine-tuning techniques like prompt learning and adapter-based tuning to optimize CLIP's performance. The necessity for fine-tuning significantly limits CLIP's adaptability to novel datasets and domains. This requirement mandates substantial time and computational resources for each new dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce simple yet effective training-free approaches, Single-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (SLAC) and Two-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (TLAC), that leverages powerful Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini, for image classification. The proposed methods leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LMMs, allowing for seamless adaptation to diverse datasets and domains without the need for additional training. Our approaches involve prompting the LMM to identify objects within an image. Subsequently, the CLIP text encoder determines the image class by identifying the dataset class with the highest semantic similarity to the LLM predicted object. Our models achieved superior accuracy on 9 of 11 base-to-novel datasets, including ImageNet, SUN397, and Caltech101, while maintaining a strictly training-free paradigm. Our TLAC model achieved an overall accuracy of 83.44%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art few-shot methods by a margin of 6.75%.

However, ViTs face challenges such as high computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention and the requirement of a large amount of training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Efficient Convolutional Vision Transformer (ECViT), a hybrid architecture that effectively combines the strengths of CNNs and Transformers. ECViT introduces inductive biases such as locality and translation invariance, inherent to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the Transformer framework by extracting patches from low-level features and enhancing the encoder with convolutional operations. Additionally, it incorporates local-attention and a pyramid structure to enable efficient multi-scale feature extraction and representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ECViT achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art models on various image classification tasks while maintaining low computational and storage requirements. ECViT offers an ideal solution for applications that prioritize high efficiency without compromising performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14815v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures | None |

Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training method for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has inspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such alternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a biologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses throughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers, thereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study presents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its effectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks. Our experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve high accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and convergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron count, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations formed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature extraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that EDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks and will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks.

However, their efficient implementation strategy has not been comprehensively studied, hence limiting SNN deployments for edge AI systems. Toward this, we propose a design methodology to enable efficient SNN processing on commodity neuromorphic processors. To do this, we first study the key characteristics of targeted neuromorphic hardware (e.g., memory and compute budgets), and leverage this information to perform compatibility analysis for network selection. Afterward, we employ a mapping strategy for efficient SNN implementation on the targeted processor. Furthermore, we incorporate an efficient on-chip learning mechanism to update the systems' knowledge for adapting to new input classes and dynamic environments. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology leads the system to achieve low latency of inference (i.e., less than 50ms for image classification, less than 200ms for real-time object detection in video streaming, and less than 1ms in keyword recognition) and low latency of on-chip learning (i.e., less than 2ms for keyword recognition), while incurring less than 250mW of processing power and less than 15mJ of energy consumption across the respective different applications and scenarios.

Alternatively, ensemble learning also improves performance, although training, storing, and deploying multiple models becomes impractical as the number of models grows. Even distilling an ensemble to a single student model or weight averaging methods first requires training of multiple teacher models and does not fully leverage the inherent stochasticity for generating and distilling diversity in DL models. These constraints are particularly prohibitive in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications such as wearable devices. This paper proposes to train only one model and generate multiple diverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. However, generating these representations stochastically leads to noisy representations that are misaligned with the learned task. To overcome this problem, a novel stochastic self-distillation (SSD) training strategy is introduced for filtering and weighting teacher representation to distill from task-relevant representations only, using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD). The student representation at each distillation step is used as authority to guide the distillation process. Experimental results on real-world affective computing, wearable/biosignal datasets from the UCR Archive, the HAR dataset, and image classification datasets show that the proposed SSD method can outperform state-of-the-art methods without increasing the model size at both training and testing time, and incurs negligible computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art ensemble learning and weight averaging methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Using two lightweight modules integrated into architectures such as CNNs and Transformers,we estimate these components and demonstrate their interpretive power through visualizations on ResNet and prototype network applied to image classification and few-shot learning tasks. Our approach is distinguished by three key features: 1. Rooted in mutual information theory, it delivers a thorough and theoretically grounded interpretation, surpassing the scope of existing interpretability methods. 2. Unlike conventional methods that focus on explaining decisions, our approach centers on interpreting representations. 3. It seamlessly integrates into pre-existing network architectures, requiring only fine-tuning of the inserted modules.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they can also provide significant utility for downstream 3D tasks that can leverage the cross-modal information (e.g., from paired image data). In our work, we further explore the utility of VFMs for adapting from a labeled source to unlabeled target data for the task of LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation. Our method consumes paired 2D-3D (image and point cloud) data and relies on the robust (cross-domain) features from a VFM to train a 3D backbone on a mix of labeled source and unlabeled target data. At the heart of our method lies a fusion network that is guided by both the image and point cloud streams, with their relative contributions adjusted based on the target domain.

However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high computational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small and representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support set samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary information loss. These methods may also be less effective for image classification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations, we propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We introduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor for identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies. By leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of selected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve into a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image classification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\%. Notably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong performance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework for resource-constrained real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

| **[A Retention-Centric Framework for Continual Learning with Guaranteed Model Developmental Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03955v4)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, learning-enabled systems often undergo iterative model development to address challenging or emerging tasks, which involve collecting new data, training a new model and validating the model. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose good capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. While existing continual learning aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance, it often falls short in cost-sensitive applications, where failing to preserve essential established capabilities introduces unforeseen costs and risks and substantial expenses for re-improving these capabilities. To address this issue, we impose a requirement on learning systems to ensure that a new model strictly retains important capabilities of the old model while improving target-task performance, which we term model developmental safety. To ensure model developmental safety, we propose a retention-centric framework with data-dependent constraints, and study how to continually develop a pretrained CLIP model for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees and use its insights to finetune the CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Experiments on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets validate the efficacy of our method.</p></details> | 44 pages, 7 figures | None |

As AI systems advance and find application in safety-critical domains, effectively handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial to building open-world learning systems. In this work, we introduce ALOE, a novel active learning algorithm for open-world environments designed to enhance model adaptation by incorporating new OOD classes via a two-stage approach. First, diversity sampling selects a representative set of examples, followed by energy-based OOD detection to prioritize likely unknown classes for annotation. This strategy accelerates class discovery and learning, even under constrained annotation budgets. Evaluations on three long-tailed image classification benchmarks demonstrate that ALOE outperforms traditional active learning baselines, effectively expanding known categories while balancing annotation cost. Our findings reveal a crucial tradeoff between enhancing known-class performance and discovering new classes, setting the stage for future advancements in open-world machine learning.</p></details> |  | None |

This concept has emerged as a promising direction for establishing general-purpose machine-learning models in recent preliminary works, e.g., for visual representation learning. In this paper, we present CheXWorld, the first effort towards a self-supervised world model for radiographic images. Specifically, our work develops a unified framework that simultaneously models three aspects of medical knowledge essential for qualified radiologists, including 1) local anatomical structures describing the fine-grained characteristics of local tissues (e.g., architectures, shapes, and textures); 2) global anatomical layouts describing the global organization of the human body (e.g., layouts of organs and skeletons); and 3) domain variations that encourage CheXWorld to model the transitions across different appearance domains of radiographs (e.g., varying clarity, contrast, and exposure caused by collecting radiographs from different hospitals, devices, or patients). Empirically, we design tailored qualitative and quantitative analyses, revealing that CheXWorld successfully captures these three dimensions of medical knowledge. Furthermore, transfer learning experiments across eight medical image classification and segmentation benchmarks showcase that CheXWorld significantly outperforms existing SSL methods and large-scale medical foundation models.

Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets.

We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Perso...</summary><p>Personal adaptation and expansion of doctoral thesis (originally submitted in Oct 2024, revisioned in Jan 2025)</p></details> | None |

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, MultiShield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. MultiShield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that MultiShield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at Pattern Recognition Letters journal Keywords: adversarial examples, rejection defense, multimodal-informed systems, machine learning security</p></details> | None |

By increasing the fraction of neurons activated during classification, these attacks reduce sparsity in network activation patterns, worsening the performance of hardware accelerators. In this work, we present a novel training-time attack, named sponge poisoning, which aims to worsen energy consumption and prediction latency of neural networks on any test input without affecting classification accuracy. To stage this attack, we assume that the attacker can control only a few model updates during training -- a likely scenario, e.g., when model training is outsourced to an untrusted third party or distributed via federated learning. Our extensive experiments on image classification tasks show that sponge poisoning is effective, and that fine-tuning poisoned models to repair them poses prohibitive costs for most users, highlighting that tackling sponge poisoning remains an open issue.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at Information Sciences journal; 20 pages Keywords: energy-latency attacks, sponge attack, machine learning security, adversarial machine learning</p></details> | None |

However, these methods rely heavily on data augmentation during representation learning, which can lead to suboptimal results if not implemented carefully. A common augmentation technique in contrastive learning is random cropping followed by resizing. This can degrade the quality of representation learning when the two random crops contain distinct semantic content. To tackle this issue, we introduce LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations), a framework that employs a novel instance discrimination approach and an adapted loss function. This method prevents the loss of important semantic features caused by mapping different object parts during representation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that LeOCLR consistently improves representation learning across various datasets, outperforming baseline models. For instance, LeOCLR surpasses MoCo-v2 by 5.1% on ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and outperforms several other methods on transfer learning and object detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables - accepted at TMLR 10/2024; V4 corrected some typos in the references</p></details> | None |

We model gradient updates as a probabilistic model and utilize stochastic variational inference (SVI) to derive an efficient and effective update rule. Further, we show how our VSGD method relates to other adaptive gradient-based optimizers like Adam. Lastly, we carry out experiments on two image classification datasets and four deep neural network architectures, where we show that VSGD outperforms Adam and SGD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Hierarchical Bidirectional Consistency Learning for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13608v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) aims to categorize closely related subclasses, a task complicated by minimal inter-class differences and significant intra-class variance. Existing methods often rely on additional annotations for image classification, overlooking the valuable information embedded in Tree Hierarchies that depict hierarchical label relationships. To leverage this knowledge to improve classification accuracy and consistency, we propose a novel Cross-Hierarchical Bidirectional Consistency Learning (CHBC) framework. The CHBC framework extracts discriminative features across various hierarchies using a specially designed module to decompose and enhance attention masks and features. We employ bidirectional consistency loss to regulate the classification outcomes across different hierarchies, ensuring label prediction consistency and reducing misclassification. Experiments on three widely used FGVC datasets validate the effectiveness of the CHBC framework. Ablation studies further investigate the application strategies of feature enhancement and consistency constraints, underscoring the significant contributions of the proposed modules.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional attention mechanisms, despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features, adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%) models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bayesian continual learning and forgetting in neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13569v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological synapses effortlessly balance memory retention and flexibility, yet artificial neural networks still struggle with the extremes of catastrophic forgetting and catastrophic remembering. Here, we introduce Metaplasticity from Synaptic Uncertainty (MESU), a Bayesian framework that updates network parameters according their uncertainty. This approach allows a principled combination of learning and forgetting that ensures that critical knowledge is preserved while unused or outdated information is gradually released. Unlike standard Bayesian approaches -- which risk becoming overly constrained, and popular continual-learning methods that rely on explicit task boundaries, MESU seamlessly adapts to streaming data. It further provides reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates, allowing out-of-distribution detection, the only computational cost being to sample the weights multiple times to provide proper output statistics. Experiments on image-classification benchmarks demonstrate that MESU mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while maintaining plasticity for new tasks. When training 200 sequential permuted MNIST tasks, MESU outperforms established continual learning techniques in terms of accuracy, capability to learn additional tasks, and out-of-distribution data detection. Additionally, due to its non-reliance on task boundaries, MESU outperforms conventional learning techniques on the incremental training of CIFAR-100 tasks consistently in a wide range of scenarios. Our results unify ideas from metaplasticity, Bayesian inference, and Hessian-based regularization, offering a biologically-inspired pathway to robust, perpetual learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, we tackle the instability issue arising in their first layer, which tends to learn parameters that closely resemble oriented band-pass filters when trained on datasets like ImageNet. Subsampled convolutions with such Gabor-like filters are prone to aliasing, causing sensitivity to small input shifts. In this context, we establish conditions under which the max pooling operator approximates a complex modulus, which is nearly shift invariant. We then derive a measure of shift invariance for subsampled convolutions followed by max pooling. In particular, we highlight the crucial role played by the filter's frequency and orientation in achieving stability. We experimentally validate our theory by considering a deterministic feature extractor based on the dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform, a particular case of discrete Gabor-like decomposition.</p></details> |  | None |

This vulnerability pose significant risks in high-stakes applications such as autonomous vehicles, security surveillance, and safety-critical inspection systems. While the existing literature extensively covers adversarial attacks in image classification, comprehensive analyses of such attacks on object detection systems remain limited. This paper presents a novel taxonomic framework for categorizing adversarial attacks specific to object detection architectures, synthesizes existing robustness metrics, and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art attack methodologies on popular object detection models, including both traditional detectors and modern detectors with vision-language pretraining. Through rigorous analysis of open-source attack implementations and their effectiveness across diverse detection architectures, we derive key insights into attack characteristics. Furthermore, we delineate critical research gaps and emerging challenges to guide future investigations in securing object detection systems against adversarial threats. Our findings establish a foundation for developing more robust detection models while highlighting the urgent need for standardized evaluation protocols in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> | None |
| **[Impact of Data Duplication on Deep Neural Network-Based Image Classifiers: Robust vs. Standard Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00638v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy and robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks are significantly influenced by factors such as training data quality, model architecture, the training process, and the deployment environment. In recent years, duplicated data in training sets, especially in language models, has attracted considerable attention. It has been shown that deduplication enhances both training performance and model accuracy in language models. While the importance of data quality in training image classifier Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is widely recognized, the impact of duplicated images in the training set on model generalization and performance has received little attention. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a comprehensive study on the effect of duplicates in image classification. Our analysis indicates that the presence of duplicated images in the training set not only negatively affects the efficiency of model training but also may result in lower accuracy of the image classifier. This negative impact of duplication on accuracy is particularly evident when duplicated data is non-uniform across classes or when duplication, whether uniform or non-uniform, occurs in the training set of an adversarially trained model. Even when duplicated samples are selected in a uniform way, increasing the amount of duplication does not lead to a significant improvement in accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing transformer models excel in capturing long-range dependencies but often suffer from information redundancy and attention inefficiencies, limiting their ability to model fine-grained relationships crucial for HSI classification. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes MemFormer, a lightweight and memory-enhanced transformer. MemFormer introduces a memory-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism that iteratively refines a dynamic memory module, enhancing feature extraction while reducing redundancy across layers. Additionally, a dynamic memory enrichment strategy progressively captures complex spatial and spectral dependencies, leading to more expressive feature representations. To further improve structural consistency, we incorporate a spatial-spectral positional encoding (SSPE) tailored for HSI data, ensuring continuity without the computational burden of convolution-based approaches. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MemFormer achieves superior classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Expert Kernel Generation Network Driven by Contextual Mapping for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13045v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more efficiently adapt to ground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes EKGNet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of a context-aware mapping network and a dynamic kernel generation module. The context-aware mapping module translates global contextual information of hyperspectral inputs into instructions for combining base convolutional kernels, while the dynamic kernels are composed of K groups of base convolutions, analogous to K different types of experts specializing in fundamental patterns across various dimensions. The mapping module and dynamic kernel generation mechanism form a tightly coupled system - the former generates meaningful combination weights based on inputs, while the latter constructs an adaptive expert convolution system using these weights. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus more flexibly on key spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on the fixed receptive field of a single static convolutional kernel. EKGNet enhances model representation capability through a 3D dynamic expert convolution system without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.23472</p></details> | None |

However, due to less capable ML models that can be embedded in resource-limited devices, use cases are limited to simple inference tasks such as visual keyword spotting, gesture recognition, and predictive analytics. In this context, the Hierarchical Inference (HI) system has emerged as a promising solution that augments the capabilities of the local ML by offloading selected samples to an edge server or cloud for remote ML inference. Existing works demonstrate through simulation that HI improves accuracy. However, they do not account for the latency and energy consumption on the device, nor do they consider three key heterogeneous dimensions that characterize ML systems: hardware, network connectivity, and models. In contrast, this paper systematically compares the performance of HI with on-device inference based on measurements of accuracy, latency, and energy for running embedded ML models on five devices with different capabilities and three image classification datasets. For a given accuracy requirement, the HI systems we designed achieved up to 73% lower latency and up to 77% lower device energy consumption than an on-device inference system. The key to building an efficient HI system is the availability of small-size, reasonably accurate on-device models whose outputs can be effectively differentiated for samples that require remote inference. Despite the performance gains, HI requires on-device inference for all samples, which adds a fixed overhead to its latency and energy consumption. Therefore, we design a hybrid system, Early Exit with HI (EE-HI), and demonstrate that compared to HI, EE-HI reduces the latency by up to 59.7% and lowers the device's energy consumption by up to 60.4%.</p></details> |  | None |

Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning (HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack (FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.</p></details> |  | None |

It is commonly framed as multiple single-level tasks, but each level may rely on different visual cues: Distinguishing 'Bird' from 'Plant' relies on global features like feathers or leaves, while separating 'Anna's hummingbird' from 'Green hermit' requires local details such as head coloration. Prior methods improve accuracy using external semantic supervision, but such statistical learning criteria fail to ensure consistent visual grounding at test time, resulting in incorrect hierarchical classification. We propose, for the first time, to enforce internal visual consistency by aligning fine-to-coarse predictions through intra-image segmentation. Our method outperforms zero-shot CLIP and state-of-the-art baselines on hierarchical classification benchmarks, achieving both higher accuracy and more consistent predictions. It also improves internal image segmentation without requiring pixel-level annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

The addition of calculated small distortion to images, for instance, can deceive a well-trained image classification network. In this work, we propose a novel attack technique called Sparse Adversarial and Interpretable Attack Framework (SAIF). Specifically, we design imperceptible attacks that contain low-magnitude perturbations at a small number of pixels and leverage these sparse attacks to reveal the vulnerability of classifiers. We use the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm to simultaneously optimize the attack perturbations for bounded magnitude and sparsity with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence. Empirical results show that SAIF computes highly imperceptible and interpretable adversarial examples, and outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attack methods on the ImageNet dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces the FLIP dataset, a benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities based on human verification tasks on the Idena blockchain. FLIP challenges present users with two orderings of 4 images, requiring them to identify the logically coherent one. By emphasizing sequential reasoning, visual storytelling, and common sense, FLIP provides a unique testbed for multimodal AI systems. Our experiments evaluate state-of-the-art models, leveraging both vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). Results reveal that even the best open-sourced and closed-sourced models achieve maximum accuracies of 75.5% and 77.9%, respectively, in zero-shot settings, compared to human performance of 95.3%. Captioning models aid reasoning models by providing text descriptions of images, yielding better results than when using the raw images directly, 69.6% vs. 75.2% for Gemini 1.5 Pro. Combining the predictions from 15 models in an ensemble increases the accuracy to 85.2%.

Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained visual-language models, such as CLIP. However, due to the modality gap, which is the inconsistent distribution of image and text features in the joint embedding space, directly using these features as class prototypes often leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Mapping (CMM) method. This method globally aligns image features with the text feature space through linear transformation and optimizes their local spatial relationships using triplet loss, thereby significantly enhancing cross-modal consistency. Experimental results show that compared to other methods, CMM simplifies the training process and demonstrates higher efficiency. Furthermore, CMM improves the average Top-1 accuracy by 1.06% on 11 benchmark datasets compared to methods that partially fine-tune the backbone, and it performs excellently on 4 distribution shift datasets. Notably, CMM effectively mitigates the modality gap in pre-trained models, enabling text features to serve as effective class prototypes for image features, thus providing an efficient and highly generalizable solution for few-shot learning.</p></details> |  | None |

It is commonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each WSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are considered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large number of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when utilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders most existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical practice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification (WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number of bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the absence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image classification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images unsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a concise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem through two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two heterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance classification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish cross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between the two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and instance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when limited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful resolution.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[reBEN: Refined BigEarthNet Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03653v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents refined BigEarthNet (reBEN) that is a large-scale, multi-modal remote sensing dataset constructed to support deep learning (DL) studies for remote sensing image analysis. The reBEN dataset consists of 549,488 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct reBEN, we initially consider the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 tiles used to construct the BigEarthNet dataset and then divide them into patches of size 1200 m x 1200 m. We apply atmospheric correction to the Sentinel-2 patches using the latest version of the sen2cor tool, resulting in higher-quality patches compared to those present in BigEarthNet. Each patch is then associated with a pixel-level reference map and scene-level multi-labels. This makes reBEN suitable for pixel- and scene-based learning tasks. The labels are derived from the most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 by utilizing the 19-class nomenclature as in BigEarthNet. The use of the most recent CLC map results in overcoming the label noise present in BigEarthNet. Furthermore, we introduce a new geographical-based split assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the spatial correlation among the train, validation, and test sets with respect to those present in BigEarthNet. This increases the reliability of the evaluation of DL models. To minimize the DL model training time, we introduce software tools that convert the reBEN dataset into a DL-optimized data format. In our experiments, we show the potential of reBEN for multi-modal multi-label image classification problems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models. The pre-trained model weights, associated code, and complete dataset are available at https://bigearth.net.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2025.

| **[Exploring Video-Based Driver Activity Recognition under Noisy Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11966v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an open research topic in the field of deep learning, learning with noisy labels has attracted much attention and grown rapidly over the past ten years. Learning with label noise is crucial for driver distraction behavior recognition, as real-world video data often contains mislabeled samples, impacting model reliability and performance. However, label noise learning is barely explored in the driver activity recognition field. In this paper, we propose the first label noise learning approach for the driver activity recognition task. Based on the cluster assumption, we initially enable the model to learn clustering-friendly low-dimensional representations from given videos and assign the resultant embeddings into clusters. We subsequently perform co-refinement within each cluster to smooth the classifier outputs. Furthermore, we propose a flexible sample selection strategy that combines two selection criteria without relying on any hyperparameters to filter clean samples from the training dataset. We also incorporate a self-adaptive parameter into the sample selection process to enforce balancing across classes. A comprehensive variety of experiments on the public Drive&Act dataset for all granularity levels demonstrates the superior performance of our method in comparison with other label-denoising methods derived from the image classification field.

| **[Masked Autoencoders are Robust Data Augmentors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04846v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are capable of learning powerful representations to tackle complex vision tasks but expose undesirable properties like the over-fitting issue. To this end, regularization techniques like image augmentation are necessary for deep neural networks to generalize well. Nevertheless, most prevalent image augmentation recipes confine themselves to off-the-shelf linear transformations like scale, flip, and colorjitter. Due to their hand-crafted property, these augmentations are insufficient to generate truly hard augmented examples. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective of augmentation to regularize the training process. Inspired by the recent success of applying masked image modeling to self-supervised learning, we adopt the self-supervised masked autoencoder to generate the distorted view of the input images. We show that utilizing such model-based nonlinear transformation as data augmentation can improve high-level recognition tasks. We term the proposed method as \textbf{M}ask-\textbf{R}econstruct \textbf{A}ugmentation (MRA). The extensive experiments on various image classification benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation. Specifically, MRA consistently enhances the performance on supervised, semi-supervised as well as few-shot classification.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Diversity-Driven Learning: Tackling Spurious Correlations and Data Heterogeneity in Federated Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11216v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning models on distributed data while preserving privacy. However, in real-world FL settings, client data is often non-identically distributed and imbalanced, resulting in statistical data heterogeneity which impacts the generalization capabilities of the server's model across clients, slows convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by first proposing a characterization of statistical data heterogeneity by means of 6 metrics of global and client attribute imbalance, class imbalance, and spurious correlations. Next, we create and share 7 computer vision datasets for binary and multiclass image classification tasks in Federated Learning that cover a broad range of statistical data heterogeneity and hence simulate real-world situations. Finally, we propose FedDiverse, a novel client selection algorithm in FL which is designed to manage and leverage data heterogeneity across clients by promoting collaboration between clients with complementary data distributions. Experiments on the seven proposed FL datasets demonstrate FedDiverse's effectiveness in enhancing the performance and robustness of a variety of FL methods while having low communication and computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

The platform uses a Reinforcement Learning agent to add minimum distortion to input images while still causing misclassification by the target model. The agent uses a novel dual-action method to explore the input image at each step to identify sensitive regions for adding distortions while removing noises that have less impact on the target model. This dual action leads to faster and more efficient convergence of the attack. The platform can also be used to measure the robustness of image classification models against specific distortion types. Also, retraining the model with adversarial samples significantly improved robustness when evaluated on benchmark datasets. The proposed platform outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average number of queries required to cause misclassification. This advances trustworthiness with a positive social impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence Proceedings</p></details> | None |
| **[Embedding Radiomics into Vision Transformers for Multimodal Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10916v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical image analysis, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) offering a powerful alternative to convolutional models by modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, ViTs are inherently data-intensive and lack domain-specific inductive biases, limiting their applicability in medical imaging. In contrast, radiomics provides interpretable, handcrafted descriptors of tissue heterogeneity but suffers from limited scalability and integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. In this work, we propose the Radiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features with data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone. Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and patch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in medical image classification. Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into patches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused with linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were normalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable [CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated RE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal OCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. RE-ViT was benchmarked against CNN-based (VGG-16, ResNet) and hybrid (TransMed) models. Results: RE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art results: on BUSI, AUC=0.950+/-0.011; on ChestXray2017, AUC=0.989+/-0.004; on Retinal OCT, AUC=0.986+/-0.001, which outperforms other comparison models. Conclusions: The RE-ViT framework effectively integrates radiomics with ViT architectures, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability across multimodal medical image classification tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures | None |

To better adapt to ground object distributions while expanding receptive fields without introducing excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes WCNet, an improved 3D-DenseNet model integrated with wavelet transforms. We introduce wavelet transforms to effectively extend convolutional receptive fields and guide CNNs to better respond to low frequencies through cascading, termed wavelet convolution. Each convolution focuses on different frequency bands of the input signal with gradually increasing effective ranges. This process enables greater emphasis on low-frequency components while adding only a small number of trainable parameters. This dynamic approach allows the model to flexibly focus on critical spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on fixed receptive fields of single static kernels. The Wavelet Conv module enhances model representation capability by expanding receptive fields through 3D wavelet transforms without increasing network depth or width. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2504.04463</p></details> | None |
| **[Interpretable Failure Detection with Human-Level Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05275v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable failure detection holds paramount importance in safety-critical applications. Yet, neural networks are known to produce overconfident predictions for misclassified samples. As a result, it remains a problematic matter as existing confidence score functions rely on category-level signals, the logits, to detect failures. This research introduces an innovative strategy, leveraging human-level concepts for a dual purpose: to reliably detect when a model fails and to transparently interpret why. By integrating a nuanced array of signals for each category, our method enables a finer-grained assessment of the model's confidence. We present a simple yet highly effective approach based on the ordinal ranking of concept activation to the input image. Without bells and whistles, our method significantly reduce the false positive rate across diverse real-world image classification benchmarks, specifically by 3.7% on ImageNet and 9% on EuroSAT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Computation and Communication Efficient Lightweighting Vertical Federated Learning for Smart Building IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00466v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing number and enhanced capabilities of IoT devices in smart buildings, these devices are evolving beyond basic data collection and control to actively participate in deep learning tasks. Federated Learning (FL), as a decentralized learning paradigm, is well-suited for such scenarios. However, the limited computational and communication resources of IoT devices present significant challenges. While existing research has extensively explored efficiency improvements in Horizontal FL, these techniques cannot be directly applied to Vertical FL due to fundamental differences in data partitioning and model structure. To address this gap, we propose a Lightweight Vertical Federated Learning (LVFL) framework that jointly optimizes computational and communication efficiency. Our approach introduces two distinct lightweighting strategies: one for reducing the complexity of the feature model to improve local computation, and another for compressing feature embeddings to reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we derive a convergence bound for the proposed LVFL algorithm that explicitly incorporates both computation and communication lightweighting ratios. Experimental results on an image classification task demonstrate that LVFL effectively mitigates resource demands while maintaining competitive learning performance.</p></details> |  | None |

High-quality datasets are crucial for their development, and there is growing interest in datasets composed of neural networks themselves to support benchmarking, automated machine learning (AutoML), and model analysis. We introduce LEMUR, an open source dataset of neural network models with well-structured code for diverse architectures across tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, and natural language processing. LEMUR is primarily designed to enable fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for AutoML tasks, providing a rich source of structured model representations and associated performance data. Leveraging Python and PyTorch, LEMUR enables seamless extension to new datasets and models while maintaining consistency. It integrates an Optuna-powered framework for evaluation, hyperparameter optimization, statistical analysis, and graphical insights. LEMUR provides an extension that enables models to run efficiently on edge devices, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. Providing tools for model evaluation, preprocessing, and database management, LEMUR supports researchers and practitioners in developing, testing, and analyzing neural networks. Additionally, it offers an API that delivers comprehensive information about neural network models and their complete performance statistics with a single request, which can be used in experiments with code-generating large language models. The LEMUR will be released as an open source project under the MIT license upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Correlative and Discriminative Label Grouping for Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09990v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling label correlations has always played a pivotal role in multi-label image classification (MLC), attracting significant attention from researchers. However, recent studies have overemphasized co-occurrence relationships among labels, which can lead to overfitting risk on this overemphasis, resulting in suboptimal models. To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing correlative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient method that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them respectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group contains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label relationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or discriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group contains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to multiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign them from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware representation, which is more conducive to classification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and outperforms SOTA methods on multiple pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> | None |
