| **[Rethinking Hebbian Principle: Low-Dimensional Structural Projection for Unsupervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14810v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks, demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe) |
| **[Free-Grained Hierarchical Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14737v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy, but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic, mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These, along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical classification under real-world constraints.</p></details> | 26 pages | None |
| **[FedPPA: Progressive Parameter Alignment for Personalized Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14698v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however, clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment (FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior performance in personalized adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, TrustCom 2025 Conference</p></details> | None |
| **[Analysis of Hyperparameter Optimization Effects on Lightweight Deep Models for Real-Time Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23315v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based networks are increasingly preferred for real-time image classification, especially on resource-constrained devices. This study evaluates the impact of hyperparameter optimization on the accuracy and deployment feasibility of seven modern lightweight architectures: ConvNeXt-T, EfficientNetV2-S, MobileNetV3-L, MobileViT v2 (S/XS), RepVGG-A2, and TinyViT-21M, trained on a class-balanced subset of 90,000 images from ImageNet-1K. Under standardized training settings, this paper investigates the influence of learning rate schedules, augmentation, optimizers, and initialization on model performance. Inference benchmarks are performed using an NVIDIA L40s GPU with batch sizes ranging from 1 to 512, capturing latency and throughput in real-time conditions. This work demonstrates that controlled hyperparameter variation significantly alters convergence dynamics in lightweight CNN and transformer backbones, providing insight into stability regions and deployment feasibility in edge artificial intelligence. Our results reveal that tuning alone leads to a top-1 accuracy improvement of 1.5 to 3.5 percent over baselines, and select models (e.g., RepVGG-A2, MobileNetV3-L) deliver latency under 5 milliseconds and over 9,800 frames per second, making them ideal for edge deployment. This work provides reproducible, subset-based insights into lightweight hyperparameter tuning and its role in balancing speed and accuracy.

| **[Geometric Moment Alignment for Domain Adaptation via Siegel Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14666v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image denoising and image classification benchmarks.

| **[On Large Multimodal Models as Open-World Image Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21851v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional image classification requires a predefined list of semantic categories. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this requirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g., answering the prompt "What is the main object in the image?"). Despite this remarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance are surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a predefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV2025, 23 pages, 13 figures, code is available at https://github.com/altndrr/lmms-owc</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/altndrr/lmms-owc) |
| **[Vision Mamba for Permeability Prediction of Porous Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14516v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically, a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time, a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of ViTs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Falcon: A Remote Sensing Vision-Language Foundation Model (Technical Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11070v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a holistic vision-language foundation model tailored for remote sensing, named Falcon. Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon) |
| **[Impact of Regularization on Calibration and Robustness: from the Representation Space Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03999v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that regularization techniques using soft labels, e.g., label smoothing, Mixup, and CutMix, not only enhance image classification accuracy but also mitigate miscalibration due to overconfident predictions, and improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However, the underlying mechanisms of such improvements remain underexplored. In this paper, we offer a novel explanation from the perspective of the representation space (i.e., the space of the features obtained at the penultimate layer). Based on examination of decision boundaries and structure of features (or representation vectors), our study investigates confidence contours and gradient directions within the representation space. Furthermore, we analyze the adjustments in feature distributions due to regularization in relation to these contours and directions, from which we uncover central mechanisms inducing improved calibration and robustness. Our findings provide new insights into the characteristics of the high-dimensional representation space in relation to training and regularization using soft labels.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However, non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Scale High-Resolution Logarithmic Grapher Module for Efficient Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13740v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN) and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

| **[MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Large Language Model Agents Enable Autonomous Design and Image Analysis of Microwell Microfluidics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13883v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwell microfluidics has been utilized for single-cell analysis to reveal heterogeneity in gene expression, signaling pathways, and phenotypic responses for identifying rare cell types, understanding disease progression, and developing more precise therapeutic strategies. However, designing microwell microfluidics is a considerably complex task, requiring knowledge, experience, and CAD software, as well as manual intervention, which often fails initial designs, demanding multiple costly and time-consuming iterations. In this study, we establish an autonomous large language model (LLM)-driven microwell design framework to generate code-based computer-aided design (CAD) scripts, that enables the rapid and reproducible creation of microwells with diverse geometries and imaging-based analysis. We propose a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-logistic regression framework based on integrating high-level semantic descriptions generated by MLLMs with image embeddings for image classification tasks, aiming to identify microwell occupancy and microwell shape. The fused multimodal representation is input to a logistic regression model, which is both interpretable and computationally efficient. We achieved significant improvements, exceeding 0.92 for occupancy classification and 0.99 for shape classification, across all evaluated MLLMs, compared with 0.50 and 0.55, respectively, when relying solely on direct classification. The MLLM-logistic regression framework is a scalable, efficient solution for high-throughput microwell image analysis. Our study demonstrates an autonomous design microwell platform by translating natural language prompts into optimized device geometries, CAD scripts and image analysis, facilitating the development of next-generation digital discovery by integration of literature mining, autonomous design and experimental data analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Representations through Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05108v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating heterogeneous representations from different architectures has facilitated various vision tasks, e.g., some hybrid networks combine transformers and convolutions. However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

| **[A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation), calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 26 tables, 63 figures, pre-print</p></details> | None |
| **[A Review on Domain Adaption and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12075v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification, where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks: peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image Computing at MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Bayesian Topological Convolutional Neural Nets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11704v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically, it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for more efficient and robust image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

This study benchmarks three foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery: HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%), DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of 93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved 91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Being...</summary><p>Being reviewed for WHISPERS conference ( Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing )</p></details> | None |
| **[Exploring and Leveraging Class Vectors for Classifier Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11268v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and adversarial trigger optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11171v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them. However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture. Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has 14 pages and 7 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Open Vocabulary Multi-Label Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09073v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in open vocabulary computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation. Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient Edge Test-Time Adaptation via Latent Feature Coordinate Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11068v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while $\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore, we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge devices in real-world deployments.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[An Effective Gram Matrix Characterizes Generalization in Deep Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16450v3)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a differential equation that governs the evolution of the generalization gap when a deep network is trained by gradient descent. This differential equation is controlled by two quantities, a contraction factor that brings together trajectories corresponding to slightly different datasets, and a perturbation factor that accounts for them training on different datasets. We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram matrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap in terms of the alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''. Empirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this analysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, during training, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the generalization gap accumulates slowly along the direction of training, charactering a benign training process. We provide novel perspectives for explaining the generalization ability of neural network training with different datasets and architectures through the alignment pattern of the ``residual" and the ``effective Gram matrix".</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FairDD: Fair Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19623v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts has demonstrated its promise for image classification. However, previous research has overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models trained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA), such as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original datasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due to their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair dataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly applied to diverse matching-based DD approaches (DDs), requiring no modifications to their original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in synchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original datasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in vanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows synthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their balanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively regularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while maintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly improves fairness compared to vanilla DDs, with a promising trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs, spanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD approach.

| **[Tversky Neural Networks: Psychologically Plausible Deep Learning with Differentiable Tversky Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11035v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception of similarity. In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity with psychological plausibility based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of their common and distinctive features. This model of similarity has not been used in deep learning before, in part because of the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. In this paper, we develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive basic neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling neural networks, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer. For instance, on the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.8%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both types of projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in modern deep learning, and designing neural networks that are interpretable under an established theory of psychological similarity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box", where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning, not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller, non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly, making classification more challenging. The second method involves the application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms, and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without the need to use background information.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, Master's thesis</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Toward Relative Positional Encoding in Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16745v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that mimic how neurons in the brain communicate through discrete spikes, which have great potential in various tasks due to their energy efficiency and temporal processing capabilities. SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks, and inspired by traditional Transformers, several studies have demonstrated that spiking absolute positional encoding can help capture sequential relationships for input data, enhancing the capabilities of spiking Transformers for tasks such as sequential modeling and image classification. However, how to incorporate relative positional information into SNNs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce several strategies to approximate relative positional encoding in spiking Transformers while preserving the binary nature of spikes. Firstly, we formally prove that encoding relative distances with Gray Code ensures that the binary representations of positional indices maintain a constant Hamming distance whenever their decimal values differ by a power of two, and we propose Gray-PE based on this property. In addition, we propose another RPE method called Log-PE, which combines the logarithmic form of the relative distance matrix directly into the spiking attention map. Furthermore, we extend our RPE methods to a two-dimensional form, making them suitable for processing image patches. We evaluate our RPE methods on various tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification, and the experimental results demonstrate a satisfying performance gain by incorporating our RPE methods across many architectures. Our results provide fresh perspectives on designing spiking Transformers to advance their sequential modeling capability, thereby expanding their applicability across various domains.</p></details> |  | None |

What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated its effectiveness in both image classification and neuroscience forecasting tasks. Combining human judgments with one or more machines consistently improved overall team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Single Domain Generalization of LiDAR-based Semantic Segmentation under Imperfect Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09035v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

While recent defenses in image classification have successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient, as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks: super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation.</p></details> |  | None |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Boundaries of Fair AI in Medical Image Prognosis: A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08840v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE, the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE) prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts, underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for more robust, equitable prognostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

While this approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization (SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity remains challenging for a satisfactory user experience. To this end, this paper proposes the design of a smart glasses platform for always-on on-device object detection with an all-day battery lifetime. The proposed platform is based on GAP9, a novel multi-core RISC-V processor from Greenwaves Technologies. Additionally, a family of sub-million parameter TinyissimoYOLO networks are proposed. They are benchmarked on established datasets, capable of differentiating up to 80 classes on MS-COCO. Evaluations on the smart glasses prototype demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's inference latency of only 17ms and consuming 1.59mJ energy per inference. An end-to-end latency of 56ms is achieved which is equivalent to 18 frames per seconds (FPS) with a total power consumption of 62.9mW. This ensures continuous system runtime of up to 9.3 hours on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 FPS, while the 18 FPS achieved in this paper even include image-capturing, network inference, and detection post-processing.

The result is a greater cost on time, hardware, and environmental resources.

However, training these architectures from scratch remains resource-intensive (e.g., in terms of data and time). Motivated by this challenge, we explore a cross-architecture knowledge transfer paradigm, termed TransMamba, that facilitates the reuse of Transformer pre-trained knowledge. We propose a two-stage framework to accelerate the training of Mamba-based models, ensuring their effectiveness across both uni-modal and multi-modal tasks. The first stage leverages pre-trained Transformer models to initialize critical components of the Mamba architecture. To bridge architectural and dimensional gaps, we develop a selective weight subcloning strategy and a layered initialization scheme that prioritizes the early $n$ layers. Building on this initialization, the second stage introduces an adaptive multi-directional knowledge distillation method. This mechanism employs layer-wise adaptive scaling factors to align Mamba representations with their Transformer counterparts, while accommodating the scanning order variations inherent to multi-modal Mamba architectures. Despite operating with a reduced training dataset and a more compact model architecture, TransMamba consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse mamba-based backbones (e.g., PlainMamba, Vmamba, ViM and VideoMamba) and downstream tasks (e.g., image classification, visual question answering, text-video retrieval and multimodal reasoning).

Despite offering advantages like negligible computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP (Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025</p></details> | None |

Due to the limited availability of high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically augmented HSI classification models.

Convolutional neural networks are effectively used for real versus bogus classification; however, their reliance on opaque latent representations hinders interpretability. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) can approach the performance level of a convolutional neural network on three optical transient survey datasets (Pan-STARRS, MeerLICHT and ATLAS) while simultaneously producing direct, human-readable descriptions for every candidate. Using only 15 examples and concise instructions, Google's LLM, Gemini, achieves a 93% average accuracy across datasets that span a range of resolution and pixel scales. We also show that a second LLM can assess the coherence of the output of the first model, enabling iterative refinement by identifying problematic cases. This framework allows users to define the desired classification behaviour through natural language and examples, bypassing traditional training pipelines. Furthermore, by generating textual descriptions of observed features, LLMs enable users to query classifications as if navigating an annotated catalogue, rather than deciphering abstract latent spaces. As next-generation telescopes and surveys further increase the amount of data available, LLM-based classification could help bridge the gap between automated detection and transparent, human-level understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nature Astronomy (2025).

A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting. To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization (MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and effectiveness.

By replacing self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets, its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images. Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the necessary cross-channel interactions.

These approaches learn additional embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based IL in IOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV Workshops 2025: v2 update affiliation</p></details> | None |
| **[Leveraging Vision Transformers for Enhanced Classification of Emotions using ECG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05826v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical signals provide insights into various conditions affecting the human body. Beyond diagnostic capabilities, these signals offer a deeper understanding of how specific organs respond to an individual's emotions and feelings. For instance, ECG data can reveal changes in heart rate variability linked to emotional arousal, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system activity. This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our emotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional approaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which surpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. We begin by assessing the effectiveness of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a forefront model in image classification, for identifying emotions in imaged ECGs. Following this, we present and evaluate an improved version of ViT, integrating both CNN and SE blocks, aiming to bolster performance on imaged ECGs associated with emotion detection. Our method unfolds in two critical phases: first, we apply advanced preprocessing techniques for signal purification and converting signals into interpretable images using continuous wavelet transform and power spectral density analysis; second, we unveil a performance-boosted vision transformer architecture, cleverly enhanced with convolutional neural network components, to adeptly tackle the challenges of emotion recognition. Our methodology's robustness and innovation were thoroughly tested using ECG data from the YAAD and DREAMER datasets, leading to remarkable outcomes. For the YAAD dataset, our approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in classifying seven unique emotional states, as well as in valence and arousal classification. Similarly, in the DREAMER dataset, our method excelled in distinguishing between valence, arousal and dominance, surpassing current leading techniques.</p></details> | 14pages, 2 figures | None |

Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle (n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present ("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive). Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50. Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233, elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each). Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results: Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive (e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets (elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence the performance of these models.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures | None |

This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data, enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification, we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2), which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and industrial domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14815v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content. Despite increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but they suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled models trained with curated concept datasets and 771 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. Evaluation results show that PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18 - 40X compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted at CCS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here, we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL) features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of 0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC 0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79) and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[A Semantics-Aware Hierarchical Self-Supervised Approach to Classification of Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04916v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing image classification tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[ERDE: Entropy-Regularized Distillation for Early-exit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04856v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques: early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other contexts.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Medical Image Classification with KAN-Integrated Transformers and Dilated Neighborhood Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13693v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

In the context of the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method. However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach (ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, paper accepted to present at CIARP 2025</p></details> | None |

Numerous feature fusion techniques address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity. In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing Mamba-based approaches often overlook the directional modeling heterogeneity across different land-cover types, leading to limited classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMoE, a novel spectral-spatial Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, which represents the first MoE-based approach in the HSI classification domain. Specifically, we design a Mixture of Mamba Expert Block (MoMEB) that performs adaptive spectral-spatial feature modeling via a sparse expert activation mechanism. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-guided corrective learning (UGCL) strategy that encourages the model to focus on complex regions prone to prediction ambiguity. This strategy dynamically samples supervision signals from regions with high predictive uncertainty, guiding the model to adaptively refine feature representations and thereby enhancing its focus on challenging areas. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public HSI benchmark datasets show that MambaMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing advanced methods, particularly Mamba-based ones.

However, their large size and computational complexity present significant challenges for deploying them in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents an innovative approach for integrating Mamba Architecture within a Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) process to address the challenge of reducing model complexity while maintaining accuracy in image classification tasks. The proposed framework distills a large teacher model into progressively smaller student models, designed using Mamba blocks. Each student model is trained using Selective-State-Space Models (S-SSM) within the Mamba blocks, focusing on important input aspects while reducing computational complexity. The work's preliminary experiments use MNIST and CIFAR-10 as datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. For MNIST, the teacher model achieves 98% accuracy. A set of seven student models as a group retained 63% of the teacher's FLOPs, approximating the teacher's performance with 98% accuracy. The weak student used only 1% of the teacher's FLOPs and maintained 72% accuracy. Similarly, for CIFAR-10, the students achieved 1% less accuracy compared to the teacher, with the small student retaining 5% of the teacher's FLOPs to achieve 50% accuracy. These results confirm the flexibility and scalability of Mamba Architecture, which can be integrated into PKD, succeeding in the process of finding students as weak learners. The framework provides a solution for deploying complex neural networks in real-time applications with a reduction in computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of this work was presented as a short poster titled "Mamba-PKD: A Framework for Efficient and Scalable Model Compression in Image Classification" at The 40th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing https://doi.org/10.1145/3672608.3707887</p></details> | None |

The method builds upon an adversarially-trained classifier, and learns to map its internal representation associated with a potentially perturbed input onto a distribution of tentative clean reconstructions. Multiple samples from such distribution are classified by the same adversarially-trained model, and a carefully chosen aggregation of its outputs finally constitutes the robust prediction of interest. Experimental evaluation by a well-established benchmark of strong adaptive attacks, across different image datasets, shows that CARSO is able to defend itself against adaptive end-to-end white-box attacks devised for stochastic defences. Paying a modest clean accuracy toll, our method improves by a significant margin the state-of-the-art for Cifar-10, Cifar-100, and TinyImageNet-200 $\ell_\infty$ robust classification accuracy against AutoAttack.

Interpretability is crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent, concept-level explanations.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures | None |

At the core of their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

These are made possible by a specialized retinal region called the fovea, which provides high acuity at the center of vision while maintaining lower resolution in the periphery. This distinctive spatial organization, preserved along the early visual pathway through retinotopic mapping, is fundamental to biological vision, yet remains largely unexplored in machine learning. Our study investigates how incorporating foveated retinotopy may benefit deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. By implementing a foveated retinotopic transformation in the input layer of standard ResNet models and re-training them, we maintain comparable classification accuracy while enhancing the network's robustness to scale and rotational perturbations. Although this architectural modification introduces increased sensitivity to fixation point shifts, we demonstrate how this apparent limitation becomes advantageous: variations in classification probabilities across different gaze positions serve as effective indicators for object localization. Our findings suggest that foveated retinotopic mapping encodes implicit knowledge about visual object geometry, offering an efficient solution to the visual search problem - a capability crucial for many living species.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring the Hierarchical Reasoning Model for Small Natural-Image Classification Without Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03598v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches 65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains 77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model may allow it to improve greatly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust MRI Reconstruction by Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07784v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the popularity of deep learning (DL) in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to rise, recent research has indicated that DL-based MRI reconstruction models might be excessively sensitive to minor input disturbances, including worst-case additive perturbations. This sensitivity often leads to unstable, aliased images. This raises the question of how to devise DL techniques for MRI reconstruction that can be robust to train-test variations. To address this problem, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning approach. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense approaches for image classification tasks. Yet, we find that the conventional design that applies RS to the entire DL-based MRI model is ineffective. In this paper, we show that SMUG and its variants address the above issue by customizing the RS process based on the unrolling architecture of a DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of instability sources, including worst-case and random noise perturbations to input measurements, varying measurement sampling rates, and different numbers of unrolling steps. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of our method in the presence of perturbations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Robust Clustered Federated Learning Approach for Non-IID Data with Quantity Skew](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03380v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized paradigm that enables a client-server architecture to collaboratively train a global Artificial Intelligence model without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy. A key challenge in FL is Non-IID data. Quantity Skew (QS) is a particular problem of Non-IID, where clients hold highly heterogeneous data volumes. Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) is an emergent variant of FL that presents a promising solution to Non-IID problem. It improves models' performance by grouping clients with similar data distributions into clusters. CFL methods generally fall into two operating strategies. In the first strategy, clients select the cluster that minimizes the local training loss. In the second strategy, the server groups clients based on local model similarities. However, most CFL methods lack systematic evaluation under QS but present significant challenges because of it. In this paper, we present two main contributions. The first one is an evaluation of state-of-the-art CFL algorithms under various Non-IID settings, applying multiple QS scenarios to assess their robustness. Our second contribution is a novel iterative CFL algorithm, named CORNFLQS, which proposes an optimal coordination between both operating strategies of CFL. Our approach is robust against the different variations of QS settings. We conducted intensive experiments on six image classification datasets, resulting in 270 Non-IID configurations. The results show that CORNFLQS achieves the highest average ranking in both accuracy and clustering quality, as well as strong robustness to QS perturbations. Overall, our approach outperforms actual CFL algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Test-Time Defense Against Adversarial Attacks via Stochastic Resonance of Latent Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03224v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks: imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing, which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free, architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time, establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

The study is based on the analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others. To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CBVLM: Training-free Explainable Concept-based Large Vision Language Models for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12266v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the model output on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least 8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about 4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our cost analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Knowledge Distillation Detection for Open-weights Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02302v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher, under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our approach is applicable to both classification and generative models. Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image generation.

While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Existing methods for this task either treat network parameters uniformly or rely on implicit weighting derived from Hessian approximations, which do not fully model functional heterogeneity of network parameters.

Our approach improves attribution accuracy across diverse tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and diffusion, and enables fine-grained attribution for concepts like subject and style.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Invisibility Cloak: Disappearance under Human Pose Estimation via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07670v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being significant in autonomous systems, Human Pose Estimation (HPE)'s potential risks to adversarial attacks have not received comparable attention with image classification or segmentation tasks. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of HPE systems to disappearance attacks, where the attacker aims to subtly alter the HPE training process via backdoor techniques so that any input image with some specific trigger will not be recognized as involving any human pose. As humans are typically at the center of HPE systems, a successful attack will severely threaten pedestrians' lives if a self-driving car incorrectly understands the front scene. To achieve the adversarial goal of disappearance, we propose \emph{IntC}, a general framework to craft an invisibility cloak in the HPE domain. By designing target HPE labels that do not represent any human pose, we propose three specific backdoor attacks based on our IntC framework. IntC-S and IntC-E, respectively designed for regression- and heatmap-based HPE techniques, concentrate the keypoints of triggered images in a tiny, imperceptible region. Further, to improve the attack's stealthiness, IntC-L designs the target poisons to capture the label outputs of typical landscape images without a human involved, achieving disappearance and reducing detectability simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our IntC methods in achieving the disappearance goal. By revealing the vulnerability of HPE to disappearance and backdoor attacks, we hope our work can raise awareness of the potential risks when HPE models are deployed in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accelerating Targeted Hard-Label Adversarial Attacks in Low-Query Black-Box Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16313v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper contains 10 pages, 8 figures and 8 tables.

However, it still lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$ and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training. To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one. It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA.

Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to 88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be applied to more complex and diverse datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SVDefense: Effective Defense against Gradient Inversion Attacks via Singular Value Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03319v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data but is vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), where adversaries reconstruct private data from shared gradients. Existing defenses either incur impractical computational overhead for embedded platforms or fail to achieve privacy protection and good model utility at the same time. Moreover, many defenses can be easily bypassed by adaptive adversaries who have obtained the defense details. To address these limitations, we propose SVDefense, a novel defense framework against GIAs that leverages the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obfuscate gradient updates. SVDefense introduces three key innovations, a Self-Adaptive Energy Threshold that adapts to client vulnerability, a Channel-Wise Weighted Approximation that selectively preserves essential gradient information for effective model training while enhancing privacy protection, and a Layer-Wise Weighted Aggregation for effective model aggregation under class imbalance. Our extensive evaluation shows that SVDefense outperforms existing defenses across multiple applications, including image classification, human activity recognition, and keyword spotting, by offering robust privacy protection with minimal impact on model accuracy. Furthermore, SVDefense is practical for deployment on various resource-constrained embedded platforms. We will make our code publicly available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gaussian DP for Reporting Differential Privacy Guarantees in Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10945v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current practices for reporting the level of differential privacy (DP) protection for machine learning (ML) algorithms such as DP-SGD provide an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of the privacy guarantees. For instance, if only a single $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ is known about a mechanism, standard analyses show that there exist highly accurate inference attacks against training data records, when, in fact, such accurate attacks might not exist. In this position paper, we argue that using non-asymptotic Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) as the primary means of communicating DP guarantees in ML avoids these potential downsides. Using two recent developments in the DP literature: (i) open-source numerical accountants capable of computing the privacy profile and $f$-DP curves of DP-SGD to arbitrary accuracy, and (ii) a decision-theoretic metric over DP representations, we show how to provide non-asymptotic bounds on GDP using numerical accountants, and show that GDP can capture the entire privacy profile of DP-SGD and related algorithms with virtually no error, as quantified by the metric. To support our claims, we investigate the privacy profiles of state-of-the-art DP large-scale image classification, and the TopDown algorithm for the U.S. Decennial Census, observing that GDP fits their profiles remarkably well in all cases. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and discuss which other privacy mechanisms could benefit from GDP.</p></details> |  | None |

This study investigates these decisions through a task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics, this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in transfer learning.</p></details> | Under review | None |

While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned binary class-level concept prototypes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the Workshop AIMLAI at ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> | None |

However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing among multiple data owners, and proprietary restrictions prevent the learning service provider (LSP) from sharing the FM. In this work, we propose BlindFed, a framework enabling collaborative FM adaptation while protecting both parties: data owners do not access the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see sensitive task data. BlindFed relies on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and consists of three key innovations: (i) FHE-friendly architectural modifications via polynomial approximations and low-rank adapters, (ii) a two-stage split learning approach combining offline knowledge distillation and online encrypted inference for adapter training without backpropagation through the FM, and (iii) a privacy-boosting scheme using sample permutations and stochastic block sampling to mitigate model extraction attacks. Empirical results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the BlindFed framework, albeit at a high communication cost and large computational complexity for the LSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, these methods generally ignore the communicative context of explanations, such as the preferences of a listener. For example, medical doctors understand explanations in terms of clinical markers, but patients may not, needing a different vocabulary to rationalize the same diagnosis. We address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the rational speech act. We introduce an iterative training procedure based on direct preference optimization where a speaker learns to compose explanations that maximize communicative utility for a listener. Our approach only needs access to pairwise preferences, which can be collected from human feedback, making it particularly relevant in real-world scenarios where a model of the listener may not be available. We demonstrate that our method is able to align speakers with the preferences of simulated listeners on image classification across three datasets, and further validate that pragmatic explanations generated with our method improve the classification accuracy of participants in a user study.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so-called adaptive edge of stability regime during training, leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, and damping oscillations. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam, we create a powerful hybrid optimizer. For this optimizer, we provide rigorous theoretical analysis of operation at the edge of stability from a physical and control perspective for the momentum. Furthermore, we derive convergence bounds with the rate $\mathcal{O}(\ln(N)/\sqrt{N})$ for a stochastic non convex objective under mild assumptions. We demonstrate that VRAdam exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.</p></details> | <details><summary>L.

While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly, ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG.

| **[MAPLE: Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25863v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI) classification by aligning visual features with textual representations, thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization. Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Conformal Guidance for Learning under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16736v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning systems. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a broadly applicable solution for learning under uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |

Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) builds image graphs by connecting patches (nodes) based on feature similarity, and is dynamically repeated in each ViG layer following GNN based patch (node) feature updates. However, DIGC constitutes over 50% of end to end ViG inference latency, rising to 95% at high image resolutions, making it the dominant computational bottleneck. While hardware acceleration holds promise, prior works primarily optimize graph construction algorithmically, often compromising DIGC flexibility, accuracy, or generality. To address these limitations, we propose a streaming, deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator for DIGC, featuring on chip buffers that process input features in small, uniform blocks. Our design minimizes external memory traffic via localized computation and performs efficient parallel sorting with local merge sort and global k way merging directly on streaming input blocks via heap insertion. This modular architecture scales seamlessly across image resolutions, ViG layer types, and model sizes and variants, and supports DIGC across diverse ViG based vision backbones. The design achieves high clock frequencies post place and route due to the statically configured parallelism minimizing critical path delay and delivers up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups over optimized CPU and GPU DIGC baselines.</p></details> | IEEE HPEC 2025 | None |

These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations.

| **[Interpretable 3D Neural Object Volumes for Robust Conceptual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13429v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of deep neural networks, especially in safety-critical applications, robustness and interpretability are crucial to ensure their trustworthiness. Recent advances in 3D-aware classifiers that map image features to volumetric representation of objects, rather than relying solely on 2D appearance, have greatly improved robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Such classifiers have not yet been studied from the perspective of interpretability. Meanwhile, current concept-based XAI methods often neglect OOD robustness. We aim to address both aspects with CAVE - Concept Aware Volumes for Explanations - a new direction that unifies interpretability and robustness in image classification. We design CAVE as a robust and inherently interpretable classifier that learns sparse concepts from 3D object representation. We further propose 3D Consistency (3D-C), a metric to measure spatial consistency of concepts. Unlike existing metrics that rely on human-annotated parts on images, 3D-C leverages ground-truth object meshes as a common surface to project and compare explanations across concept-based methods. CAVE achieves competitive classification performance while discovering consistent and meaningful concepts across images in various OOD settings.

However, traditional methods struggle when source and target domains differ, as in domain adaptation, due to their inability to address domain gaps. This paper introduces GenMix, a generalizable prompt-guided generative data augmentation approach that enhances both in-domain and cross-domain image classification. Our technique leverages image editing to generate augmented images based on custom conditional prompts, designed specifically for each problem type. By blending portions of the input image with its edited generative counterpart and incorporating fractal patterns, our approach mitigates unrealistic images and label ambiguity, improving the performance and adversarial robustness of the resulting models. Efficacy of our method is established with extensive experiments on eight public datasets for general and fine-grained classification, in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Additionally, we demonstrate performance improvements for self-supervised learning, learning with data scarcity, and adversarial robustness. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, our technique achieves stronger performance across the board.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://diffusemix.github.io/</p></details> | None |

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output feature quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating their superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

However, in fine-grained image classification, assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value. DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Dataset distillation offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets. Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states, overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets.

This paper explores the introduction of quadratic transformations to further increase nonlinearity in neural networks, with the aim of enhancing the performance of existing architectures. To reduce parameter complexity and computational complexity, we propose a lightweight quadratic enhancer that uses low-rankness, weight sharing, and sparsification techniques. For a fixed architecture, the proposed approach introduces quadratic interactions between features at every layer, while only adding negligible amounts of additional model parameters and forward computations. We conduct a set of proof-of-concept experiments for the proposed method across three tasks: image classification, text classification, and fine-tuning large-language models. In all tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates clear and substantial performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

The most useful outcome is a singleton prediction-an unambiguous decision-yet existing efficiency-oriented methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a new nonconformity score that aims to minimize the probability of producing non-singleton sets. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency (sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on average set size.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging the Task Gap: Multi-Task Adversarial Transferability in CLIP and Its Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23917v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models, without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores. Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures | None |

Existing methods often tie the structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy, specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI).

None of them are supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions. It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be made available after acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, comments welcome</p></details> | None |

Deep metric learning frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on $\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Diagnosing and Mitigating Modality Interference in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19616v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals -- particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering -- which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem -- the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks -- such as image classification or pure text question answering -- where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem, and we further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to finetune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations, and a consistency regularization strategy applying on model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy and multimodal tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0 model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0 achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58 percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility.

| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent approaches have explored generating synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025.

However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

In the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent, even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes and different modalities.

To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M FLOPs) at IoT device.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, PIMRC Conference 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs, encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search.

However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge: severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness. Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for achieving these gains.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure | None |
| **[Filtering with Confidence: When Data Augmentation Meets Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21479v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications, synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical: effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection, showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spectral Graph Neural Networks are Incomplete on Graphs with a Simple Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05530v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 10 pages main text | None |

We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CBMI 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix) |

This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting.

However, extending these models from static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos, which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes, or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Nowadays, such ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that collects millions of plant image queries all over the world.

However, existing QAT-KD methods often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals, improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models (SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Current bias mitigation methods usually either achieve high level of fairness with the degradation of accuracy, or only improve the model fairness on a single attribute. Additionally usually most bias mitigation strategies are either pre hoc through data processing or post hoc through fairness evaluation, instead of being integrated into the model learning itself. To solve these existing drawbacks, we propose a new Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin tone normalization and data augmentation method that directly feeds into an adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework. In skin tone normalization, ITA is used to estimate skin tone type and adjust automatically to target tones for dataset balancing. In the joint channel pruning framework, two nested optimization loops are used to find critical channels.The inner optimization loop finds and prunes the local critical channels by weighted soft nearest neighbor loss, and the outer optimization loop updates the weight of each attribute using group wise variance loss on meta-set. Experiments conducted in the ISIC2019 dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in simultaneously improving the fairness of the model on multiple sensitive attributes without significant degradation of accuracy. Finally, although the pruning mechanism adds some computational cost during training phase, usually training is done off line. More importantly,</p></details> | 29pages, 12 figures | None |

By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> | None |

However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack (calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest the need for robust defenses.

Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset, referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent, lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present a novel sponge attack called SkipSponge. SkipSponge is the first sponge attack that is performed directly on the parameters of a pretrained model using only a few data samples. Our experiments show that SkipSponge can successfully increase the energy consumption of image classification models, GANs, and autoencoders, requiring fewer samples than the state-of-the-art sponge attacks (Sponge Poisoning). We show that poisoning defenses are ineffective if not adjusted specifically for the defense against SkipSponge (i.e., they decrease target layer bias values) and that SkipSponge is more effective on the GANs and the autoencoders than Sponge Poisoning. Additionally, SkipSponge is stealthy as it does not require significant changes to the victim model's parameters. Our experiments indicate that SkipSponge can be performed even when an attacker has access to less than 1% of the entire training dataset and reaches up to 13% energy increase.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) 2025</p></details> | None |

The goal was to assess whether general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers, and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis: (RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2) classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset, where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows, suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the study to other classification strategies and models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures | None |

Conventional mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures suffer from suboptimal coordination dynamics, where isolated expert operations expose the model to overfitting risks. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention blocks, which limits further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes the transformer model into an equivalent group of experts and applies a hierarchical routing mechanism to allocate input subspaces to specialized experts. Our approach advances MoE design with four key innovations: (1) Constructing expert groups by partitioning non-MoE models into functionally equivalent specialists (2) Developing a hierarchical routing paradigm that integrates patch-wise data selection and expert selection strategies. (3) Extending the MoE design to attention blocks. (4) Proposing a hardware-optimized parallelization scheme that exploits batched matrix multiplications for efficient expert computation. The experiments demonstrate that our UoE model surpasses Full Attention, state-of-the-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains. In language modeling tasks, UoE achieves an average reduction of 2.38 in perplexity compared to the best-performing MoE method with only 76% of its FLOPs. In the Long Range Arena benchmark, it demonstrates an average score at least 0.68% higher than all comparison models, with only 50% of the FLOPs of the best MoE method. In image classification, it yields an average accuracy improvement of 1.75% over the best model while maintaining comparable FLOPs.

| **[Lightweight Vision Transformer with Window and Spatial Attention for Food Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18692v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%, respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and classification performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ZoDIAC: Zoneout Dropout Injection Attention Calculation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14263v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past few years the transformer model has been utilized for a variety of tasks such as image captioning, image classification natural language generation, and natural language understanding. As a key component of the transformer model, self-attention calculates the attention values by mapping the relationships among the head elements of the source and target sequence, yet there is no explicit mechanism to refine and intensify the attention values with respect to the context of the input and target sequences. Based on this intuition, we introduce a novel refine and intensify attention mechanism that is called Zoneup Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC), in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input source and target sequences are first refined using GELU and dropout and then intensified using a proposed zoneup process which includes the injection of a learned scalar factor. Our extensive experiments show that ZoDIAC achieves statistically significant higher scores under all image captioning metrics using various feature extractors in comparison to the conventional self-attention module in the transformer model on the MS-COCO dataset. Our proposed ZoDIAC attention modules can be used as a drop-in replacement for the attention components in all transformer models.

Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Elucidating the Design Space of FP4 training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17791v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of foundation models have spurred research into low-precision training, with 4-bit floating-point (\texttt{FP4}) formats emerging as a frontier for maximizing hardware throughput. While numerous techniques have been proposed to stabilize \texttt{FP4} training, they often present isolated solutions with varying, and not always clear, computational overheads. This paper aims to provide a unified view of the design space of \texttt{FP4} training. We introduce a comprehensive, quantisation gradient-based framework for microscaling quantization that allows for a theoretical analysis of the computational costs associated with different stabilization methods on both the forward and backward passes. Using a simulator built on this framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, image classification, diffusion models, and language models. By systematically evaluating thousands of combinations of techniques, such as novel gradient approximations, rounding strategies, and scaling methods, we identify which configurations offer the most favourable performance-to-overhead trade-off. We find that the techniques enabling the best trade-off involve carefully combining Hadamard transformations, tensor scaling and stochastic rounding. We further find that using \texttt{UE5M3} as a scaling factor potentially offers a good compromise between range and precision with manageable computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical-Prompt for Class-Imbalance Multi-Label Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17747v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world datasets often exhibit class imbalance across multiple categories, manifesting as long-tailed distributions and few-shot scenarios. This is especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification (CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically, HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP improvements of 10.0\% and 5.2\% on the long-tailed multi-label image classification task, and 6.8\% and 2.9\% on the multi-label few-shot image classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> | None |

However, existing MCoT methods rely on rationale-rich datasets and largely focus on inter-object reasoning, overlooking the intra-object understanding crucial for image classification. To address this gap, we propose WISE, a Weak-supervision-guided Step-by-step Explanation method that augments any image classification dataset with MCoTs by reformulating the concept-based representations from Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) into concise, interpretable reasoning chains under weak supervision. Experiments across ten datasets show that our generated MCoTs not only improve interpretability by 37% but also lead to gains in classification accuracy when used to fine-tune MLLMs. Our work bridges concept-based interpretability and generative MCoT reasoning, providing a generalizable framework for enhancing MLLMs in fine-grained visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> | None |

To achieve the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning" framework for multimodal semi-supervised medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods.

To address this challenge, we propose HyperTTA (Test-Time Adaptable Transformer for Hyperspectral Degradation), a unified framework that enhances model robustness under diverse degradation conditions. First, we construct a multi-degradation hyperspectral benchmark that systematically simulates nine representative degradations, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robust classification. Based on this benchmark, we develop a Spectral--Spatial Transformer Classifier (SSTC) with a multi-level receptive field mechanism and label smoothing regularization to capture multi-scale spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight test-time adaptation strategy, the Confidence-aware Entropy-minimized LayerNorm Adapter (CELA), which dynamically updates only the affine parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This strategy ensures reliable adaptation without access to source data or target labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios. Code will be made available publicly.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%, representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67% and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Word ...</summary><p>Word count: 5157, Table count: 2, Figure count: 5</p></details> | None |

We establish the first reproducible baseline for solar filament chirality classification on the MAGFiLO dataset. The MAGFiLO dataset contains over 10,000 manually-annotated filaments from GONG H-Alpha observations, making it the largest dataset for filament detection and classification to date. Prior studies relied on much smaller datasets, which limited their generalizability and comparability. We fine-tuned several pre-trained, image classification architectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, ResNeXt, and ConvNeXt, and also applied data augmentation and per-class loss weights to optimize the models. Our best model, ConvNeXtBase, achieves a per-class accuracy of 0.69 for left chirality filaments and $0.73$ for right chirality filaments.</p></details> |  | None |

We study the black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix $A \in R^{k \times n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors $v \in R^n$ to lower-dimensional sketches $A v \in R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain approximate $\ell_2$-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch. We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using $\tilde{O}(k^2)$ queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution (used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching matrix and to the estimator: it applies to any linear sketch and any query responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the query distribution. Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of $\tilde{\Omega}(k^2)$, achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification, highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.</p></details> |  | None |

Critically, FiD-GP relies on normalising-flow priors and spectral regularisations to augment its expressiveness and align the inducing subspace with feature-gradient geometry through a numerically stable projection mechanism objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction framework in FiD-GP can help to design a single-pass projection for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection. Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression, image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude, compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 1st MICCAI Workshop on Efficient Medical AI 2025</p></details> | None |

This chapter provides comprehensive architectural analysis of BCFL systems through a systematic four-dimensional taxonomy examining coordination structures, consensus mechanisms, storage architectures, and trust models. We analyze design patterns from blockchain-verified centralized coordination to fully decentralized peer-to-peer networks, evaluating trade-offs in scalability, security, and performance. Through detailed examination of consensus mechanisms designed for federated learning contexts, including Proof of Quality and Proof of Federated Learning, we demonstrate how computational work can be repurposed from arbitrary cryptographic puzzles to productive machine learning tasks. The chapter addresses critical storage challenges by examining multi-tier architectures that balance blockchain's transaction constraints with neural networks' large parameter requirements while maintaining cryptographic integrity. A technical case study of the TrustMesh framework illustrates practical implementation considerations in BCFL systems through distributed image classification training, demonstrating effective collaborative learning across IoT devices with highly non-IID data distributions while maintaining complete transparency and fault tolerance.

However, existing CFE methods often rely on additional image encoders and generative models to create plausible images, neglecting the classifier's own feature space and decision boundaries. As such, they do not explain the intrinsic feature space and decision boundaries learned by the classifier. To address this limitation, we propose Mirror-CFE, a novel method that generates faithful counterfactual explanations by operating directly in the classifier's feature space, treating decision boundaries as mirrors that ``reflect'' feature representations in the mirror. Mirror-CFE learns a mapping function from feature space to image space while preserving distance relationships, enabling smooth transitions between source images and their counterfactuals. Through extensive experiments on four image datasets, we demonstrate that Mirror-CFE achieves superior performance in validity while maintaining input resemblance compared to state-of-the-art explanation methods. Finally, mirror-CFE provides interpretable visualization of the classifier's decision process by generating step-wise transitions that reveal how features evolve as classification confidence changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2025</p></details> | None |

This approach is motivated by the fact that commonly used gradient-based optimization methods can suffer from the barren plateaus problem. PSO is a stochastic optimization technique inspired by the collective behavior of a swarm of birds. The dimension of the swarm, the number of iterations of the algorithm, and the number of trainable parameters can be set. In this study, PSO has been used to train the entire structure of VQCs, allowing it to select which quantum gates to apply, the target qubits, and the rotation angle, in case a rotation is chosen. The algorithm is restricted to choosing from four types of gates: Rx, Ry, Rz, and CNOT. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on various datasets of the MedMNIST, which is a collection of biomedical image datasets designed for image classification tasks. Performance has been compared with the results achieved by classical stochastic gradient descent applied to a predefined VQC. The results show that the PSO can achieve comparable or even better classification accuracy across multiple datasets, despite the PSO using a lower number of quantum gates than the VQC used with gradient descent optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

This is a critical task for market organization with a tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient. Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification performance. The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset generalization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking in RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking is crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT without thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate No-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types. Experimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or matches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may hinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate this effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to explore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an Adaptive-Thinking method. Experiments show that it converges to a specific prompt depending on model capability and task complexity, achieving comparable or better performance than both Thinking and No-Thinking-RL. This suggests MLLMs can adaptively decide to think or not based on their capabilities and task complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2025 Spotlight</p></details> | None |

Within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer, training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer would generate an idealized dynamical trajectory. The idealized trajectory is designed to reproduce the activations of a neural network trained to perform the desired computation. This teacher-student scheme results in a thermodynamic computer whose finite-time dynamics enacts a computation analogous to that of the neural network. The parameters identified in this way can be implemented in the hardware realization of the thermodynamic computer, which will perform the desired computation automatically, driven by thermal noise. We demonstrate the method on a standard image-classification task, and estimate the thermodynamic advantage -- the ratio of energy costs of the digital and thermodynamic implementations -- to exceed seven orders of magnitude. Our results establish gradient descent as a viable training method for thermodynamic computing, enabling application of the core methodology of machine learning to this emerging field.</p></details> |  | None |

An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.</p></details> | 24 pages, XAI 2025 | None |

To explore the potential of perceptually motivated inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i) incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MARIC: Multi-Agent Reasoning for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14860v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs) alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step, producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and interpretable image classification.</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[Self Identity Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks. We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection.

Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed, multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification, text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead, hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single, general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over 15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times, with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5 Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over advertising data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The M-PACE framework uses a "mother-child" AI model system to automate and unify compliance checks for ads, reducing costs while maintaining high accuracy</p></details> | None |

We unify these directions by introducing quantum variational activation functions (QVAFs), realized through single-qubit data re-uploading circuits called DatA Re-Uploading ActivatioNs (DARUANs). We show that DARUAN with trainable weights in data pre-processing possesses an exponentially growing frequency spectrum with data repetitions, enabling an exponential reduction in parameter size compared with Fourier-based activations without loss of expressivity. Embedding DARUAN into KANs yields quantum-inspired KANs (QKANs), which retain the interpretability of KANs while improving their parameter efficiency, expressivity, and generalization. We further introduce two novel techniques to enhance scalability, feasibility and computational efficiency, such as layer extension and hybrid QKANs (HQKANs) as drop-in replacements of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for feed-forward networks in large-scale models. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on function regression, image classification, and autoregressive generative language modeling, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of QKANs. DARUANs and QKANs offer a promising direction for advancing quantum machine learning on both noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and classical quantum simulators.</p></details> | 45 pages | None |

The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NON A...</summary><p>NON ARCHIVAL PRESENTATION 1st workshop on Dataset Distillation CVPR 2024</p></details> | None |

Ablation studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI applications.

This study introduces spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for accurate medical image classification with limited, diverse datasets. The models include SBTAYLOR-KAN, integrating B-splines with Taylor series; SBRBF-KAN, combining B-splines with Radial Basis Functions; and SBWAVELET-KAN, embedding B-splines in Morlet wavelet transforms. These approaches leverage spline-based function approximation to capture both local and global nonlinearities. The models were evaluated on brain MRI, chest X-rays, tuberculosis X-rays, and skin lesion images without preprocessing, demonstrating the ability to learn directly from raw data. Extensive experiments, including cross-dataset validation and data reduction analysis, showed strong generalization and stability. SBTAYLOR-KAN achieved up to 98.93% accuracy, with a balanced F1-score, maintaining over 86% accuracy using only 30% of the training data across three datasets. Despite class imbalance in the skin cancer dataset, experiments on both imbalanced and balanced versions showed SBTAYLOR-KAN outperforming other models, achieving 68.22% accuracy. Unlike traditional CNNs, which require millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet50 with 24.18M), SBTAYLOR-KAN achieves comparable performance with just 2,872 trainable parameters, making it more suitable for constrained medical environments. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used for interpretability, highlighting relevant regions in medical images. This framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable solution for medical image classification, addressing the challenges of limited datasets and data-scarce scenarios in clinical AI applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Lookup Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13662v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks are constructed with massive operations with different types and are highly computationally intensive. Among these operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and usually requires {more} energy consumption with longer inference time than other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks (both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both images and point clouds).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD: Robust and Efficient Data-Parallel Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18454v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and continue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven developtment of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD (PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023), designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR | None |

However, in real-world FL settings, client data is often non-identically distributed and imbalanced, resulting in statistical data heterogeneity which impacts the generalization capabilities of the server's model across clients, slows convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing first a characterization of statistical data heterogeneity by means of 6 metrics of global and client attribute imbalance, class imbalance, and spurious correlations. Next, we create and share 7 computer vision datasets for binary and multiclass image classification tasks in Federated Learning that cover a broad range of statistical data heterogeneity and hence simulate real-world situations. Finally, we propose FEDDIVERSE, a novel client selection algorithm in FL which is designed to manage and leverage data heterogeneity across clients by promoting collaboration between clients with complementary data distributions. Experiments on the seven proposed FL datasets demonstrate FEDDIVERSE's effectiveness in enhancing the performance and robustness of a variety of FL methods while having low communication and computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>3rd I...</summary><p>3rd IEEE International Conference on Federated Learning Technologies and Applications (FLTA 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, the limited availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives. These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12917v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth) models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.</p></details> |  | None |

These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we present a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.</p></details> | Technical report | None |

This paper explores strategies for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose TED pruning, a method that addresses the challenge of overfitting under high pruning ratios by quantifying the model's ability to improve performance on pruned data while fitting retained data, known as Internal Generalization (IG). TED uses an optimization objective based on Internal Generalization Distance (IGD), measuring changes in IG before and after pruning to align with true generalization performance and achieve implicit regularization. The IGD optimization objective was verified to allow the model to achieve the smallest upper bound on generalization error. The impact of small mask fluctuations on IG is studied through masks and Taylor approximation, and fast estimation of IGD is enabled. In analyzing continuous training dynamics, the prior effect of IGD is validated, and a progressive pruning strategy is proposed. Experiments on image classification, natural language understanding, and large language model fine-tuning show TED achieves lossless performance with 60-70\% of the data. Upon acceptance, our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | ECAI 2024 | None |

However, their considerable parameter size restricts their applicability, particularly on mobile devices. Due to the dynamic and intricate nature of gradients on TM compared to Convolutional Neural Networks, commonly used pruning methods tend to retain weights with larger gradient noise. This results in pruned models that are sensitive to sparsity and datasets, exhibiting suboptimal performance. Symbolic Descent (SD) is a general approach for training and fine-tuning TM. In this paper, we attempt to describe the noisy batch gradient sequences on TM through the cumulative process of SD. We utilize this design to dynamically assess the importance scores of weights.SEVEN is introduced by us, which particularly favors weights with consistently high sensitivity, i.e., weights with small gradient noise. These weights are tended to be preserved by SEVEN. Extensive experiments on various TM in natural language, question-answering, and image classification domains are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SEVEN. The results demonstrate significant improvements of SEVEN in multiple pruning scenarios and across different sparsity levels. Additionally, SEVEN exhibits robust performance under various fine-tuning strategies.

We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling.

The proposed algorithm can be viewed as an extension of the Jacobi eigenvalue method for symmetric matrices diagonalization to the case where we want to approximate just a few extreme eigenvalues/eigenvectors. The method is also particularly well-suited for the computation of sparse approximations of the eigenvectors. In fact, we show that in general, our method provides a trade-off between the sparsity of the computed approximate eigenspaces and their accuracy. We provide theoretical results that show the linear convergence of the proposed method. Finally, we show experimental numerical results for sparse low-rank approximations of random symmetric matrices and show applications to graph Fourier transforms, and the sparse principal component analysis in image classification experiments. These applications are chosen because, in these cases, there is no need to perform the eigenvalue decomposition to high precision to achieve good numerical results.</p></details> |  | None |

The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\% (STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%, 32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%) and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g., 21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\% robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization (9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

A key reason for this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations. Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware, resilient representations.</p></details> | 12pages, 4 figures | None |

The most common way of representing skin tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact (on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and 5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better represents the diversity of human skin tones.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Seeing the Undefined: Chain-of-Action for Generative Semantic Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17406v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image classification by leveraging predefined sets of labels to construct text prompts for zero-shot reasoning. However, these approaches face significant limitations in undefined domains, where the label space is vocabulary-unknown and composite. We thus introduce Generative Semantic Labels (GSLs), a novel task that aims to predict a comprehensive set of semantic labels for an image without being constrained by a predefined labels set. Unlike traditional zero-shot classification, GSLs generates multiple semantic-level labels, encompassing objects, scenes, attributes, and relationships, thereby providing a richer and more accurate representation of image content. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Action (CoA), an innovative method designed to tackle the GSLs task. CoA is motivated by the observation that enriched contextual information significantly improves generative performance during inference. Specifically, CoA decomposes the GSLs task into a sequence of detailed actions. Each action extracts and merges key information from the previous step, passing enriched context to the next, ultimately guiding the VLM to generate comprehensive and accurate semantic labels. We evaluate the effectiveness of CoA through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements across key performance metrics, validating the capability of CoA to generate accurate and contextually rich semantic labels. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in generative semantic labels but also opens new avenues for applying VLMs in open-ended and dynamic real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures | None |

| **[Principled Approximation Methods for Efficient and Scalable Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00174v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints and non-differentiability. We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization, revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning. Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance.</p></details> | PhD thesis | None |
| **[A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the SB to various image classification tasks. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the target task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comparison and Evaluation of Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks to Large Language Models for Image Classification and Segmentation of Brain Tumors on MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10683v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks, specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors. Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined (e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance, robustness, and utility in the medical space.</p></details> |  | None |

The addition of calculated small distortion to images, for instance, can deceive a well-trained image classification network. In this work, we propose a novel attack technique called Sparse Adversarial and Interpretable Attack Framework (SAIF). Specifically, we design imperceptible attacks that contain low-magnitude perturbations at a small number of pixels and leverage these sparse attacks to reveal the vulnerability of classifiers. We use the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm to simultaneously optimize the attack perturbations for bounded magnitude and sparsity with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence. Empirical results show that SAIF computes highly imperceptible and interpretable adversarial examples, and outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attack methods on the ImageNet dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

To assess the quality of explainability methods, we approach the task through the lens of accuracy and stability. In this work, we make the following contributions. Firstly, we introduce the Weighting Game, which measures how much of a class-guided explanation is contained within the correct class' segmentation mask. Secondly, we introduce a metric for explanation stability, using zooming/panning transformations to measure differences between saliency maps with similar contents. Quantitative experiments are produced, using these new metrics, to evaluate the quality of explanations provided by commonly used CAM methods. The quality of explanations is also contrasted between different model architectures, with findings highlighting the need to consider model architecture when choosing an explainability method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: Image Analysis (SCIA 2025), Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), vol. 15726, pp. 325-338 (2025).

| **[Image Recognition with Vision and Language Embeddings of VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09311v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision that improves classification performance.

| **[CWSSNet: Hyperspectral Image Classification Enhanced by Wavelet Domain Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09163v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However, although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics. To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as the research area to perform ground object classification research. A classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%, and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies, vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level, indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample training conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EgoAgent: A Joint Predictive Agent Model in Egocentric Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05857v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning an agent model that behaves like humans-capable of jointly perceiving the environment, predicting the future, and taking actions from a first-person perspective-is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing methods typically train separate models for these abilities, which fail to capture their intrinsic relationships and prevent them from learning from each other. Inspired by how humans learn through the perception-action loop, we propose EgoAgent, a unified agent model that simultaneously learns to represent, predict, and act within a single transformer. EgoAgent explicitly models the causal and temporal dependencies among these abilities by formulating the task as an interleaved sequence of states and actions. It further introduces a joint embedding-action-prediction architecture with temporally asymmetric predictor and observer branches, enabling synergistic optimization across all three capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/zju3dv/EgoAgent.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the segmentation results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Combining Audio and Non-Audio Inputs in Evolved Neural Networks for Ovenbird](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10566v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last several years the use of neural networks as tools to automate species classification from digital data has increased. This has been due in part to the high classification accuracy of image classification through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of audio data CNN based recognizers are used to automate the classification of species in audio recordings by using information from sound visualization (i.e., spectrograms). It is common for these recognizers to use the spectrogram as their sole input. However, researchers have other non-audio data, such as habitat preferences of a species, phenology, and range information, available that could improve species classification. In this paper we present how a single-species recognizer neural network's accuracy can be improved by using non-audio data as inputs in addition to spectrogram information. We also analyze if the improvements are merely a result of having a neural network with a higher number of parameters instead of combining the two inputs. We find that networks that use the two different inputs have a higher classification accuracy than networks of similar size that use only one of the inputs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However, their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of transformers for small-scale vision.

| **[Have Large Vision-Language Models Mastered Art History?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03521v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has established new baselines in image classification across multiple domains. We examine whether their multimodal reasoning can also address a challenge mastered by human experts. Specifically, we test whether VLMs can classify the style, author and creation date of paintings, a domain traditionally mastered by art historians. Artworks pose a unique challenge compared to natural images due to their inherently complex and diverse structures, characterized by variable compositions and styles. This requires a contextual and stylistic interpretation rather than straightforward object recognition. Art historians have long studied the unique aspects of artworks, with style prediction being a crucial component of their discipline. This paper investigates whether large VLMs, which integrate visual and textual data, can effectively reason about the historical and stylistic attributes of paintings. We present the first study of its kind, conducting an in-depth analysis of three VLMs, namely CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4o, evaluating their zero-shot classification of art style, author and time period. Using two image benchmarks of artworks, we assess the models' ability to interpret style, evaluate their sensitivity to prompts, and examine failure cases. Additionally, we focus on how these models compare to human art historical expertise by analyzing misclassifications, providing insights into their reasoning and classification patterns.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UOPSL: Unpaired OCT Predilection Sites Learning for Fundus Image Diagnosis Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08624v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective, the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space. During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9 diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing benchmarks.</p></details> | BIBM | None |
| **[Beyond Distribution Shifts: Adaptive Hyperspectral Image Classification at Test Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08436v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise, blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme. Code will be made available publicly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosted Training of Lightweight Early Exits for Optimizing CNN Image Classification Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08318v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets. Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy" samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples. This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions. Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment, we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10 dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45 percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation. These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[SimCroP: Radiograph Representation Learning with Similarity-driven Cross-granularity Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08311v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However, in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then, similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports. The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods.
