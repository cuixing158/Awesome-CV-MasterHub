| **[A Preliminary Study for GPT-4o on Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05621v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenAI's GPT-4o model, integrating multi-modal inputs and outputs within an autoregressive architecture, has demonstrated unprecedented performance in image generation. In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the image restoration community. We present the first systematic evaluation of GPT-4o across diverse restoration tasks. Our experiments reveal that, although restoration outputs from GPT-4o are visually appealing, they often suffer from pixel-level structural fidelity when compared to ground-truth images. Common issues are variations in image proportions, shifts in object positions and quantities, and changes in viewpoint.To address it, taking image dehazing, derainning, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show that GPT-4o's outputs can serve as powerful visual priors, substantially enhancing the performance of existing dehazing networks. It offers practical guidelines and a baseline framework to facilitate the integration of GPT-4o into future image restoration pipelines. We hope the study on GPT-4o image restoration will accelerate innovation in the broader field of image generation areas. To support further research, we will release GPT-4o-restored images from over 10 widely used image restoration datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WDMamba: When Wavelet Degradation Prior Meets Vision Mamba for Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04369v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we reveal a novel haze-specific wavelet degradation prior observed through wavelet transform analysis, which shows that haze-related information predominantly resides in low-frequency components. Exploiting this insight, we propose a novel dehazing framework, WDMamba, which decomposes the image dehazing task into two sequential stages: low-frequency restoration followed by detail enhancement. This coarse-to-fine strategy enables WDMamba to effectively capture features specific to each stage of the dehazing process, resulting in high-quality restored images. Specifically, in the low-frequency restoration stage, we integrate Mamba blocks to reconstruct global structures with linear complexity, efficiently removing overall haze and producing a coarse restored image. Thereafter, the detail enhancement stage reinstates fine-grained information that may have been overlooked during the previous phase, culminating in the final dehazed output. Furthermore, to enhance detail retention and achieve more natural dehazing, we introduce a self-guided contrastive regularization during network training. By utilizing the coarse restored output as a hard negative example, our model learns more discriminative representations, substantially boosting the overall dehazing performance. Extensive evaluations on public dehazing benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.

| **[IDDM: Bridging Synthetic-to-Real Domain Gap from Physics-Guided Diffusion for Real-world Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21385v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the domain gap between real-world and synthetic hazy images, current data-driven dehazing algorithms trained on synthetic datasets perform well on synthetic data but struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{I}mage \textbf{D}ehazing \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels (IDDM), a novel diffusion process that incorporates the atmospheric scattering model into noise diffusion. IDDM aims to use the gradual haze formation process to help the denoising Unet robustly learn the distribution of clear images from the conditional input hazy images. We design a specialized training strategy centered around IDDM. Diffusion models are leveraged to bridge the domain gap from synthetic to real-world, while the atmospheric scattering model provides physical guidance for haze formation. During the forward process, IDDM simultaneously introduces haze and noise into clear images, and then robustly separates them during the sampling process. By training with physics-guided information, IDDM shows the ability of domain generalization, and effectively restores the real-world hazy images despite being trained on synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Tuning Adversarially-Robust Transformers for Single-Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17829v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-image dehazing is an important topic in remote sensing applications, enhancing the quality of acquired images and increasing object detection precision. However, the reliability of such structures has not been sufficiently analyzed, which poses them to the risk of imperceptible perturbations that can significantly hinder their performance. In this work, we show that state-of-the-art image-to-image dehazing transformers are susceptible to adversarial noise, with even 1 pixel change being able to decrease the PSNR by as much as 2.8 dB. Next, we propose two lightweight fine-tuning strategies aimed at increasing the robustness of pre-trained transformers. Our methods results in comparable clean performance, while significantly increasing the protection against adversarial data. We further present their applicability in two remote sensing scenarios, showcasing their robust behavior for out-of-distribution data.

| **[snnTrans-DHZ: A Lightweight Spiking Neural Network Architecture for Underwater Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11482v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater image dehazing is critical for vision-based marine operations because light scattering and absorption can severely reduce visibility. This paper introduces snnTrans-DHZ, a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) specifically designed for underwater dehazing. By leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs, snnTrans-DHZ efficiently processes time-dependent raw image sequences while maintaining low power consumption. Static underwater images are first converted into time-dependent sequences by repeatedly inputting the same image over user-defined timesteps. These RGB sequences are then transformed into LAB color space representations and processed concurrently. The architecture features three key modules: (i) a K estimator that extracts features from multiple color space representations; (ii) a Background Light Estimator that jointly infers the background light component from the RGB-LAB images; and (iii) a soft image reconstruction module that produces haze-free, visibility-enhanced outputs. The snnTrans-DHZ model is directly trained using a surrogate gradient-based backpropagation through time (BPTT) strategy alongside a novel combined loss function. Evaluated on the UIEB benchmark, snnTrans-DHZ achieves a PSNR of 21.68 dB and an SSIM of 0.8795, and on the EUVP dataset, it yields a PSNR of 23.46 dB and an SSIM of 0.8439. With only 0.5670 million network parameters, and requiring just 7.42 GSOPs and 0.0151 J of energy, the algorithm significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency. These features make snnTrans-DHZ highly suitable for deployment in underwater robotics, marine exploration, and environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoA: Towards Real Image Dehazing via Compression-and-Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05590v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based image dehazing algorithms have shown remarkable success in synthetic domains. However, real image dehazing is still in suspense due to computational resource constraints and the diversity of real-world scenes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an algorithm that excels in both efficiency and adaptability to address real image dehazing effectively. This work proposes a Compression-and-Adaptation (CoA) computational flow to tackle these challenges from a divide-and-conquer perspective. First, model compression is performed in the synthetic domain to develop a compact dehazing parameter space, satisfying efficiency demands. Then, a bilevel adaptation in the real domain is introduced to be fearless in unknown real environments by aggregating the synthetic dehazing capabilities during the learning process. Leveraging a succinct design free from additional constraints, our CoA exhibits domain-irrelevant stability and model-agnostic flexibility, effectively bridging the model chasm between synthetic and real domains to further improve its practical utility. Extensive evaluations and analyses underscore the approach's superiority and effectiveness.

| **[FriendNet: Detection-Friendly Dehazing Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04443v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather conditions often impair the quality of captured images, inevitably inducing cutting-edge object detection models for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. In this paper, we raise an intriguing question: can the combination of image restoration and object detection enhance detection performance in adverse weather conditions? To answer it, we propose an effective architecture that bridges image dehazing and object detection together via guidance information and task-driven learning to achieve detection-friendly dehazing, termed FriendNet. FriendNet aims to deliver both high-quality perception and high detection capacity. Different from existing efforts that intuitively treat image dehazing as pre-processing, FriendNet establishes a positive correlation between these two tasks. Clean features generated by the dehazing network potentially contribute to improvements in object detection performance. Conversely, object detection crucially guides the learning process of the image dehazing network under the task-driven learning scheme. We shed light on how downstream tasks can guide upstream dehazing processes, considering both network architecture and learning objectives. We design Guidance Fusion Block (GFB) and Guidance Attention Block (GAB) to facilitate the integration of detection information into the network. Furthermore, the incorporation of the detection task loss aids in refining the optimization process. Additionally, we introduce a new Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block (PFEB), which integrates physics-based priors to enhance the feature extraction and representation capabilities. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and detection precision.

| **[Iterative Predictor-Critic Code Decoding for Real-World Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13147v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel Iterative Predictor-Critic Code Decoding framework for real-world image dehazing, abbreviated as IPC-Dehaze, which leverages the high-quality codebook prior encapsulated in a pre-trained VQGAN. Apart from previous codebook-based methods that rely on one-shot decoding, our method utilizes high-quality codes obtained in the previous iteration to guide the prediction of the Code-Predictor in the subsequent iteration, improving code prediction accuracy and ensuring stable dehazing performance. Our idea stems from the observations that 1) the degradation of hazy images varies with haze density and scene depth, and 2) clear regions play crucial cues in restoring dense haze regions. However, it is non-trivial to progressively refine the obtained codes in subsequent iterations, owing to the difficulty in determining which codes should be retained or replaced at each iteration. Another key insight of our study is to propose Code-Critic to capture interrelations among codes. The Code-Critic is used to evaluate code correlations and then resample a set of codes with the highest mask scores, i.e., a higher score indicates that the code is more likely to be rejected, which helps retain more accurate codes and predict difficult ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods in real-world dehazing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Acceptted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning Hazing to Dehazing: Towards Realistic Haze Generation for Real-World Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19262v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing real-world image dehazing methods primarily attempt to fine-tune pre-trained models or adapt their inference procedures, thus heavily relying on the pre-trained models and associated training data. Moreover, restoring heavily distorted information under dense haze requires generative diffusion models, whose potential in dehazing remains underutilized partly due to their lengthy sampling processes. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel hazing-dehazing pipeline consisting of a Realistic Hazy Image Generation framework (HazeGen) and a Diffusion-based Dehazing framework (DiffDehaze). Specifically, HazeGen harnesses robust generative diffusion priors of real-world hazy images embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. By employing specialized hybrid training and blended sampling strategies, HazeGen produces realistic and diverse hazy images as high-quality training data for DiffDehaze. To alleviate the inefficiency and fidelity concerns associated with diffusion-based methods, DiffDehaze adopts an Accelerated Fidelity-Preserving Sampling process (AccSamp). The core of AccSamp is the Tiled Statistical Alignment Operation (AlignOp), which can provide a clean and faithful dehazing estimate within a small fraction of sampling steps to reduce complexity and enable effective fidelity guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior dehazing performance and visual quality of our approach over existing methods.

| **[Real-World Remote Sensing Image Dehazing: Benchmark and Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17966v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Image Dehazing (RSID) poses significant challenges in real-world scenarios due to the complex atmospheric conditions and severe color distortions that degrade image quality. The scarcity of real-world remote sensing hazy image pairs has compelled existing methods to rely primarily on synthetic datasets. However, these methods struggle with real-world applications due to the inherent domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address this, we introduce Real-World Remote Sensing Hazy Image Dataset (RRSHID), the first large-scale dataset featuring real-world hazy and dehazed image pairs across diverse atmospheric conditions. Based on this, we propose MCAF-Net, a novel framework tailored for real-world RSID. Its effectiveness arises from three innovative components: Multi-branch Feature Integration Block Aggregator (MFIBA), which enables robust feature extraction through cascaded integration blocks and parallel multi-branch processing; Color-Calibrated Self-Supervised Attention Module (CSAM), which mitigates complex color distortions via self-supervised learning and attention-guided refinement; and Multi-Scale Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (MFAFM), which integrates features effectively while preserving local details and global context. Extensive experiments validate that MCAF-Net demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in real-world RSID, while maintaining competitive performance on synthetic datasets. The introduction of RRSHID and MCAF-Net sets new benchmarks for real-world RSID research, advancing practical solutions for this complex task.

To mitigate this, we propose ProDehaze, a framework that employs internal image priors to direct external priors encoded in pretrained models. We introduce two types of \textit{selective} internal priors that prompt the model to concentrate on critical image areas: a Structure-Prompted Restorer in the latent space that emphasizes structure-rich regions, and a Haze-Aware Self-Correcting Refiner in the decoding process to align distributions between clearer input regions and the output. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ProDehaze achieves high-fidelity results in image dehazing, particularly in reducing color shifts.

| **[Scaling Up Single Image Dehazing Algorithm by Cross-Data Vision Alignment for Richer Representation Learning and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14823v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep neural networks tasks have increasingly relied on high-quality image inputs. With the development of high-resolution representation learning, the task of image dehazing has received significant attention. Previously, many methods collect diverse image data for large-scale training to boost the performance on a target scene. Ignoring the domain gap between different data, former de-hazing methods simply adopt multiple datasets for explicit large-scale training, which often makes the methods themselves be violated. To address this problem, we propose a novel method of cross-data vision alignment for richer representation learning to improve the existing dehazing methodology. Specifically, we call for the internal- and external knowledge should be further adapted with a self-supervised manner to fill up the domain gap. By using cross-data external alignment, the datasets inherit samples from different domains that are firmly aligned, making the model learn more robust and generalizable features. By using the internal augmentation method, the model can fully exploit local information within the images, and then obtaining more image details. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct training on the Natural Image Dataset (NID). Experimental results show that our method clearly resolves the domain gap in different dehazing datasets and presents a new pipeline for large-scale training in the dehazing task. Our approach significantly outperforms other advanced methods in dehazing and produces dehazed images that are closest to real haze-free images.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cro...</summary><p>A cross-dataset vision alignment and augmentation technology is proposed to boost generalizable feature learning in the de-hazing task</p></details> | None |
| **[Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Real-World Image Dehazing with Unpaired Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15017v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpaired training has been verified as one of the most effective paradigms for real scene dehazing by learning from unpaired real-world hazy and clear images. Although numerous studies have been proposed, current methods demonstrate limited generalization for various real scenes due to limited feature representation and insufficient use of real-world prior. Inspired by the strong generative capabilities of diffusion models in producing both hazy and clear images, we exploit diffusion prior for real-world image dehazing, and propose an unpaired framework named Diff-Dehazer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion prior as bijective mapping learners within the CycleGAN, a classic unpaired learning framework. Considering that physical priors contain pivotal statistics information of real-world data, we further excavate real-world knowledge by integrating physical priors into our framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new perspective for adequately leveraging the representation ability of diffusion models by removing degradation in image and text modalities, so as to improve the dehazing effect. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

| **[DehazeMamba: SAR-guided Optical Remote Sensing Image Dehazing with Adaptive State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13073v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical remote sensing image dehazing presents significant challenges due to its extensive spatial scale and highly non-uniform haze distribution, which traditional single-image dehazing methods struggle to address effectively. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery offers inherently haze-free reference information for large-scale scenes, existing SAR-guided dehazing approaches face two critical limitations: the integration of SAR information often diminishes the quality of haze-free regions, and the instability of feature quality further exacerbates cross-modal domain shift. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DehazeMamba, a novel SAR-guided dehazing network built on a progressive haze decoupling fusion strategy. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a Haze Perception and Decoupling Module (HPDM) that dynamically identifies haze-affected regions through optical-SAR difference analysis, and a Progressive Fusion Module (PFM) that mitigates domain shift through a two-stage fusion process based on feature quality assessment. To facilitate research in this domain, we present MRSHaze, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 8,000 pairs of temporally synchronized, precisely geo-registered SAR-optical images with high resolution and diverse haze conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DehazeMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 0.73 dB improvement in PSNR and substantial enhancements in downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.

| **[Seeing Beyond Haze: Generative Nighttime Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08073v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nighttime image dehazing is particularly challenging when dense haze and intense glow severely degrade or completely obscure background information. Existing methods often encounter difficulties due to insufficient background priors and limited generative ability, both essential for handling such conditions. In this paper, we introduce BeyondHaze, a generative nighttime dehazing method that not only significantly reduces haze and glow effects but also infers background information in regions where it may be absent. Our approach is developed on two main ideas: gaining strong background priors by adapting image diffusion models to the nighttime dehazing problem, and enhancing generative ability for haze- and glow-obscured scene areas through guided training. Task-specific nighttime dehazing knowledge is distilled into an image diffusion model in a manner that preserves its capacity to generate clean images. The diffusion model is additionally trained on image pairs designed to improve its ability to generate background details and content that are missing in the input image due to haze effects. Since generative models are susceptible to hallucinations, we develop our framework to allow user control over the generative level, balancing visual realism and factual accuracy. Experiments on real-world images demonstrate that BeyondHaze effectively restores visibility in dense nighttime haze.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to effectively remove haze from images while preserving crucial image details. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates significant improvements in image quality metrics, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores compared to traditional dehazing methods. Through extensive experimentation on the RESIDE and DenseHaze CVPR 2019 dataset, we show that our approach effectively handles both synthetic and real-world hazy images. CycleGAN handles the unpaired nature of hazy and clean images effectively, enabling the model to learn mappings even without paired data.</p></details> |  | None |

Additionally, their performance is often inadequate under non-uniform or heavy haze. To address these challenges, we developed the Detail Recovery And Contrastive DehazeNet, which facilitates efficient and effective dehazing via a dense dilated inverted residual block and an attention-based detail recovery network that tailors enhancements to specific dehazed scene contexts. A major innovation is its ability to train effectively with limited data, achieved through a novel quadruplet loss-based contrastive dehazing paradigm. This approach distinctly separates hazy and clear image features while also distinguish lower-quality and higher-quality dehazed images obtained from each sub-modules of our network, thereby refining the dehazing process to a larger extent.

While vision Transformers have exhibited impressive results in diverse dehazing tasks, their quadratic complexity and lack of dehazing priors pose significant drawbacks for real-world applications.

PGH$^2$Net is built upon the UNet-like architecture with an efficient encoder and decoder, consisting of two module types: (1) Prior aggregation module that injects B/DCP and selects diverse contexts with gating attention. (2) Feature harmonization modules that subtract low-frequency components from spatial and channel aspects and learn more informative feature distributions to equalize the feature maps.</p></details> |  | None |

Image dehazing is recognized as a challenging and ill-posed vision task that requires complex transformations and interpretations in the feature space. Recent advancements have introduced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) since KANs can leverage their polynomial foundation to more efficiently approximate complex functions while requiring fewer layers than MLPs. Motivated by this potential, this paper explores the use of KANs combined with adversarial training and contrastive learning to model the intricate relationship between hazy and clear images. Adversarial training is employed due to its capacity in producing high-fidelity images, and contrastive learning promotes the model's emphasis on significant features while suppressing the influence of irrelevant information. The proposed UID-KAT framework is trained in an unsupervised setting to take advantage of the abundance of real-world data and address the challenge of preparing paired hazy/clean images. Experimental results show that UID-KAT achieves state-of-the-art dehazing performance across multiple datasets and scenarios, outperforming existing unpaired methods while reducing model complexity.

Existing learning-based BDQA methods have achieved remarkable success, while the small scale of DQA datasets limits their performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to adapt Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP), pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, to the BDQA task. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the human visual system understands images based on hierarchical features, we take global and local information of the dehazed image as the input of CLIP. To accurately map the input hierarchical information of dehazed images into the quality score, we tune both the vision branch and language branch of CLIP with prompt learning. Experimental results on two authentic DQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach, named CLIP-DQA, achieves more accurate quality predictions over existing BDQA methods.

Despite these strides, many existing methods fall short in meeting the efficiency demands of practical applications. In this paper, we introduce WaveDH, a novel and compact ConvNet designed to address this efficiency gap in image dehazing. Our WaveDH leverages wavelet sub-bands for guided up-and-downsampling and frequency-aware feature refinement. The key idea lies in utilizing wavelet decomposition to extract low-and-high frequency components from feature levels, allowing for faster processing while upholding high-quality reconstruction. The downsampling block employs a novel squeeze-and-attention scheme to optimize the feature downsampling process in a structurally compact manner through wavelet domain learning, preserving discriminative features while discarding noise components. In our upsampling block, we introduce a dual-upsample and fusion mechanism to enhance high-frequency component awareness, aiding in the reconstruction of high-frequency details. Departing from conventional dehazing methods that treat low-and-high frequency components equally, our feature refinement block strategically processes features with a frequency-aware approach. By employing a coarse-to-fine methodology, it not only refines the details at frequency levels but also significantly optimizes computational costs. The refinement is performed in a maximum 8x downsampled feature space, striking a favorable efficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, WaveDH, outperforms many state-of-the-art methods on several image dehazing benchmarks with significantly reduced computational costs.

Existing methods rely on a single manual prior, which cannot effectively reveal image details. To overcome this limitation, we propose an unpaired image dehazing network, called the Simple Image Dehaze Enhancer via Unpaired Rich Physical Prior (UR2P-Dehaze). First, to accurately estimate the illumination, reflectance, and color information of the hazy image, we design a shared prior estimator (SPE) that is iteratively trained to ensure the consistency of illumination and reflectance, generating clear, high-quality images. Additionally, a self-monitoring mechanism is introduced to eliminate undesirable features, providing reliable priors for image reconstruction. Next, we propose Dynamic Wavelet Separable Convolution (DWSC), which effectively integrates key features across both low and high frequencies, significantly enhancing the preservation of image details and ensuring global consistency. Finally, to effectively restore the color information of the image, we propose an Adaptive Color Corrector that addresses the problem of unclear colors. The PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID and CIEDE2000 metrics on the benchmark dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. It also contributes to the performance improvement of downstream tasks.

However, they often struggle with real-world hazy images due to domain shift, limiting their practical applicability. This paper introduces HazeCLIP, a language-guided adaptation framework designed to enhance the real-world performance of pre-trained dehazing networks. Inspired by the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model's ability to distinguish between hazy and clean images, we leverage it to evaluate dehazing results. Combined with a region-specific dehazing technique and tailored prompt sets, the CLIP model accurately identifies hazy areas, providing a high-quality, human-like prior that guides the fine-tuning process of pre-trained networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HazeCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-word image dehazing, evaluated through both visual quality and image quality assessment metrics.

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

The idea of inverse problem transform (IPT) has been proposed in recent remote sensing literature in order to reformulate a hardly tractable inverse problem (e.g., HyDHZ) into a relatively simple one. Considering the emerging spectral super-resolution (SSR) technique, which spectrally upsamples multispectral data to hyperspectral data, we aim to solve the challenging HyDHZ problem by reformulating it as an SSR problem. Roughly speaking, the proposed algorithm first automatically selects some uncorrupted/informative spectral bands, from which SSR is applied to spectrally upsample the selected bands in the feature space, thereby obtaining a clean hyperspectral image (HSI). The clean HSI is then further refined by a deep transformer network to obtain the final dehazed HSI, where a global attention mechanism is designed to capture nonlocal information. There are very few HyDHZ works in existing literature, and this article introduces the powerful spatial-spectral transformer into HyDHZ for the first time. Remarkably, the proposed transformer-driven IPT-based HyDHZ (T2HyDHZ) is a blind algorithm without requiring the user to manually select the corrupted region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of T2HyDHZ with less color distortion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS)</p></details> | None |

However, relying solely on the RGB color space often fall short, frequently leaving residual haze. This arises from two main issues: the difficulty in obtaining clear textural features from hazy RGB images and the complexity of acquiring real haze/clean image pairs outside controlled environments like smoke-filled scenes. To address these issues, we first propose a novel Structure Guided Dehazing Network (SGDN) that leverages the superior structural properties of YCbCr features over RGB. It comprises two key modules: Bi-Color Guidance Bridge (BGB) and Color Enhancement Module (CEM). BGB integrates a phase integration module and an interactive attention module, utilizing the rich texture features of the YCbCr space to guide the RGB space, thereby recovering clearer features in both frequency and spatial domains. To maintain tonal consistency, CEM further enhances the color perception of RGB features by aggregating YCbCr channel information. Furthermore, for effective supervised learning, we introduce a Real-World Well-Aligned Haze (RW$^2$AH) dataset, which includes a diverse range of scenes from various geographical regions and climate conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple real-world smoke/haze datasets.

This paper brings the MAE-like framework to nighttime image enhancement, demonstrating that severe augmentation during training produces strong network priors that are resilient to real-world night haze degradations. We propose a novel nighttime image dehazing method with self-prior learning. Our main novelty lies in the design of severe augmentation, which allows our model to learn robust priors. Unlike MAE that uses masking, we leverage two key challenging factors of nighttime images as augmentation: light effects and noise. During training, we intentionally degrade clear images by blending them with light effects as well as by adding noise, and subsequently restore the clear images. This enables our model to learn clear background priors. By increasing the noise values to approach as high as the pixel intensity values of the glow and light effect blended images, our augmentation becomes severe, resulting in stronger priors. While our self-prior learning is considerably effective in suppressing glow and revealing details of background scenes, in some cases, there are still some undesired artifacts that remain, particularly in the forms of over-suppression. To address these artifacts, we propose a self-refinement module based on the semi-supervised teacher-student framework. Our NightHaze, especially our MAE-like self-prior learning, shows that models trained with severe augmentation effectively improve the visibility of input haze images, approaching the clarity of clear nighttime images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our NightHaze achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing nighttime image dehazing methods by a substantial margin of 15.5% for MUSIQ and 23.5% for ClipIQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

This task remains challenging due to the complexities in accurately modeling real haze distributions and the scarcity of paired real-world data. To address these challenges, we first introduce a cooperative unfolding network that jointly models atmospheric scattering and image scenes, effectively integrating physical knowledge into deep networks to restore haze-contaminated details. Additionally, we propose the first RID-oriented iterative mean-teacher framework, termed the Coherence-based Label Generator, to generate high-quality pseudo labels for network training. Specifically, we provide an optimal label pool to store the best pseudo-labels during network training, leveraging both global and local coherence to select high-quality candidates and assign weights to prioritize haze-free regions. We verify the effectiveness of our method, with experiments demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on RID tasks.

Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net. Additionally, DPTE-Net is trained within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, leveraging the strong generalization of GAN in image restoration, and employs a transmission-aware loss function to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DPTE-Net can achieve competitive dehazing performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a promising solution for resource-limited applications.

| **[Towards Context-aware Convolutional Network for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11008v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing task to recover a high-quality image from its corrupted observation. Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Variational Bayesian Modeling of Haze Degradation Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03745v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relying on the representation power of neural networks, most recent works have often neglected several factors involved in haze degradation, such as transmission (the amount of light reaching an observer from a scene over distance) and atmospheric light. These factors are generally unknown, making dehazing problems ill-posed and creating inherent uncertainties. To account for such uncertainties and factors involved in haze degradation, we introduce a variational Bayesian framework for single image dehazing. We propose to take not only a clean image and but also transmission map as latent variables, the posterior distributions of which are parameterized by corresponding neural networks: dehazing and transmission networks, respectively. Based on a physical model for haze degradation, our variational Bayesian framework leads to a new objective function that encourages the cooperation between them, facilitating the joint training of and thereby boosting the performance of each other. In our framework, a dehazing network can estimate a clean image independently of a transmission map estimation during inference, introducing no overhead. Furthermore, our model-agnostic framework can be seamlessly incorporated with other existing dehazing networks, greatly enhancing the performance consistently across datasets and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CIKM 2023, 10 pages, 9 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-Guided Posterior Sampling for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15295v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Polarization Image Dehazing Method Based on the Principle of Physical Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09924v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision is increasingly used in areas such as unmanned vehicles, surveillance systems and remote sensing. However, in foggy scenarios, image degradation leads to loss of target details, which seriously affects the accuracy and effectiveness of these vision tasks. Polarized light, due to the fact that its electromagnetic waves vibrate in a specific direction, is able to resist scattering and refraction effects in complex media more effectively compared to unpolarized light. As a result, polarized light has a greater ability to maintain its polarization characteristics in complex transmission media and under long-distance imaging conditions. This property makes polarized imaging especially suitable for complex scenes such as outdoor and underwater, especially in foggy environments, where higher quality images can be obtained. Based on this advantage, we propose an innovative semi-physical polarization dehazing method that does not rely on an external light source. The method simulates the diffusion process of fog and designs a diffusion kernel that corresponds to the image blurriness caused by this diffusion. By employing spatiotemporal Fourier transforms and deconvolution operations, the method recovers the state of fog droplets prior to diffusion and the light inversion distribution of objects. This approach effectively achieves dehazing and detail enhancement of the scene.</p></details> |  | None |

The emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) exhibits the significant potential for dense haze removal with its strong generation ability. Since remote sensing images contain extensive small-scale texture structures, it is important to effectively restore image details from hazy images. However, current wisdom of DDPM fails to preserve image details and color fidelity well, limiting its dehazing capacity for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Fourier-aware diffusion model for remote sensing image dehazing, termed RSHazeDiff. From a new perspective, RSHazeDiff explores the conditional DDPM to improve image quality in dense hazy scenarios, and it makes three key contributions. First, RSHazeDiff refines the training phase of diffusion process by performing noise estimation and reconstruction constraints in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Thus, it remedies the unpleasing results caused by the simple noise estimation constraint in DDPM. Second, by taking the frequency information as important prior knowledge during iterative sampling steps, RSHazeDiff can preserve more texture details and color fidelity in dehazed images. Third, we design a global compensated learning module to utilize the Fourier transform to capture the global dependency features of input images, which can effectively mitigate the effects of boundary artifacts when processing fixed-size patches. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the favorable performance of RSHazeDiff over state-of-the-art methods.

The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on three UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring, show that our model achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | WACV2025 | None |

However, most of them need very complicated training procedures to achieve satisfactory results. For the first time, we present a novel pipeline called Prompt-based Test-Time Dehazing (PTTD) to help generate visually pleasing results of real-captured hazy images during the inference phase. We experimentally observe that given a dehazing model trained on synthetic data, fine-tuning the statistics (\ie, mean and standard deviation) of encoding features is able to narrow the domain gap, boosting the performance of real image dehazing. Accordingly, we first apply a prompt generation module (PGM) to generate a visual prompt, which is the reference of appropriate statistical perturbations for mean and standard deviation. Then, we employ a feature adaptation module (FAM) into the existing dehazing models for adjusting the original statistics with the guidance of the generated prompt. PTTD is model-agnostic and can be equipped with various state-of-the-art dehazing models trained on synthetic hazy-clean pairs to tackle the real image dehazing task. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our PTTD is effective, achieving superior performance against state-of-the-art dehazing methods in real-world scenarios.

However, in low-visibility environments such as hazy conditions, the performance of traditional object detection algorithms often degrades significantly, failing to meet the demands of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, this paper proposes two innovative deep learning models: YOLO-Vehicle and YOLO-Vehicle-Pro. YOLO-Vehicle is an object detection model tailored specifically for autonomous driving scenarios, employing multimodal fusion techniques to combine image and textual information for object detection. YOLO-Vehicle-Pro builds upon this foundation by introducing an improved image dehazing algorithm, enhancing detection performance in low-visibility environments. In addition to model innovation, this paper also designs and implements a cloud-edge collaborative object detection system, deploying models on edge devices and offloading partial computational tasks to the cloud in complex situations. Experimental results demonstrate that on the KITTI dataset, the YOLO-Vehicle-v1s model achieved 92.1% accuracy while maintaining a detection speed of 226 FPS and an inference time of 12ms, meeting the real-time requirements of autonomous driving. When processing hazy images, the YOLO-Vehicle-Pro model achieved a high accuracy of 82.3% mAP@50 on the Foggy Cityscapes dataset while maintaining a detection speed of 43 FPS.</p></details> |  | None |

Learning-based methods usually require paired hazy and corresponding ground truth (haze-free) images for training. However, it is difficult to collect real-world image pairs, which prevents developments of existing methods. Although several works partially alleviate this issue by using synthetic datasets or small-scale real datasets. The haze intensity distribution bias and scene homogeneity in existing datasets limit the generalization ability of these methods, particularly when encountering images with previously unseen haze intensities. In this work, we present LMHaze, a large-scale, high-quality real-world dataset. LMHaze comprises paired hazy and haze-free images captured in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, spanning multiple scenarios and haze intensities. It contains over 5K high-resolution image pairs, surpassing the size of the biggest existing real-world dehazing dataset by over 25 times. Meanwhile, to better handle images with different haze intensities, we propose a mixture-of-experts model based on Mamba (MoE-Mamba) for dehazing, which dynamically adjusts the model parameters according to the haze intensity. Moreover, with our proposed dataset, we conduct a new large multimodal model (LMM)-based benchmark study to simulate human perception for evaluating dehazed images. Experiments demonstrate that LMHaze dataset improves the dehazing performance in real scenarios and our dehazing method provides better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The lack of real-life hazy ground truth images necessitates synthetic datasets, which often lack diverse haze types, impeding effective haze type classification and dehazing algorithm selection. This research introduces the HazeSpace2M dataset, a collection of over 2 million images designed to enhance dehazing through haze type classification. HazeSpace2M includes diverse scenes with 10 haze intensity levels, featuring Fog, Cloud, and Environmental Haze (EH). Using the dataset, we introduce a technique of haze type classification followed by specialized dehazers to clear hazy images. Unlike conventional methods, our approach classifies haze types before applying type-specific dehazing, improving clarity in real-life hazy images. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, ResNet50 and AlexNet achieve 92.75\% and 92.50\% accuracy, respectively, against existing synthetic datasets. However, these models achieve only 80% and 70% accuracy, respectively, against our Real Hazy Testset (RHT), highlighting the challenging nature of our HazeSpace2M dataset. Additional experiments show that haze type classification followed by specialized dehazing improves results by 2.41% in PSNR, 17.14% in SSIM, and 10.2\% in MSE over general dehazers. Moreover, when testing with SOTA dehazing models, we found that applying our proposed framework significantly improves their performance.

PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components and defects in the aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the visible quality of aerial images is inevitably degraded by adverse weather like haze, rain, or snow, which are found to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to release numerous corresponding datasets, namely, HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for power line aerial image dehazing, RainCPLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for power line aerial image deraining, SnowCPLID, SnowInsPLAD for power line aerial image desnowing, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models. Meanwhile, we select numerous state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the baseline methods for PLAIR-AW. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasets. The proposed datasets and trained models are available at https://github.com/ntuhubin/PLAIR-AW.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ntuhubin/PLAIR-AW) |
| **[Single Image Dehazing Using Scene Depth Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05683v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images captured in hazy weather generally suffer from quality degradation, and many dehazing methods have been developed to solve this problem. However, single image dehazing problem is still challenging due to its ill-posed nature. In this paper, we propose a depth order guided single image dehazing method, which utilizes depth order in hazy images to guide the dehazing process to achieve a similar depth perception in corresponding dehazing results. The consistency of depth perception ensures that the regions that look farther or closer in hazy images also appear farther or closer in the corresponding dehazing results, and thus effectively avoid the undesired visual effects. To achieve this goal, a simple yet effective strategy is proposed to extract the depth order in hazy images, which offers a reference for depth perception in hazy weather. Additionally, a depth order embedded transformation model is devised, which performs transmission estimation under the guidance of depth order to realize an unchanged depth order in the dehazing results. The extracted depth order provides a powerful global constraint for the dehazing process, which contributes to the efficient utilization of global information, thereby bringing an overall improvement in restoration quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can better recover potential structure and vivid color with higher computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art dehazing methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Dual High-Order Total Variation Model for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14868v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing, low-light image enhancement, and some high-level vision tasks.

Previously, many methods based on priors and deep learning have been proposed to address the task of image dehazing. Ignoring the domain gap between different data, former de-hazing methods usually adopt multiple datasets for explicit training, which often makes the methods themselves be violated. To address this problem, we propose a novel method of internal and external data augmentation to improve the existing dehazing methodology. By using cross-data external augmentor. The dataset inherits samples from different domains that are firmly aligned, making the model learn more robust and generalizable features. By using the internal data augmentation method, the model can fully exploit local information within the images, thereby obtaining more image details. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct training on both the Natural Image Dataset (NID) and the Remote Sensing Image Dataset (RSID). Experimental results show that our method clearly resolves the domain gap in different dehazing datasets and presents a new pipeline for joint training in the dehazing task. Our approach significantly outperforms other advanced methods in dehazing and produces dehazed images that are closest to real haze-free images.

Recognizing the limitations of traditional physical model-based methods and the inefficiencies of current attention-based solutions, we propose a new dehazing network combining an innovative Haze-Aware Attention Module (HAAM) with a Multiscale Frequency Enhancement Module (MFEM). The HAAM is inspired by the atmospheric scattering model, thus skillfully integrating physical principles into high-dimensional features for targeted dehazing. It picks up on latent features during the image restoration process, which gives a significant boost to the metrics, while the MFEM efficiently enhances high-frequency details, thus sidestepping wavelet or Fourier transform complexities. It employs multiscale fields to extract and emphasize key frequency components with minimal parameter overhead. Integrated into a simple U-Net framework, our Haze-Aware Attention Network (HAA-Net) for single-image dehazing significantly outperforms existing attention-based and transformer models in efficiency and effectiveness. Tested across various public datasets, the HAA-Net sets new performance benchmarks. Our work not only advances the field of image dehazing but also offers insights into the design of attention mechanisms for broader applications in computer vision.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures | None |

This paper proposes a novel dual-branch collaborative unpaired dehazing model (DCM-dehaze) to address this issue. The proposed method consists of two collaborative branches: dehazing and contour constraints. Specifically, we design a dual depthwise separable convolutional module (DDSCM) to enhance the information expressiveness of deeper features and the correlation to shallow features. In addition, we construct a bidirectional contour function to optimize the edge features of the image to enhance the clarity and fidelity of the image details. Furthermore, we present feature enhancers via a residual dense architecture to eliminate redundant features of the dehazing process and further alleviate the domain deviation problem. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method reaches the state-of-the-art.

| **[Prototype Clustered Diffusion Models for Versatile Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09768v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have made remarkable progress in solving various inverse problems, attributing to the generative modeling capability of the data manifold. Posterior sampling from the conditional score function enable the precious data consistency certified by the measurement-based likelihood term. However, most prevailing approaches confined to the deterministic deterioration process of the measurement model, regardless of capricious unpredictable disturbance in real-world sceneries. To address this obstacle, we show that the measurement-based likelihood can be renovated with restoration-based likelihood via the opposite probabilistic graphic direction, licencing the patronage of various off-the-shelf restoration models and extending the strictly deterministic deterioration process to adaptable clustered processes with the supposed prototype, in what we call restorer guidance. Particularly, assembled with versatile prototypes optionally, we can resolve inverse problems with bunch of choices for assorted sample quality and realize the proficient deterioration control with assured realistic. We show that our work can be formally analogous to the transition from classifier guidance to classifier-free guidance in the field of inverse problem solver. Experiments on multifarious inverse problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, including image dehazing, rain streak removal, and motion deblurring.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Depth Information Assisted Collaborative Mutual Promotion Network for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01105v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering a clear image from a single hazy image is an open inverse problem. Although significant research progress has been made, most existing methods ignore the effect that downstream tasks play in promoting upstream dehazing. From the perspective of the haze generation mechanism, there is a potential relationship between the depth information of the scene and the hazy image. Based on this, we propose a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework to achieve the dehazing of a single image. This framework integrates depth estimation and dehazing by a dual-task interaction mechanism and achieves mutual enhancement of their performance. To realize the joint optimization of the two tasks, an alternative implementation mechanism with the difference perception is developed. On the one hand, the difference perception between the depth maps of the dehazing result and the ideal image is proposed to promote the dehazing network to pay attention to the non-ideal areas of the dehazing. On the other hand, by improving the depth estimation performance in the difficult-to-recover areas of the hazy image, the dehazing network can explicitly use the depth information of the hazy image to assist the clear image recovery. To promote the depth estimation, we propose to use the difference between the dehazed image and the ground truth to guide the depth estimation network to focus on the dehazed unideal areas. It allows dehazing and depth estimation to leverage their strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that of the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | ACCEPT BY CVPR2024 | None |

While various methodologies have evolved from early works predicting transmission matrix and atmospheric light features to deep learning and dehazing networks, they innately prioritize dehazing quality metrics, neglecting the need for real-time applicability in time-sensitive domains like autonomous driving. This work introduces FALCON (Frequency Adjoint Link with CONtinuous density mask), a single-image dehazing system achieving state-of-the-art performance on both quality and speed. Particularly, we develop a novel bottleneck module, namely, Frequency Adjoint Link, operating in the frequency space to globally expand the receptive field with minimal growth in network size. Further, we leverage the underlying haze distribution based on the atmospheric scattering model via a Continuous Density Mask (CDM) which serves as a continuous-valued mask input prior and a differentiable auxiliary loss. Comprehensive experiments involving multiple state-of-the-art methods and ablation analysis demonstrate FALCON's exceptional performance in both dehazing quality and speed (i.e., >$180 frames-per-second), quantified by metrics such as FPS, PSNR, and SSIM.</p></details> |  | None |

UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

Many deep learning methods with powerful representation learning capability demonstrate advanced performance on non-homogeneous dehazing, however, these methods usually struggle with processing high-resolution images (e.g., $4000 \times 6000$) due to their heavy computational demands. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative non-homogeneous Dehazing method via Deformable Convolutional Transformer-like architecture (DehazeDCT). Specifically, we first design a transformer-like network based on deformable convolution v4, which offers long-range dependency and adaptive spatial aggregation capabilities and demonstrates faster convergence and forward speed. Furthermore, we leverage a lightweight Retinex-inspired transformer to achieve color correction and structure refinement.

This substitution aims to better fit the complex and variable distribution of haze. The approach also integrates the atmospheric scattering model and other elementary functions to enhance dehazing performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CL2S achieves outstanding performance on multiple dehazing datasets, particularly in maintaining image details and color authenticity. Additionally, systematic ablation experiments supplementing DM2F validate the concerns raised about DM2F and confirm the necessity and effectiveness of the functional components in the proposed CL2S model.

The emergence of CNNs and Transformers has taken extraordinary strides in the RSID arena. However, these methods often struggle to demonstrate the balance of adequate long-range dependency modeling and maintaining computational efficiency. To this end, we propose the first lightweight network on the mamba-based model called RSDhamba in the field of RSID. Greatly inspired by the recent rise of Selective State Space Model (SSM) for its superior performance in modeling linear complexity and remote dependencies, our designed RSDehamba integrates the SSM framework into the U-Net architecture. Specifically, we propose the Vision Dehamba Block (VDB) as the core component of the overall network, which utilizes the linear complexity of SSM to achieve the capability of global context encoding. Simultaneously, the Direction-aware Scan Module (DSM) is designed to dynamically aggregate feature exchanges over different directional domains to effectively enhance the flexibility of sensing the spatially varying distribution of haze. In this way, our RSDhamba fully demonstrates the superiority of spatial distance capture dependencies and channel information exchange for better extraction of haze features. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks validate the surpassing performance of our RSDehamba against existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional convolutional models struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive field size. While Transformers excel at capturing such dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity in relation to feature map resolution makes them less suitable for pixel-to-pixel dense prediction tasks. Moreover, fixed kernels or tokens in most models do not adapt well to varying blur sizes, resulting in suboptimal dehazing performance. In this study, we introduce a novel dehazing network based on Parallel Stripe Cross Attention (PCSA) with a multi-scale strategy. PCSA efficiently integrates long-range dependencies by simultaneously capturing horizontal and vertical relationships, allowing each pixel to capture contextual cues from an expanded spatial domain. To handle different sizes and shapes of blurs flexibly, We employs a channel-wise design with varying convolutional kernel sizes and strip lengths in each PCSA to capture context information at different scales.Additionally, we incorporate a softmax-based adaptive weighting mechanism within PCSA to prioritize and leverage more critical features.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages , 4 figures, CTISC'24</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes a novel method for UID named Orthogonal Decoupling Contrastive Regularization (ODCR). Our method is grounded in the assumption that an image consists of both haze-related features, which influence the degree of haze, and haze-unrelated features, such as texture and semantic information. ODCR aims to ensure that the haze-related features of the dehazing result closely resemble those of the clear image, while the haze-unrelated features align with the input hazy image. To accomplish the motivation, Orthogonal MLPs optimized geometrically on the Stiefel manifold are proposed, which can project image features into an orthogonal space, thereby reducing the relevance between different features. Furthermore, a task-driven Depth-wise Feature Classifier (DWFC) is proposed, which assigns weights to the orthogonal features based on the contribution of each channel's feature in predicting whether the feature source is hazy or clear in a self-supervised fashion. Finally, a Weighted PatchNCE (WPNCE) loss is introduced to achieve the pulling of haze-related features in the output image toward those of clear images, while bringing haze-unrelated features close to those of the hazy input.

Most current dehazing methods rely on neural networks and face challenges such as high computational parameter pressure and weak generalization capabilities. This paper introduces PriorNet--a novel, lightweight, and highly applicable dehazing network designed to significantly improve the clarity and visual quality of hazy images while avoiding excessive detail extraction issues. The core of PriorNet is the original Multi-Dimensional Interactive Attention (MIA) mechanism, which effectively captures a wide range of haze characteristics, substantially reducing the computational load and generalization difficulties associated with complex systems. By utilizing a uniform convolutional kernel size and incorporating skip connections, we have streamlined the feature extraction process. Simplifying the number of layers and architecture not only enhances dehazing efficiency but also facilitates easier deployment on edge devices. Extensive testing across multiple datasets has demonstrated PriorNet's exceptional performance in dehazing and clarity restoration, maintaining image detail and color fidelity in single-image dehazing tasks. Notably, with a model size of just 18Kb, PriorNet showcases superior dehazing generalization capabilities compared to other methods.

A huge domain gap between synthetic and real-world haze images degrades dehazing performance in practical settings. However, collecting real-world image datasets for training dehazing models is challenging since both hazy and clean pairs must be captured under the same conditions. In this paper, we propose a Physics-guided Parametric Augmentation Network (PANet) that generates photo-realistic hazy and clean training pairs to effectively enhance real-world dehazing performance. PANet comprises a Haze-to-Parameter Mapper (HPM) to project hazy images into a parameter space and a Parameter-to-Haze Mapper (PHM) to map the resampled haze parameters back to hazy images. In the parameter space, we can pixel-wisely resample individual haze parameter maps to generate diverse hazy images with physically-explainable haze conditions unseen in the training set. Our experimental results demonstrate that PANet can augment diverse realistic hazy images to enrich existing hazy image benchmarks so as to effectively boost the performances of state-of-the-art image dehazing models.</p></details> |  | None |

Though previous methods have made marvelous progress, they still suffer from information loss in content and color in dense-haze scenarios. The recently emerged Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) exhibits strong generation ability, showing potential for solving this problem. However, DDPM fails to consider the physics property of dehazing task, limiting its information completion capacity. In this work, we propose DehazeDDPM: A DDPM-based and physics-aware image dehazing framework that applies to complex hazy scenarios. Specifically, DehazeDDPM works in two stages. The former stage physically models the dehazing task with the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM), pulling the distribution closer to the clear data and endowing DehazeDDPM with fog-aware ability. The latter stage exploits the strong generation ability of DDPM to compensate for the haze-induced huge information loss, by working in conjunction with the physical modelling.

Recent research mainly focus on deep learning-based methods with single modality, while they may result in severe information loss especially in dense-haze scenarios. The infrared image exhibits robustness to the haze, however, existing methods have primarily treated the infrared modality as auxiliary information, failing to fully explore its rich information in dehazing. To address this challenge, the key insight of this study is to design a visible-infrared fusion network for image dehazing. In particular, we propose a multi-scale Deep Structure Feature Extraction (DSFE) module, which incorporates the Channel-Pixel Attention Block (CPAB) to restore more spatial and marginal information within the deep structural features. Additionally, we introduce an inconsistency weighted fusion strategy to merge the two modalities by leveraging the more reliable information. To validate this, we construct a visible-infrared multimodal dataset called AirSim-VID based on the AirSim simulation platform. Extensive experiments performed on challenging real and simulated image datasets demonstrate that VIFNet can outperform many state-of-the-art competing methods.

Previous deep learning-based image dehazing methods have failed to achieve satisfactory dehazing effects on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, exhibiting poor generalization. Moreover, single-stage networks often result in many regions with artifacts and color distortion in output images. To address these issues, this paper proposes a two-stage image dehazing network called TSNet, mainly consisting of the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) and the adaptive learning module (ALM). Specifically, MSFM and ALM enhance the generalization of TSNet. The MSFM can obtain large receptive fields at multiple scales and integrate features at different frequencies to reduce the differences between inputs and learning objectives. The ALM can actively learn of regions of interest in images and restore texture details more effectively. Additionally, TSNet is designed as a two-stage network, where the first-stage network performs image dehazing, and the second-stage network is employed to improve issues such as artifacts and color distortion present in the results of the first-stage network. We also change the learning objective from ground truth images to opposite fog maps, which improves the learning efficiency of TSNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSNet exhibits superior dehazing performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[A Semi-supervised Nighttime Dehazing Baseline with Spatial-Frequency Aware and Realistic Brightness Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18548v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing research based on deep learning has extensively explored the problem of daytime image dehazing. However, few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First, there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes, which may cause haze, glow and noise with localized, coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second, due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data, unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues, we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing. First, the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the first issue. Second, a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

| **[SelfPromer: Self-Prompt Dehazing Transformers with Depth-Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07033v3)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an effective depth-consistency self-prompt Transformer for image dehazing. It is motivated by an observation that the estimated depths of an image with haze residuals and its clear counterpart vary. Enforcing the depth consistency of dehazed images with clear ones, therefore, is essential for dehazing. For this purpose, we develop a prompt based on the features of depth differences between the hazy input images and corresponding clear counterparts that can guide dehazing models for better restoration. Specifically, we first apply deep features extracted from the input images to the depth difference features for generating the prompt that contains the haze residual information in the input. Then we propose a prompt embedding module that is designed to perceive the haze residuals, by linearly adding the prompt to the deep features. Further, we develop an effective prompt attention module to pay more attention to haze residuals for better removal. By incorporating the prompt, prompt embedding, and prompt attention into an encoder-decoder network based on VQGAN, we can achieve better perception quality. As the depths of clear images are not available at inference, and the dehazed images with one-time feed-forward execution may still contain a portion of haze residuals, we propose a new continuous self-prompt inference that can iteratively correct the dehazing model towards better haze-free image generation. Extensive experiments show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of perception metrics including NIQE, PI, and PIQE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI24.

| **[Learning to Deblur Polarized Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18134v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A polarization camera can capture four polarized images with different polarizer angles in a single shot, which is useful in polarization-based vision applications since the degree of polarization (DoP) and the angle of polarization (AoP) can be directly computed from the captured polarized images. However, since the on-chip micro-polarizers block part of the light so that the sensor often requires a longer exposure time, the captured polarized images are prone to motion blur caused by camera shakes, leading to noticeable degradation in the computed DoP and AoP. Deblurring methods for conventional images often show degenerated performance when handling the polarized images since they only focus on deblurring without considering the polarization constrains. In this paper, we propose a polarized image deblurring pipeline to solve the problem in a polarization-aware manner by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy to explicitly decompose the problem into two less ill-posed sub-problems, and design a two-stage neural network to handle the two sub-problems respectively. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world images, and can improve the performance of polarization-based vision applications such as image dehazing and reflection removal.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[U-shaped Vision Mamba for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04139v4)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, Transformer is the most popular architecture for image dehazing, but due to its large computational complexity, its ability to handle long-range dependency is limited on resource-constrained devices. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the U-shaped Vision Mamba (UVM-Net), an efficient single-image dehazing network. Inspired by the State Space Sequence Models (SSMs), a new deep sequence model known for its power to handle long sequences, we design a Bi-SSM block that integrates the local feature extraction ability of the convolutional layer with the ability of the SSM to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our method provides a more highly efficient idea of long-range dependency modeling for image dehazing as well as other image restoration tasks.

| **[Fooling the Image Dehazing Models by First Order Gradient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17255v2)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The research on the single image dehazing task has been widely explored. However, as far as we know, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the robustness of the well-trained dehazing models. Therefore, there is no evidence that the dehazing networks can resist malicious attacks. In this paper, we focus on designing a group of attack methods based on first order gradient to verify the robustness of the existing dehazing algorithms. By analyzing the general purpose of image dehazing task, four attack methods are proposed, which are predicted dehazed image attack, hazy layer mask attack, haze-free image attack and haze-preserved attack. The corresponding experiments are conducted on six datasets with different scales. Further, the defense strategy based on adversarial training is adopted for reducing the negative effects caused by malicious attacks. In summary, this paper defines a new challenging problem for the image dehazing area, which can be called as adversarial attack on dehazing networks (AADN).

An existing simple degradation model (similar to atmospheric image "hazing" effects), though helpful, is not sufficient to properly represent the underwater image degradation because there are unaccounted for and non-measurable factors e.g. scattering of light due to turbidity of water, reflective characteristics of turbid medium etc. We propose a deep learning-based architecture to automatically simulate the underwater effects where only a dehazing-like image formation equation is known to the network, and the additional degradation due to the other unknown factors if inferred in a data-driven way. We only use RGB images (because in real-time scenario depth image is not available) to estimate the depth image. For testing, we have proposed (due to the lack of real underwater image datasets) a complex image formation model/equation to manually generate images that resemble real underwater images (used as ground truth). However, only the classical image formation equation (the one used for image dehazing) is informed to the network. This mimics the fact that in a real scenario, the physics are never completely known and only simplified models are known. Thanks to the ground truth, generated by a complex image formation equation, we could successfully perform a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of proposed technique, compared to other purely data driven approaches</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning from History: Task-agnostic Model Contrastive Learning for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06023v5)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has emerged as a prevailing paradigm for high-level vision tasks, which, by introducing properly negative samples, has also been exploited for low-level vision tasks to achieve a compact optimization space to account for their ill-posed nature. However, existing methods rely on manually predefined and task-oriented negatives, which often exhibit pronounced task-specific biases. To address this challenge, our paper introduces an innovative method termed 'learning from history', which dynamically generates negative samples from the target model itself. Our approach, named Model Contrastive Learning for Image Restoration (MCLIR), rejuvenates latency models as negative models, making it compatible with diverse image restoration tasks. We propose the Self-Prior guided Negative loss (SPN) to enable it. This approach significantly enhances existing models when retrained with the proposed model contrastive paradigm. The results show significant improvements in image restoration across various tasks and architectures. For example, models retrained with SPN outperform the original FFANet and DehazeFormer by 3.41 dB and 0.57 dB on the RESIDE indoor dataset for image dehazing. Similarly, they achieve notable improvements of 0.47 dB on SPA-Data over IDT for image deraining and 0.12 dB on Manga109 for a 4x scale super-resolution over lightweight SwinIR, respectively.

| **[Depth-agnostic Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07213v1)** | 2024-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem. Existing datasets for training deep learning-based methods can be generated by hand-crafted or synthetic schemes. However, the former often suffers from small scales, while the latter forces models to learn scene depth instead of haze distribution, decreasing their dehazing ability. To overcome the problem, we propose a simple yet novel synthetic method to decouple the relationship between haze density and scene depth, by which a depth-agnostic dataset (DA-HAZE) is generated. Meanwhile, a Global Shuffle Strategy (GSS) is proposed for generating differently scaled datasets, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the model. Extensive experiments indicate that models trained on DA-HAZE achieve significant improvements on real-world benchmarks, with less discrepancy between SOTS and DA-SOTS (the test set of DA-HAZE). Additionally, Depth-agnostic dehazing is a more complicated task because of the lack of depth prior. Therefore, an efficient architecture with stronger feature modeling ability and fewer computational costs is necessary. We revisit the U-Net-based architectures for dehazing, in which dedicatedly designed blocks are incorporated. However, the performances of blocks are constrained by limited feature fusion methods. To this end, we propose a Convolutional Skip Connection (CSC) module, allowing vanilla feature fusion methods to achieve promising results with minimal costs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art methods. equipped with CSC can achieve better performance and reasonable computational expense, whether the haze distribution is relevant to the scene depth.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Haze Removal via Regional Saturation-Value Translation and Soft Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12054v1)** | 2024-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a single image dehazing prior, called Regional Saturation-Value Translation (RSVT), to tackle the color distortion problems caused by conventional dehazing approaches in bright regions. The RSVT prior is developed based on two key observations regarding the relationship between hazy and haze-free points in the HSV color space. First, the hue component shows marginal variation between corresponding hazy and haze-free points, consolidating a hypothesis that the pixel value variability induced by haze primarily occurs in the saturation and value spaces. Second, in the 2D saturation-value coordinate system, most lines passing through hazy-clean point pairs are likely to intersect near the atmospheric light coordinates. Accordingly, haze removal for the bright regions can be performed by properly translating saturation-value coordinates. In addition, an effective soft segmentation method based on a morphological min-max channel is introduced. By combining the soft segmentation mask with the RSVT prior, a comprehensive single image dehazing framework is devised. Experimental results on various synthetic and realistic hazy image datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully addresses color distortion issues and restores visually appealing images.

| **[Non-aligned supervision for Real Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04940v4)** | 2024-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Removing haze from real-world images is challenging due to unpredictable weather conditions, resulting in the misalignment of hazy and clear image pairs. In this paper, we propose an innovative dehazing framework that operates under non-aligned supervision. This framework is grounded in the atmospheric scattering model, and consists of three interconnected networks: dehazing, airlight, and transmission networks. In particular, we explore a non-alignment scenario that a clear reference image, unaligned with the input hazy image, is utilized to supervise the dehazing network. To implement this, we present a multi-scale reference loss that compares the feature representations between the referred image and the dehazed output. Our scenario makes it easier to collect hazy/clear image pairs in real-world environments, even under conditions of misalignment and shift views. To showcase the effectiveness of our scenario, we have collected a new hazy dataset including 415 image pairs captured by mobile Phone in both rural and urban areas, called "Phone-Hazy". Furthermore, we introduce a self-attention network based on mean and variance for modeling real infinite airlight, using the dark channel prior as positional guidance. Additionally, a channel attention network is employed to estimate the three-channel transmission. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over existing state-of-the-art techniques in the real-world image dehazing task.

| **[DHFormer: A Vision Transformer-Based Attention Module for Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09955v1)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images acquired in hazy conditions have degradations induced in them. Dehazing such images is a vexed and ill-posed problem. Scores of prior-based and learning-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate the effect of haze and generate haze-free images. Many conventional methods are constrained by their lack of awareness regarding scene depth and their incapacity to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, a method that uses residual learning and vision transformers in an attention module is proposed. It essentially comprises two networks: In the first one, the network takes the ratio of a hazy image and the approximated transmission matrix to estimate a residual map. The second network takes this residual image as input and passes it through convolution layers before superposing it on the generated feature maps. It is then passed through global context and depth-aware transformer encoders to obtain channel attention. The attention module then infers the spatial attention map before generating the final haze-free image. Experimental results, including several quantitative metrics, demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the suggested methodology.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we propose RSHazeNet, an encoder-minimal and decoder-minimal framework for efficient remote sensing image dehazing. Specifically, regarding the process of merging features within the same level, we develop an innovative module called intra-level transposed fusion module (ITFM). This module employs adaptive transposed self-attention to capture comprehensive context-aware information, facilitating the robust context-aware feature fusion. Meanwhile, we present a cross-level multi-view interaction module (CMIM) to enable effective interactions between features from various levels, mitigating the loss of information due to the repeated sampling operations. In addition, we propose a multi-view progressive extraction block (MPEB) that partitions the features into four distinct components and employs convolution with varying kernel sizes, groups, and dilation factors to facilitate view-progressive feature learning.

Although very competitive dehazing performance has been achieved with sophisticated models, effective solutions for extracting useful features are still under-explored. In addition, non-local network, which has made a breakthrough in many vision tasks, has not been appropriately applied to image dehazing. Thus, a multi-receptive-field non-local network (MRFNLN) consisting of the multi-stream feature attention block (MSFAB) and cross non-local block (CNLB) is presented in this paper. We start with extracting richer features for dehazing. Specifically, we design a multi-stream feature extraction (MSFE) sub-block, which contains three parallel convolutions with different receptive fields (i.e., $1\times 1$, $3\times 3$, $5\times 5$) for extracting multi-scale features. Following MSFE, we employ an attention sub-block to make the model adaptively focus on important channels/regions. The MSFE and attention sub-blocks constitute our MSFAB. Then, we design a cross non-local block (CNLB), which can capture long-range dependencies beyond the query. Instead of the same input source of query branch, the key and value branches are enhanced by fusing more preceding features. CNLB is computation-friendly by leveraging a spatial pyramid down-sampling (SPDS) strategy to reduce the computation and memory consumption without sacrificing the performance. Last but not least, a novel detail-focused contrastive regularization (DFCR) is presented by emphasizing the low-level details and ignoring the high-level semantic information in the representation space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MRFNLN model outperforms recent state-of-the-art dehazing methods with less than 1.5 Million parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE TCYB for possible publication</p></details> | None |

In recent years, deep learning-based methods have achieved success. However, existing image dehazing methods typically neglect the hierarchy of features in the neural network and fail to exploit their relationships fully. To this end, we propose an effective image dehazing method named Hierarchical Contrastive Dehazing (HCD), which is based on feature fusion and contrastive learning strategies. HCD consists of a hierarchical dehazing network (HDN) and a novel hierarchical contrastive loss (HCL). Specifically, the core design in the HDN is a hierarchical interaction module, which utilizes multi-scale activation to revise the feature responses hierarchically. To cooperate with the training of HDN, we propose HCL which performs contrastive learning on hierarchically paired exemplars, facilitating haze removal. Extensive experiments on public datasets, RESIDE, HazeRD, and DENSE-HAZE, demonstrate that HCD quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM and achieves better visual quality.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Frequency Compensated Diffusion Model for Real-scene Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10510v2)** | 2023-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to distribution shift, deep learning based methods for image dehazing suffer from performance degradation when applied to real-world hazy images. In this paper, we consider a dehazing framework based on conditional diffusion models for improved generalization to real haze. First, we find that optimizing the training objective of diffusion models, i.e., Gaussian noise vectors, is non-trivial. The spectral bias of deep networks hinders the higher frequency modes in Gaussian vectors from being learned and hence impairs the reconstruction of image details. To tackle this issue, we design a network unit, named Frequency Compensation block (FCB), with a bank of filters that jointly emphasize the mid-to-high frequencies of an input signal. We demonstrate that diffusion models with FCB achieve significant gains in both perceptual and distortion metrics. Second, to further boost the generalization performance, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline, HazeAug, to augment haze in terms of degree and diversity. Within the framework, a solid baseline for blind dehazing is set up where models are trained on synthetic hazy-clean pairs, and directly generalize to real data. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed dehazing diffusion model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

However, the quadratic computational complexity of softmax-attention limits the wide application in image dehazing task, especially for high-resolution images. To address this issue, we propose a new Transformer variant, which applies the Taylor expansion to approximate the softmax-attention and achieves linear computational complexity. A multi-scale attention refinement module is proposed as a complement to correct the error of the Taylor expansion. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-branch architecture with multi-scale patch embedding to the proposed Transformer, which embeds features by overlapping deformable convolution of different scales. The design of multi-scale patch embedding is based on three key ideas: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field. Our model, named Multi-branch Transformer expanded by Taylor formula (MB-TaylorFormer), can embed coarse to fine features more flexibly at the patch embedding stage and capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost. Experimental results on several dehazing benchmarks show that MB-TaylorFormer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a light computational burden.

Despite the remarkable progress, existing methods still suffer from the following shortcomings: (1) limited exploration of frequency domain information; (2) insufficient information interaction; (3) severe feature redundancy. To remedy these issues, we propose a novel Mutual Information-driven Triple interaction Network (MITNet) based on spatial-frequency dual domain information and two-stage architecture. To be specific, the first stage, named amplitude-guided haze removal, aims to recover the amplitude spectrum of the hazy images for haze removal. And the second stage, named phase-guided structure refined, devotes to learning the transformation and refinement of the phase spectrum. To facilitate the information exchange between two stages, an Adaptive Triple Interaction Module (ATIM) is developed to simultaneously aggregate cross-domain, cross-scale, and cross-stage features, where the fused features are further used to generate content-adaptive dynamic filters so that applying them to enhance global context representation. In addition, we impose the mutual information minimization constraint on paired scale encoder and decoder features from both stages. Such an operation can effectively reduce information redundancy and enhance cross-stage feature complementarity.

However, most previous studies mainly focus on daytime image dehazing or partial degradations presented in nighttime hazy scenes, which may lead to unsatisfactory restoration results. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based framework for nighttime haze removal, called NightHazeFormer. Our proposed approach consists of two stages: supervised pre-training and semi-supervised fine-tuning. During the pre-training stage, we introduce two powerful priors into the transformer decoder to generate the non-learnable prior queries, which guide the model to extract specific degradations. For the fine-tuning, we combine the generated pseudo ground truths with input real-world nighttime hazy images as paired images and feed into the synthetic domain to fine-tune the pre-trained model. This semi-supervised fine-tuning paradigm helps improve the generalization to real domain. In addition, we also propose a large-scale synthetic dataset called UNREAL-NH, to simulate the real-world nighttime haze scenarios comprehensively. Extensive experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our NightHazeFormer over state-of-the-art nighttime haze removal methods in terms of both visually and quantitatively.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures | None |

The visual enhancement for low-light hazy images is an ill-posed problem. Even though numerous methods have been proposed for image dehazing and low-light enhancement respectively, simply integrating them cannot deliver pleasing results for this particular task. In this paper, we present a novel method to enhance visibility for low-light hazy scenarios. To handle this challenging task, we propose two key techniques, namely cross-consistency dehazing-enhancement framework and physically based simulation for low-light hazy dataset. Specifically, the framework is designed for enhancing visibility of the input image via fully utilizing the clues from different sub-tasks. The simulation is designed for generating the dataset with ground-truths by the proposed low-light hazy imaging model. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the SOTA solutions on different metrics including SSIM (9.19%) and PSNR(5.03%).

| **[DFR-Net: Density Feature Refinement Network for Image Dehazing Utilizing Haze Density Difference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13927v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image dehazing task, haze density is a key feature and affects the performance of dehazing methods. However, some of the existing methods lack a comparative image to measure densities, and others create intermediate results but lack the exploitation of their density differences, which can facilitate perception of density. To address these deficiencies, we propose a density-aware dehazing method named Density Feature Refinement Network (DFR-Net) that extracts haze density features from density differences and leverages density differences to refine density features. In DFR-Net, we first generate a proposal image that has lower overall density than the hazy input, bringing in global density differences. Additionally, the dehazing residual of the proposal image reflects the level of dehazing performance and provides local density differences that indicate localized hard dehazing or high density areas. Subsequently, we introduce a Global Branch (GB) and a Local Branch (LB) to achieve density-awareness. In GB, we use Siamese networks for feature extraction of hazy inputs and proposal images, and we propose a Global Density Feature Refinement (GDFR) module that can refine features by pushing features with different global densities further away. In LB, we explore local density features from the dehazing residuals between hazy inputs and proposal images and introduce an Intermediate Dehazing Residual Feedforward (IDRF) module to update local features and pull them closer to clear image features. Sufficient experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results beyond the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, unified models that can handle different degradations have been proposed and yield promising results. However, these approaches focus on synthetic images and experience a significant performance drop when applied to realworld images. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Removal, a twostage semi-supervised framework for addressing the removal of multiple degradations in real-world images using a unified model and parameters. In the knowledge transfer stage, Uni-Removal leverages a supervised multi-teacher and student architecture in the knowledge transfer stage to facilitate learning from pretrained teacher networks specialized in different degradation types. A multi-grained contrastive loss is introduced to enhance learning from feature and image spaces. In the domain adaptation stage, unsupervised fine-tuning is performed by incorporating an adversarial discriminator on real-world images. The integration of an extended multi-grained contrastive loss and generative adversarial loss enables the adaptation of the student network from synthetic to real-world domains. Extensive experiments on real-world degraded datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We compare our Uni-Removal framework with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods, showcasing its promising results in real-world image dehazing, deraining, and deblurring simultaneously.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Let Segment Anything Help Image Dehaze](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15870v1)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large language model and high-level vision model have achieved impressive performance improvements with large datasets and model sizes. However, low-level computer vision tasks, such as image dehaze and blur removal, still rely on a small number of datasets and small-sized models, which generally leads to overfitting and local optima. Therefore, we propose a framework to integrate large-model prior into low-level computer vision tasks. Just as with the task of image segmentation, the degradation of haze is also texture-related. So we propose to detect gray-scale coding, network channel expansion, and pre-dehaze structures to integrate large-model prior knowledge into any low-level dehazing network. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of large models in guiding low-level visual tasks through different datasets and algorithms comparison experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of grayscale coding, network channel expansion, and recurrent network structures through ablation experiments. Under the conditions where additional data and training resources are not required, we successfully prove that the integration of large-model prior knowledge will improve the dehaze performance and save training time for low-level visual tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Image enhancement algorithms can be used to reduce dust. However, these require dusty and dust-free images of the same environment for validation. In fact, to date, there is no dataset that we are aware of that addresses this issue. Therefore, we present the agriscapes RB-Dust dataset, which is named after its purpose of reference-based dust removal. It is not possible to take pictures from the cabin during tillage, as this would cause shifts in the images. Because of this, we built a setup from which it is possible to take images from a stationary position close to the passing tractor. The test setup was based on a half-sided gate through which the tractor could drive. The field tests were carried out on a farm in Bavaria, Germany, during tillage. During the field tests, other parameters such as soil moisture and wind speed were controlled, as these significantly affect dust development. We validated our dataset with contrast enhancement and image dehazing algorithms and analyzed the generalizability from recordings from the moving tractor. Finally, we demonstrate the application of dust removal based on a high-level vision task, such as person classification. Our empirical study confirms the validity of RB-Dust for vision-based dust removal in agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR Workshop NTIRE 2023.

In our industrial deployment scenario based on remote sensing (RS) images, the quality of image dehazing directly affects the grade of our crop identification and growth monitoring products. However, the widely used peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) provide ambiguous visual interpretation. In this paper, we design a new objective metric for RS image dehazing evaluation. Our proposed metric leverages a ground-based phenology observation resource to calculate the vegetation index error between RS and ground images at a hazy date. Extensive experiments validate that our metric appropriately evaluates different dehazing models and is in line with human visual perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2023 Industry Track</p></details> | None |
| **[Illumination Controllable Dehazing Network based on Unsupervised Retinex Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05675v1)** | 2023-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On the one hand, the dehazing task is an illposedness problem, which means that no unique solution exists. On the other hand, the dehazing task should take into account the subjective factor, which is to give the user selectable dehazed images rather than a single result. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-output dehazing network by introducing illumination controllable ability, called IC-Dehazing. The proposed IC-Dehazing can change the illumination intensity by adjusting the factor of the illumination controllable module, which is realized based on the interpretable Retinex theory. Moreover, the backbone dehazing network of IC-Dehazing consists of a Transformer with double decoders for high-quality image restoration. Further, the prior-based loss function and unsupervised training strategy enable IC-Dehazing to complete the parameter learning process without the need for paired data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IC-Dehazing, quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on image dehazing, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks.

| **[Progressive Update Guided Interdependent Networks for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01701v4)** | 2023-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images with haze of different varieties often pose a significant challenge to dehazing. Therefore, guidance by estimates of haze parameters related to the variety would be beneficial, and their progressive update jointly with haze reduction will allow effective dehazing. To this end, we propose a multi-network dehazing framework containing novel interdependent dehazing and haze parameter updater networks that operate in a progressive manner. The haze parameters, transmission map and atmospheric light, are first estimated using dedicated convolutional networks that allow color-cast handling. The estimated parameters are then used to guide our dehazing module, where the estimates are progressively updated by novel convolutional networks. The updating takes place jointly with progressive dehazing using a network that invokes inter-step dependencies. The joint progressive updating and dehazing gradually modify the haze parameter values toward achieving effective dehazing. Through different studies, our dehazing framework is shown to be more effective than image-to-image mapping and predefined haze formation model based dehazing. The framework is also found capable of handling a wide variety of hazy conditions wtih different types and amounts of haze and color casts. Our dehazing framework is qualitatively and quantitatively found to outperform the state-of-the-art on synthetic and real-world hazy images of multiple datasets with varied haze conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

| **[Curricular Contrastive Regularization for Physics-aware Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14218v2)** | 2023-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Considering the ill-posed nature, contrastive regularization has been developed for single image dehazing, introducing the information from negative images as a lower bound. However, the contrastive samples are nonconsensual, as the negatives are usually represented distantly from the clear (i.e., positive) image, leaving the solution space still under-constricted. Moreover, the interpretability of deep dehazing models is underexplored towards the physics of the hazing process. In this paper, we propose a novel curricular contrastive regularization targeted at a consensual contrastive space as opposed to a non-consensual one. Our negatives, which provide better lower-bound constraints, can be assembled from 1) the hazy image, and 2) corresponding restorations by other existing methods. Further, due to the different similarities between the embeddings of the clear image and negatives, the learning difficulty of the multiple components is intrinsically imbalanced. To tackle this issue, we customize a curriculum learning strategy to reweight the importance of different negatives. In addition, to improve the interpretability in the feature space, we build a physics-aware dual-branch unit according to the atmospheric scattering model. With the unit, as well as curricular contrastive regularization, we establish our dehazing network, named C2PNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our C2PNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extreme PSNR boosts of 3.94dB and 1.50dB, respectively, on SOTS-indoor and SOTS-outdoor datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR2023</p></details> | None |
| **[MixDehazeNet : Mix Structure Block For Image Dehazing Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17654v1)** | 2023-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing is a typical task in the low-level vision field. Previous studies verified the effectiveness of the large convolutional kernel and attention mechanism in dehazing. However, there are two drawbacks: the multi-scale properties of an image are readily ignored when a large convolutional kernel is introduced, and the standard series connection of an attention module does not sufficiently consider an uneven hazy distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mix Structure Image Dehazing Network (MixDehazeNet), which solves two issues mentioned above. Specifically, it mainly consists of two parts: the multi-scale parallel large convolution kernel module and the enhanced parallel attention module. Compared with a single large kernel, parallel large kernels with multi-scale are more capable of taking partial texture into account during the dehazing phase. In addition, an enhanced parallel attention module is developed, in which parallel connections of attention perform better at dehazing uneven hazy distribution. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. For example, compared with the previous state-of-the-art methods, MixDehazeNet achieves a significant improvement (42.62dB PSNR) on the SOTS indoor dataset.

Most prior methods consider fully supervised training and learn from paired clean and hazy images, where a hazy image is synthesized based on a clean image and its estimated depth map. This paradigm, however, can produce low-quality hazy images due to inaccurate depth estimation, resulting in poor generalization of the trained models. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach for generating paired clean-hazy images by leveraging computer graphics. Using a modern game engine, our approach renders crisp clean images and their precise depth maps, based on which high-quality hazy images can be synthesized for training dehazing models. To this end, we present SimHaze: a new synthetic haze dataset. More importantly, we show that training with SimHaze alone allows the latest dehazing models to achieve significantly better performance in comparison to previous dehazing datasets.

In this paper we present a novel model for ultra high-resolution image restoration, referred to as the Global-Local Stepwise Generative Network (GLSGN), which employs a stepwise restoring strategy involving four restoring pathways: three local pathways and one global pathway. The local pathways focus on conducting image restoration in a fine-grained manner over local but high-resolution image patches, while the global pathway performs image restoration coarsely on the scale-down but intact image to provide cues for the local pathways in a global view including semantics and noise patterns. To smooth the mutual collaboration between these four pathways, our GLSGN is designed to ensure the inter-pathway consistency in four aspects in terms of low-level content, perceptual attention, restoring intensity and high-level semantics, respectively. As another major contribution of this work, we also introduce the first ultra high-resolution dataset to date for both reflection removal and rain streak removal, comprising 4,670 real-world and synthetic images. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image background restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain streak removal and image dehazing, show that our GLSGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[Streamlined Global and Local Features Combinator (SGLC) for High Resolution Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13375v1)** | 2023-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Dehazing aims to remove atmospheric fog or haze from an image. Although the Dehazing models have evolved a lot in recent years, few have precisely tackled the problem of High-Resolution hazy images. For this kind of image, the model needs to work on a downscaled version of the image or on cropped patches from it. In both cases, the accuracy will drop. This is primarily due to the inherent failure to combine global and local features when the image size increases. The Dehazing model requires global features to understand the general scene peculiarities and the local features to work better with fine and pixel details. In this study, we propose the Streamlined Global and Local Features Combinator (SGLC) to solve these issues and to optimize the application of any Dehazing model to High-Resolution images. The SGLC contains two successive blocks. The first is the Global Features Generator (GFG) which generates the first version of the Dehazed image containing strong global features. The second block is the Local Features Enhancer (LFE) which improves the local feature details inside the previously generated image. When tested on the Uformer architecture for Dehazing, SGLC increased the PSNR metric by a significant margin. Any other model can be incorporated inside the SGLC process to improve its efficiency on High-Resolution input data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2023 Workshops</p></details> | None |
| **[Dehazing-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from Hazy Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11448v1)** | 2023-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has received much attention in recent years due to the impressively high quality in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, image degradation caused by the scattering of atmospheric light and object light by particles in the atmosphere can significantly decrease the reconstruction quality when shooting scenes in hazy conditions. To address this issue, we propose Dehazing-NeRF, a method that can recover clear NeRF from hazy image inputs. Our method simulates the physical imaging process of hazy images using an atmospheric scattering model, and jointly learns the atmospheric scattering model and a clean NeRF model for both image dehazing and novel view synthesis. Different from previous approaches, Dehazing-NeRF is an unsupervised method with only hazy images as the input, and also does not rely on hand-designed dehazing priors. By jointly combining the depth estimated from the NeRF 3D scene with the atmospheric scattering model, our proposed model breaks through the ill-posed problem of single-image dehazing while maintaining geometric consistency. Besides, to alleviate the degradation of image quality caused by information loss, soft margin consistency regularization, as well as atmospheric consistency and contrast discriminative loss, are addressed during the model training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the simple combination of single-image dehazing and NeRF on both image dehazing and novel view image synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Data-Centric Solution to NonHomogeneous Dehazing via Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07874v2)** | 2023-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in image dehazing. Many deep learning methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge, and have made significant accomplishments dealing with homogeneous haze. However, these solutions cannot maintain comparable performance when they are applied to images with non-homogeneous haze, e.g., NH-HAZE23 dataset introduced by NTIRE challenges. One of the reasons for such failures is that non-homogeneous haze does not obey one of the assumptions that is required for modeling homogeneous haze. In addition, a large number of pairs of non-homogeneous hazy image and the clean counterpart is required using traditional end-to-end training approaches, while NH-HAZE23 dataset is of limited quantities. Although it is possible to augment the NH-HAZE23 dataset by leveraging other non-homogeneous dehazing datasets, we observe that it is necessary to design a proper data-preprocessing approach that reduces the distribution gaps between the target dataset and the augmented one. This finding indeed aligns with the essence of data-centric AI. With a novel network architecture and a principled data-preprocessing approach that systematically enhances data quality, we present an innovative dehazing method. Specifically, we apply RGB-channel-wise transformations on the augmented datasets, and incorporate the state-of-the-art transformers as the backbone in the two-branch framework. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPRW 2023</p></details> | None |

Existing homogeneous dehazing methods struggle to handle the non-uniform distribution of haze in a robust manner. The crucial challenge of non-homogeneous dehazing is to effectively extract the non-uniform distribution features and reconstruct the details of hazy areas with high quality. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced semi-curricular attention network, called SCANet, for non-homogeneous image dehazing that focuses on enhancing haze-occluded regions. Our approach consists of an attention generator network and a scene reconstruction network. We use the luminance differences of images to restrict the attention map and introduce a self-paced semi-curricular learning strategy to reduce learning ambiguity in the early stages of training. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our SCANet outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we present a new paradigm for real image dehazing from the perspectives of synthesizing more realistic hazy data and introducing more robust priors into the network. Specifically, (1) instead of adopting the de facto physical scattering model, we rethink the degradation of real hazy images and propose a phenomenological pipeline considering diverse degradation types. (2) We propose a Real Image Dehazing network via high-quality Codebook Priors (RIDCP). Firstly, a VQGAN is pre-trained on a large-scale high-quality dataset to obtain the discrete codebook, encapsulating high-quality priors (HQPs). After replacing the negative effects brought by haze with HQPs, the decoder equipped with a novel normalized feature alignment module can effectively utilize high-quality features and produce clean results. However, although our degradation pipeline drastically mitigates the domain gap between synthetic and real data, it is still intractable to avoid it, which challenges HQPs matching in the wild. Thus, we re-calculate the distance when matching the features to the HQPs by a controllable matching operation, which facilitates finding better counterparts. We provide a recommendation to control the matching based on an explainable solution. Users can also flexibly adjust the enhancement degree as per their preference. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our data synthesis pipeline and the superior performance of RIDCP in real image dehazing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Acceptted by CVPR 2023</p></details> | None |

The absence of large-scale 4K benchmark datasets hampers progress in this area, especially for dehazing. The challenges in building ultra-high-definition (UHD) dehazing datasets are the absence of estimation methods for UHD depth maps, high-quality 4K depth estimation datasets, and migration strategies for UHD haze images from synthetic to real domains. To address these problems, we develop a novel synthetic method to simulate 4K hazy images (including nighttime and daytime scenes) from clear images, which first estimates the scene depth, simulates the light rays and object reflectance, then migrates the synthetic images to real domains by using a GAN, and finally yields the hazy effects on 4K resolution images. We wrap these synthesized images into a benchmark called the 4K-HAZE dataset. Specifically, we design the CS-Mixer (an MLP-based model that integrates \textbf{C}hannel domain and \textbf{S}patial domain) to estimate the depth map of 4K clear images, the GU-Net to migrate a 4K synthetic image to the real hazy domain. The most appealing aspect of our approach (depth estimation and domain migration) is the capability to run a 4K image on a single GPU with 24G RAM in real-time (33fps). Additionally, this work presents an objective assessment of several state-of-the-art single-image dehazing methods that are evaluated using the 4K-HAZE dataset. At the end of the paper, we discuss the limitations of the 4K-HAZE dataset and its social implications.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method is based on two core designs. First, we propose Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM) to consistently operate on each pixel via an image-adaptive color mapping matrix, avoiding artifacts and supporting high-resolution inputs with a small memory footprint. Second, we develop a two-stage pipeline by dividing the task into color normalization and stylization, which allows efficient style switching by extracting color styles as presets and reusing them on normalized input images. Due to the unavailability of pairwise datasets, we describe how to train Neural Preset via a self-supervised strategy. Various advantages of Neural Preset over existing methods are demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations. Notably, Neural Preset enables stable 4K color style transfer in real-time without artifacts. Besides, we show that our trained model can naturally support multiple applications without fine-tuning, including low-light image enhancement, underwater image correction, image dehazing, and image harmonization.

We analyze the defects of the original dehazing model, and propose a new and reliable dehazing reconstruction and dehazing model based on the combination of optical scattering model and computer graphics lighting rendering model. Based on the new haze model and the images obtained by the cameras, we can reconstruct the three-dimensional space, accurately calculate the objects and haze in the space, and use the transparency relationship of haze to perform accurate haze removal. To obtain a 3D simulation dataset we used the Unreal 5 computer graphics rendering engine. In order to obtain real shot data in different scenes, we used fog generators, array cameras, mobile phones, underwater cameras and drones to obtain haze data. We use formula derivation, simulation data set and real shot data set result experimental results to prove the feasibility of the new method.

Although deep neural networks have achieved promising results on image segmentation tasks, they are prone to be overconfident for smoke segmentation due to its non-rigid shape and transparent appearance. This is caused by both knowledge level uncertainty due to limited training data for accurate smoke segmentation and labeling level uncertainty representing the difficulty in labeling ground-truth. To effectively model the two types of uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian generative model to simultaneously estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters and its predictions. Further, smoke images suffer from low contrast and ambiguity, inspired by physics-based image dehazing methods, we design a transmission-guided local coherence loss to guide the network to learn pair-wise relationships based on pixel distance and the transmission feature. To promote the development of this field, we also contribute a high-quality smoke segmentation dataset, SMOKE5K, consisting of 1,400 real and 4,000 synthetic images with pixel-wise annotation. Experimental results on benchmark testing datasets illustrate that our model achieves both accurate predictions and reliable uncertainty maps representing model ignorance about its prediction.

Some existing deep learning based methods are devoted to improving the model performance via increasing the depth or width of convolution. The learning ability of convolutional neural network (CNN) structure is still under-explored. In this paper, a detail-enhanced attention block (DEAB) consisting of the detail-enhanced convolution (DEConv) and the content-guided attention (CGA) is proposed to boost the feature learning for improving the dehazing performance. Specifically, the DEConv integrates prior information into normal convolution layer to enhance the representation and generalization capacity. Then by using the re-parameterization technique, DEConv is equivalently converted into a vanilla convolution with NO extra parameters and computational cost. By assigning unique spatial importance map (SIM) to every channel, CGA can attend more useful information encoded in features. In addition, a CGA-based mixup fusion scheme is presented to effectively fuse the features and aid the gradient flow. By combining above mentioned components, we propose our detail-enhanced attention network (DEA-Net) for recovering high-quality haze-free images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEA-Net, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by boosting the PSNR index over 41 dB with only 3.653 M parameters.

A reliable real-time dehazing method with reliable performance is highly desired for many applications such as autonomous driving, security surveillance, etc. While recent learning-based methods require datasets containing pairs of hazy images and clean ground truth, it is impossible to capture them in real scenes. Many existing works compromise this difficulty to generate hazy images by rendering the haze from depth on common RGBD datasets using the haze imaging model. However, there is still a gap between the synthetic datasets and real hazy images as large datasets with high-quality depth are mostly indoor and depth maps for outdoor are imprecise. In this paper, we complement the existing datasets with a new, large, and diverse dehazing dataset containing real outdoor scenes from High-Definition (HD) 3D movies. We select a large number of high-quality frames of real outdoor scenes and render haze on them using depth from stereo. Our dataset is clearly more realistic and more diversified with better visual quality than existing ones. More importantly, we demonstrate that using this dataset greatly improves the dehazing performance on real scenes. In addition to the dataset, we also evaluate a series state of the art methods on the proposed benchmarking datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dehazed Image Quality Evaluation: From Partial Discrepancy to Blind Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12636v1)** | 2022-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing aims to restore spatial details from hazy images. There have emerged a number of image dehazing algorithms, designed to increase the visibility of those hazy images. However, much less work has been focused on evaluating the visual quality of dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a Reduced-Reference dehazed image quality evaluation approach based on Partial Discrepancy (RRPD) and then extend it to a No-Reference quality assessment metric with Blind Perception (NRBP). Specifically, inspired by the hierarchical characteristics of the human perceiving dehazed images, we introduce three groups of features: luminance discrimination, color appearance, and overall naturalness. In the proposed RRPD, the combined distance between a set of sender and receiver features is adopted to quantify the perceptually dehazed image quality. By integrating global and local channels from dehazed images, the RRPD is converted to NRBP which does not rely on any information from the references. Extensive experiment results on several dehazed image quality databases demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference quality assessment models. Furthermore, we show that the proposed dehazed image quality evaluation methods can be effectively applied to tune parameters for potential image dehazing algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Non-Homogeneous Haze Removal via Artificial Scene Prior and Bidimensional Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01888v2)** | 2022-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of natural scene and haze prior information, it is greatly challenging to completely remove the haze from a single image without distorting its visual content. Fortunately, the real-world haze usually presents non-homogeneous distribution, which provides us with many valuable clues in partial well-preserved regions. In this paper, we propose a Non-Homogeneous Haze Removal Network (NHRN) via artificial scene prior and bidimensional graph reasoning. Firstly, we employ the gamma correction iteratively to simulate artificial multiple shots under different exposure conditions, whose haze degrees are different and enrich the underlying scene prior. Secondly, beyond utilizing the local neighboring relationship, we build a bidimensional graph reasoning module to conduct non-local filtering in the spatial and channel dimensions of feature maps, which models their long-range dependency and propagates the natural scene prior between the well-preserved nodes and the nodes contaminated by haze. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration to remove non-homogeneous haze via the graph reasoning based framework. We evaluate our method on different benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over many state-of-the-art algorithms for both the single image dehazing and hazy image understanding tasks. The source code of the proposed NHRN is available on https://github.com/whrws/NHRNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/whrws/NHRNet) |
| **[Towards Generalization on Real Domain for Single Image Dehazing via Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07147v1)** | 2022-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based image dehazing methods are essential to assist autonomous systems in enhancing reliability. Due to the domain gap between synthetic and real domains, the internal information learned from synthesized images is usually sub-optimal in real domains, leading to severe performance drop of dehaizing models. Driven by the ability on exploring internal information from a few unseen-domain samples, meta-learning is commonly adopted to address this issue via test-time training, which is hyperparameter-sensitive and time-consuming. In contrast, we present a domain generalization framework based on meta-learning to dig out representative and discriminative internal properties of real hazy domains without test-time training. To obtain representative domain-specific information, we attach two entities termed adaptation network and distance-aware aggregator to our dehazing network. The adaptation network assists in distilling domain-relevant information from a few hazy samples and caching it into a collection of features. The distance-aware aggregator strives to summarize the generated features and filter out misleading information for more representative internal properties. To enhance the discrimination of distilled internal information, we present a novel loss function called domain-relevant contrastive regularization, which encourages the internal features generated from the same domain more similar and that from diverse domains more distinct. The generated representative and discriminative features are regarded as some external variables of our dehazing network to regress a particular and powerful function for a given domain. The extensive experiments on real hazy datasets, such as RTTS and URHI, validate that our proposed method has superior generalization ability than the state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  | None |

Most cutting-edge models are trained in synthetic data, leading to the poor performance on real-world hazy scenarios. Besides, they commonly give deterministic dehazed images while neglecting to mine their uncertainty. To bridge the domain gap and enhance the dehazing performance, we propose a novel semi-supervised uncertainty-aware transformer network, called Semi-UFormer. Semi-UFormer can well leverage both the real-world hazy images and their uncertainty guidance information. Specifically, Semi-UFormer builds itself on the knowledge distillation framework. Such teacher-student networks effectively absorb real-world haze information for quality dehazing. Furthermore, an uncertainty estimation block is introduced into the model to estimate the pixel uncertainty representations, which is then used as a guidance signal to help the student network produce haze-free images more accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semi-UFormer generalizes well from synthetic to real-world images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing haze removal methods cannot restore the scene with clear blue sky, since the color and texture information of the object in the original haze image is insufficient. To remedy this, we propose a cycle generative adversarial network to construct a novel end-to-end image dehaze model. We adopt outdoor image datasets to train our model, which includes a set of real-world unpaired image dataset and a set of paired image dataset to ensure that the generated images are close to the real scene. Based on the cycle structure, our model adds four different kinds of loss function to constrain the effect including adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, photorealism loss and paired L1 loss. These four constraints can improve the overall quality of such degraded images for better visual appeal and ensure reconstruction of images to keep from distortion. The proposed model could remove the haze of images and also restore the sky of images to be clean and blue (like captured in a sunny weather).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Fourier Up-Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05171v1)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing convolutional neural networks widely adopt spatial down-/up-sampling for multi-scale modeling. However, spatial up-sampling operators (\emph{e.g.}, interpolation, transposed convolution, and un-pooling) heavily depend on local pixel attention, incapably exploring the global dependency. In contrast, the Fourier domain obeys the nature of global modeling according to the spectral convolution theorem. Unlike the spatial domain that performs up-sampling with the property of local similarity, up-sampling in the Fourier domain is more challenging as it does not follow such a local property. In this study, we propose a theoretically sound Deep Fourier Up-Sampling (FourierUp) to solve these issues. We revisit the relationships between spatial and Fourier domains and reveal the transform rules on the features of different resolutions in the Fourier domain, which provide key insights for FourierUp's designs. FourierUp as a generic operator consists of three key components: 2D discrete Fourier transform, Fourier dimension increase rules, and 2D inverse Fourier transform, which can be directly integrated with existing networks. Extensive experiments across multiple computer vision tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, image de-raining, image dehazing, and guided image super-resolution, demonstrate the consistent performance gains obtained by introducing our FourierUp.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by NeurIPS 2022.

Single image dehazing is a typical example, which aims to obtain the haze-free image of a haze one. This paper concentrates on the challenging task of single image dehazing. Based on the atmospheric scattering model, a novel model is designed to directly generate the haze-free image. The main challenge of image dehazing is that the atmospheric scattering model has two parameters, i.e., transmission map and atmospheric light. When they are estimated respectively, the errors will be accumulated to compromise the dehazing quality. Considering this reason and various image sizes, a novel input-size flexibility conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is proposed for single image dehazing, which is input-size flexibility at both training and test stages for image-to-image translation with cGAN framework. A simple and effective U-connection residual network (UR-Net) is proposed to combine the generator and adopt the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) to design the discriminator. Moreover, the model is trained with multi-loss function, in which the consistency loss is a novel designed loss in this paper. Finally, a multi-scale cGAN fusion model is built to realize state-of-the-art single image dehazing performance. The proposed models receive a haze image as input and directly output a haze-free one.

However, how to efficiently leverage such architectures remains an open problem. In this work, we present Dual-former whose critical insight is to combine the powerful global modeling ability of self-attention modules and the local modeling ability of convolutions in an overall architecture. With convolution-based Local Feature Extraction modules equipped in the encoder and the decoder, we only adopt a novel Hybrid Transformer Block in the latent layer to model the long-distance dependence in spatial dimensions and handle the uneven distribution between channels. Such a design eliminates the substantial computational complexity in previous image restoration transformers and achieves superior performance on multiple image restoration tasks. Experiments demonstrate that Dual-former achieves a 1.91dB gain over the state-of-the-art MAXIM method on the Indoor dataset for single image dehazing while consuming only 4.2% GFLOPs as MAXIM. For single image deraining, it exceeds the SOTA method by 0.1dB PSNR on the average results of five datasets with only 21.5% GFLOPs. Dual-former also substantially surpasses the latest desnowing method on various datasets, with fewer parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

Although these networks' pipelines work fine, the key mechanism to improving image dehazing performance remains unclear. For this reason, we do not target to propose a dehazing network with fancy modules; rather, we make minimal modifications to popular U-Net to obtain a compact dehazing network. Specifically, we swap out the convolutional blocks in U-Net for residual blocks with the gating mechanism, fuse the feature maps of main paths and skip connections using the selective kernel, and call the resulting U-Net variant gUNet. As a result, with a significantly reduced overhead, gUNet is superior to state-of-the-art methods on multiple image dehazing datasets. Finally, we verify these key designs to the performance gain of image dehazing networks through extensive ablation studies.</p></details> |  | None |

Data-driven ones restore haze-free images with high PSNR and SSIM values for synthetic hazy images but with low contrast, and even some remaining haze for real world hazy images. In this paper, a novel single image dehazing algorithm is introduced by combining model-based and data-driven approaches. Both transmission map and atmospheric light are first estimated by the model-based methods, and then refined by dual-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs) based approaches. The resultant algorithm forms a neural augmentation which converges very fast while the corresponding data-driven approach might not converge.

The previous methods are devoted to improving the network's performance by increasing the network's depth and width. The current methods focus on increasing the convolutional kernel size to enhance its performance by benefiting from the larger receptive field. However, directly increasing the size of the convolutional kernel introduces a massive amount of computational overhead and parameters. Thus, a novel Large Kernel Convolution Dehaze Block (LKD Block) consisting of the Decomposition deep-wise Large Kernel Convolution Block (DLKCB) and the Channel Enhanced Feed-forward Network (CEFN) is devised in this paper. The designed DLKCB can split the deep-wise large kernel convolution into a smaller depth-wise convolution and a depth-wise dilated convolution without introducing massive parameters and computational overhead. Meanwhile, the designed CEFN incorporates a channel attention mechanism into Feed-forward Network to exploit significant channels and enhance robustness. By combining multiple LKD Blocks and Up-Down sampling modules, the Large Kernel Convolution Dehaze Network (LKD-Net) is conducted. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed DLKCB and CEFN, and our LKD-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art. On the SOTS indoor dataset, our LKD-Net dramatically outperforms the Transformer-based method Dehamer with only 1.79% #Param and 48.9% FLOPs.

In this paper, we raise an intriguing question - if the combination of image restoration and object detection, can boost the performance of cutting-edge detectors in adverse weather conditions. To answer it, we propose an effective yet unified detection paradigm that bridges these two subtasks together via dynamic enhancement learning to discern objects in adverse weather conditions, called TogetherNet. Different from existing efforts that intuitively apply image dehazing/deraining as a pre-processing step, TogetherNet considers a multi-task joint learning problem. Following the joint learning scheme, clean features produced by the restoration network can be shared to learn better object detection in the detection network, thus helping TogetherNet enhance the detection capacity in adverse weather conditions. Besides the joint learning architecture, we design a new Dynamic Transformer Feature Enhancement module to improve the feature extraction and representation capabilities of TogetherNet. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our TogetherNet outperforms the state-of-the-art detection approaches by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Although certain Domain Adaptation (DA) dehazing methods have been presented, they inevitably require access to the source dataset to reduce the gap between the source synthetic and target real domains. To address these issues, we present a novel Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) image dehazing paradigm, in which only a well-trained source model and an unlabeled target real hazy dataset are available. Specifically, we devise the Domain Representation Normalization (DRN) module to make the representation of real hazy domain features match that of the synthetic domain to bridge the gaps. With our plug-and-play DRN module, unlabeled real hazy images can adapt existing well-trained source networks. Besides, the unsupervised losses are applied to guide the learning of the DRN module, which consists of frequency losses and physical prior losses. Frequency losses provide structure and style constraints, while the prior loss explores the inherent statistic property of haze-free images. Equipped with our DRN module and unsupervised loss, existing source dehazing models are able to dehaze unlabeled real hazy images. Extensive experiments on multiple baselines demonstrate the validity and superiority of our method visually and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2022</p></details> | None |

Several works have been focused on transferring advances from image classification, detection, and segmentation to the niche of image dehazing, primarily focusing on contrastive learning and knowledge distillation. However, these approaches prove computationally expensive, raising concern regarding their applicability to on-the-edge use-cases. This work introduces a simple, lightweight, and efficient framework for single-image haze removal, exploiting rich "dark-knowledge" information from a lightweight pre-trained super-resolution model via the notion of heterogeneous knowledge distillation. We designed a feature affinity module to maximize the flow of rich feature semantics from the super-resolution teacher to the student dehazing network. In order to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed framework, its performance as a plug-and-play setup to a baseline model is examined. Our experiments are carried out on the RESIDE-Standard dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our framework to the synthetic and real-world domains.

This paper provides a new perspective to treat image dehazing as a two-class separated factor disentanglement task, i.e, the task-relevant factor of clear image reconstruction and the task-irrelevant factor of haze-relevant distribution. To achieve the disentanglement of these two-class factors in deep feature space, contrastive learning is introduced into a CycleGAN framework to learn disentangled representations by guiding the generated images to be associated with latent factors. With such formulation, the proposed contrastive disentangled dehazing method (CDD-GAN) employs negative generators to cooperate with the encoder network to update alternately, so as to produce a queue of challenging negative adversaries. Then these negative adversaries are trained end-to-end together with the backbone representation network to enhance the discriminative information and promote factor disentanglement performance by maximizing the adversarial contrastive loss. During the training, we further show that hard negative examples can suppress the task-irrelevant factors and unpaired clear exemples can enhance the task-relevant factors, in order to better facilitate haze removal and help image restoration. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against existing unpaired dehazing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by the haze formation process on Earth, we formulate a similar visual degradation process on clean images and synthesize dusty images sharing a similar feature distribution with realistic dusty images. These realistic clean and synthetic dusty image pairs are used to train a deep model that inherently encodes dust irrelevant features and decodes them into dust-free images. Qualitative and quantitative results show that dust storms can be effectively eliminated by the proposed approach, leading to obviously improved topographical and geomorphological details of Mars.</p></details> |  | None |

Most of the dehazing methods try to estimate the transmission map along with the atmospheric light to get the dehazed image in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture that directly estimates dehazed image in Krawtchouk transform domain. For this a customized Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (KCL) in the architecture is added. KCL is constructed using Krawtchouk basis functions which converts the image from the spatial domain to the Krawtchouk transform domain. Another convolution layer is added at the end of the architecture named as Inverse Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (IKCL) which converts the image back to the spatial domain from the transform domain. It has been observed that the haze is mainly present in lower frequencies of hazy images, wherein the Krawtchouk transform helps to analyze the high and low frequencies of the images separately. We have divided our architecture into two branches, the upper branch deals with the higher frequencies while the lower branch deals with the lower frequencies of the image. The lower branch is made deeper in terms of the layers as compared to the upper branch to address the haze present in the lower frequencies. Using the proposed Orthogonal Transform based Generative Adversarial Network (OTGAN) architecture for image dehazing, we were able to achieve competitive results when compared to the present state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures | None |

From a different yet new perspective, this paper explores contrastive learning with an adversarial training effort to leverage unpaired real-world hazy and clean images, thus bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world haze is avoided. We propose an effective unsupervised contrastive learning paradigm for image dehazing, dubbed UCL-Dehaze. Unpaired real-world clean and hazy images are easily captured, and will serve as the important positive and negative samples respectively when training our UCL-Dehaze network. To train the network more effectively, we formulate a new self-contrastive perceptual loss function, which encourages the restored images to approach the positive samples and keep away from the negative samples in the embedding space. Besides the overall network architecture of UCL-Dehaze, adversarial training is utilized to align the distributions between the positive samples and the dehazed images. Compared with recent image dehazing works, UCL-Dehaze does not require paired data during training and utilizes unpaired positive/negative data to better enhance the dehazing performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our UCL-Dehaze and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-arts, even only 1,800 unpaired real-world images are used to train our network.

Although the current recovery algorithms targeting a specific condition have made impressive progress, it is not flexible enough to deal with various degradation types. We propose an efficient and compact image restoration network named DAN-Net (Degradation-Adaptive Neural Network) to address this problem, which consists of multiple compact expert networks with one adaptive gated neural. A single expert network efficiently addresses specific degradation in nasty winter scenes relying on the compact architecture and three novel components. Based on the Mixture of Experts strategy, DAN-Net captures degradation information from each input image to adaptively modulate the outputs of task-specific expert networks to remove various adverse winter weather conditions. Specifically, it adopts a lightweight Adaptive Gated Neural Network to estimate gated attention maps of the input image, while different task-specific experts with the same topology are jointly dispatched to process the degraded image. Such novel image restoration pipeline handles different types of severe weather scenes effectively and efficiently. It also enjoys the benefit of coordinate boosting in which the whole network outperforms each expert trained without coordination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented manner outperforms the state-of-the-art single-task methods on image quality and has better inference efficiency. Furthermore, we have collected the first real-world winter scenes dataset to evaluate winter image restoration methods, which contains various hazy and snowy images snapped in winter.

In this paper, we make an early effort to consider dehazing robustness under variational haze density, which is a realistic while under-studied problem in the research filed of singe image dehazing. To properly address this problem, we propose a novel density-variational learning framework to improve the robustness of the image dehzing model assisted by a variety of negative hazy images, to better deal with various complex hazy scenarios. Specifically, the dehazing network is optimized under the consistency-regularized framework with the proposed Contrast-Assisted Reconstruction Loss (CARL). The CARL can fully exploit the negative information to facilitate the traditional positive-orient dehazing objective function, by squeezing the dehazed image to its clean target from different directions. Meanwhile, the consistency regularization keeps consistent outputs given multi-level hazy images, thus improving the model robustness. Extensive experimental results on two synthetic and three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Near-Infrared Depth-Independent Image Dehazing using Haar Wavelets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14085v1)** | 2022-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a fusion algorithm for haze removal that combines color information from an RGB image and edge information extracted from its corresponding NIR image using Haar wavelets. The proposed algorithm is based on the key observation that NIR edge features are more prominent in the hazy regions of the image than the RGB edge features in those same regions. To combine the color and edge information, we introduce a haze-weight map which proportionately distributes the color and edge information during the fusion process. Because NIR images are, intrinsically, nearly haze-free, our work makes no assumptions like existing works that rely on a scattering model and essentially designing a depth-independent method. This helps in minimizing artifacts and gives a more realistic sense to the restored haze-free image. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm is both qualitatively and quantitatively better on several key metrics when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2020)</p></details> | None |

However, most of existing dehazing networks are concentrated on training models using simulated hazy images, resulting in generalization performance degradation when applied on real-world hazy images because of domain shift. In this paper, we propose a mutual learning dehazing framework for domain adaption. Specifically, we first devise two siamese networks: a teacher network in the synthetic domain and a student network in the real domain, and then optimize them in a mutual learning manner by leveraging EMA and joint loss. Moreover, we design a sample-cycle strategy based on density augmentation (HDA) module to introduce pseudo real-world image pairs provided by the student network into training for further improving the generalization performance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world dataset demonstrate that the propose mutual learning framework outperforms state-of-the-art dehazing techniques in terms of subjective and objective evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods are often subject to performance degradation when domain shifts are confronted. Specifically, haze density gaps exist among the existing datasets, often resulting in poor performance when these methods are tested across datasets. To address this issue, we propose a density-aware mixup augmentation (DAMix). DAMix generates samples in an attempt to minimize the Wasserstein distance with the hazy images in the target domain. These DAMix-ed samples not only mitigate domain gaps but are also proven to comply with the atmospheric scattering model. Thus, DAMix achieves comprehensive improvements on domain adaptation. Furthermore, we show that DAMix is helpful with respect to data efficiency. Specifically, a network trained with half of the source dataset using DAMix can achieve even better adaptivity than that trained with the whole source dataset but without DAMix.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the problem, we introduce the principle of infinite approximation of Taylor's theorem with the Laplace pyramid pattern to build a model which is capable of handling 4K hazy images in real-time. The N branch networks of the pyramid network correspond to the N constraint terms in Taylor's theorem. Low-order polynomials reconstruct the low-frequency information of the image (e.g. color, illumination). High-order polynomials regress the high-frequency information of the image (e.g. texture). In addition, we propose a Tucker reconstruction-based regularization term that acts on each branch network of the pyramid model. It further constrains the generation of anomalous signals in the feature space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can not only run 4K images with haze in real-time on a single GPU (80FPS) but also has unparalleled interpretability. The developed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two benchmarks (O/I-HAZE) and our updated 4KID dataset while providing the reliable groundwork for subsequent optimization schemes.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed EDN-GTM takes conventional RGB hazy image in conjunction with its transmission map estimated by adopting dark channel prior as the inputs of the network. The proposed EDN-GTM utilizes U-Net for image segmentation as the core network and utilizes various modifications including spatial pyramid pooling module and Swish activation to achieve state-of-the-art dehazing performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed EDN-GTM outperforms most of traditional and deep learning-based image dehazing schemes in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. The proposed EDN-GTM furthermore proves its applicability to object detection problems.

In this paper, firstly, we propose a new complementary feature enhanced framework, in which the complementary features are learned by several complementary subtasks and then together serve to boost the performance of the primary task. One of the prominent advantages of the new framework is that the purposively chosen complementary tasks can focus on learning weakly dependent complementary features, avoiding repetitive and ineffective learning of the networks. We design a new dehazing network based on such a framework. Specifically, we select the intrinsic image decomposition as the complementary tasks, where the reflectance and shading prediction subtasks are used to extract the color-wise and texture-wise complementary features. To effectively aggregate these complementary features, we propose a complementary features selection module (CFSM) to select the more useful features for image dehazing. Furthermore, we introduce a new version of vision transformer block, named Hybrid Local-Global Vision Transformer (HyLoG-ViT), and incorporate it within our dehazing networks. The HyLoG-ViT block consists of the local and the global vision transformer paths used to capture local and global dependencies. As a result, the HyLoG-ViT introduces locality in the networks and captures the global and long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on homogeneous, non-homogeneous, and nighttime dehazing tasks reveal that the proposed dehazing network can achieve comparable or even better performance than CNNs-based dehazing models.</p></details> | 12 pages,10 figures | None |

The proposed dehazing method does not rely on the Atmosphere Scattering Model (ASM), and an explanation as to why it is not necessarily performing the dimension reduction offered by this model is provided. GridDehazeNet+ consists of three modules: pre-processing, backbone, and post-processing. The trainable pre-processing module can generate learned inputs with better diversity and more pertinent features as compared to those derived inputs produced by hand-selected pre-processing methods. The backbone module implements multi-scale estimation with two major enhancements: 1) a novel grid structure that effectively alleviates the bottleneck issue via dense connections across different scales; 2) a spatial-channel attention block that can facilitate adaptive fusion by consolidating dehazing-relevant features. The post-processing module helps to reduce the artifacts in the final output. Due to domain shift, the model trained on synthetic data may not generalize well on real data. To address this issue, we shape the distribution of synthetic data to match that of real data, and use the resulting translated data to finetune our network. We also propose a novel intra-task knowledge transfer mechanism that can memorize and take advantage of synthetic domain knowledge to assist the learning process on the translated data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on several synthetic dehazing datasets, and achieves the superior performance on real-world hazy images after finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1908.03245</p></details> | None |
| **[Perceiving and Modeling Density is All You Need for Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09733v1)** | 2021-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, the degradation of images taken under haze can be quite complex, where the spatial distribution of haze is varied from image to image. Recent methods adopt deep neural networks to recover clean scenes from hazy images directly. However, due to the paradox caused by the variation of real captured haze and the fixed degradation parameters of the current networks, the generalization ability of recent dehazing methods on real-world hazy images is not ideal.To address the problem of modeling real-world haze degradation, we propose to solve this problem by perceiving and modeling density for uneven haze distribution. We propose a novel Separable Hybrid Attention (SHA) module to encode haze density by capturing features in the orthogonal directions to achieve this goal. Moreover, a density map is proposed to model the uneven distribution of the haze explicitly. The density map generates positional encoding in a semi-supervised way. Such a haze density perceiving and modeling capture the unevenly distributed degeneration at the feature level effectively. Through a suitable combination of SHA and density map, we design a novel dehazing network architecture, which achieves a good complexity-performance trade-off. The extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses all state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, boosting the best published PSNR metric from 28.53 dB to 33.49 dB on the Haze4k test dataset and from 37.17 dB to 38.41 dB on the SOTS indoor test dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

An end-to-end system is proposed in this paper to reduce defects by combining the prior knowledge and deep learning method. The haze image is decomposed into the base layer and detail layers through a weighted guided image filter (WGIF) firstly, and the airlight is estimated from the base layer. Then, the base layer image is passed to the efficient deep convolutional network for estimating the transmission map. To restore object close to the camera completely without amplifying noise in sky or heavily hazy scene, an adaptive strategy is proposed based on the value of the transmission map. If the transmission map of a pixel is small, the base layer of the haze image is used to recover a haze-free image via atmospheric scattering model, finally. Otherwise, the haze image is used. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves superior performance over existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Scale Single Image Dehazing Using Laplacian and Gaussian Pyramids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05700v2)** | 2021-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model driven single image dehazing was widely studied on top of different priors due to its extensive applications. Ambiguity between object radiance and haze and noise amplification in sky regions are two inherent problems of model driven single image dehazing. In this paper, a dark direct attenuation prior (DDAP) is proposed to address the former problem. A novel haze line averaging is proposed to reduce the morphological artifacts caused by the DDAP which enables a weighted guided image filter with a smaller radius to further reduce the morphological artifacts while preserve the fine structure in the image. A multi-scale dehazing algorithm is then proposed to address the latter problem by adopting Laplacian and Guassian pyramids to decompose the hazy image into different levels and applying different haze removal and noise reduction approaches to restore the scene radiance at different levels of the pyramid. The resultant pyramid is collapsed to restore a haze-free image. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art dehazing algorithms and the noise is indeed prevented from being amplified in the sky region.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D modelling of survey scene from images enhanced with a multi-exposure fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05541v1)** | 2021-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In current practice, scene survey is carried out by workers using total stations. The method has high accuracy, but it incurs high costs if continuous monitoring is needed. Techniques based on photogrammetry, with the relatively cheaper digital cameras, have gained wide applications in many fields. Besides point measurement, photogrammetry can also create a three-dimensional (3D) model of the scene. Accurate 3D model reconstruction depends on high quality images. Degraded images will result in large errors in the reconstructed 3D model. In this paper, we propose a method that can be used to improve the visibility of the images, and eventually reduce the errors of the 3D scene model. The idea is inspired by image dehazing. Each original image is first transformed into multiple exposure images by means of gamma-correction operations and adaptive histogram equalization. The transformed images are analyzed by the computation of the local binary patterns. The image is then enhanced, with each pixel generated from the set of transformed image pixels weighted by a function of the local pattern feature and image saturation. Performance evaluation has been performed on benchmark image dehazing datasets. Experimentations have been carried out on outdoor and indoor surveys. Our analysis finds that the method works on different types of degradation that exist in both outdoor and indoor images. When fed into the photogrammetry software, the enhanced images can reconstruct 3D scene models with sub-millimeter mean errors.</p></details> |  | None |

GANs combine two neural networks that compete against one another using zero-sum game theory, allowing them to create much crisper and discrete outputs. GANs can be used to perform image processing, video generation and prediction, among other computer vision applications. GANs can also be utilised for a variety of science-related activities, including protein engineering, astronomical data processing, remote sensing image dehazing, and crystal structure synthesis. Other notable fields where GANs have made gains include finance, marketing, fashion design, sports, and music. Therefore in this article we provide a comprehensive overview of the applications of GANs in a wide variety of disciplines. We first cover the theory supporting GAN, GAN variants, and the metrics to evaluate GANs. Then we present how GAN and its variants can be applied in twelve domains, ranging from STEM fields, such as astronomy and biology, to business fields, such as marketing and finance, and to arts, such as music. As a result, researchers from other fields may grasp how GANs work and apply them to their own study.

| **[Single Image Dehazing with An Independent Detail-Recovery Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10492v1)** | 2021-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single image dehazing is a prerequisite which affects the performance of many computer vision tasks and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing dehazing methods emphasize more on haze removal but less on the detail recovery of the dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a single image dehazing method with an independent Detail Recovery Network (DRN), which considers capturing the details from the input image over a separate network and then integrates them into a coarse dehazed image. The overall network consists of two independent networks, named DRN and the dehazing network respectively. Specifically, the DRN aims to recover the dehazed image details through local and global branches respectively. The local branch can obtain local detail information through the convolution layer and the global branch can capture more global information by the Smooth Dilated Convolution (SDC). The detail feature map is fused into the coarse dehazed image to obtain the dehazed image with rich image details. Besides, we integrate the DRN, the physical-model-based dehazing network and the reconstruction loss into an end-to-end joint learning framework. Extensive experiments on the public image dehazing datasets (RESIDE-Indoor, RESIDE-Outdoor and the TrainA-TestA) illustrate the effectiveness of the modules in the proposed method and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art dehazing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

The contribution of this paper mainly has the following three aspects: 1) A novel Multi-branch Attention (MA) block. The spatial attention mechanism better reconstructs high-frequency features, and the channel attention mechanism treats the features of different channels differently. Multi-branch structure dramatically improves the representation ability of the model and can be changed into a single path structure after re-parameterization to speed up the process of inference. Local Residual Connection allows the low-frequency information in the nonhomogeneous area to pass through the block without processing so that the block can focus on detailed features. 2) A lightweight network structure. We use cascaded MA blocks to extract high-frequency features step by step, and the Multi-layer attention fusion tail combines the shallow and deep features of the model to get the residual of the clean image finally. 3)We propose two novel loss functions to help reconstruct the hazy image ColorAttenuation loss and Laplace Pyramid loss. ERRA-Net has an impressive speed, processing 1200x1600 HD quality images with an average runtime of 166.11 fps. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ERSANet performs favorably against the SOTA approaches on the real-world hazy images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fully Non-Homogeneous Atmospheric Scattering Modeling with Convolutional Neural Networks for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11292v1)** | 2021-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, single image dehazing models (SIDM) based on atmospheric scattering model (ASM) have achieved remarkable results. However, it is noted that ASM-based SIDM degrades its performance in dehazing real world hazy images due to the limited modelling ability of ASM where the atmospheric light factor (ALF) and the angular scattering coefficient (ASC) are assumed as constants for one image. Obviously, the hazy images taken in real world cannot always satisfy this assumption. Such generating modelling mismatch between the real-world images and ASM sets up the upper bound of trained ASM-based SIDM for dehazing. Bearing this in mind, in this study, a new fully non-homogeneous atmospheric scattering model (FNH-ASM) is proposed for well modeling the hazy images under complex conditions where ALF and ASC are pixel dependent. However, FNH-ASM brings difficulty in practical application. In FNH-ASM based SIDM, the estimation bias of parameters at different positions lead to different distortion of dehazing result. Hence, in order to reduce the influence of parameter estimation bias on dehazing results, two new cost sensitive loss functions, beta-Loss and D-Loss, are innovatively developed for limiting the parameter bias of sensitive positions that have a greater impact on the dehazing result. In the end, based on FNH-ASM, an end-to-end CNN-based dehazing network, FNHD-Net, is developed, which applies beta-Loss and D-Loss. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed FNHD-Net for dehazing on both synthetic and real-world images. And the performance improvement of our method increases more obviously in dense and heterogeneous haze scenes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |

To address this issue, we propose a novel image dehazing framework collaborating with unlabeled real data. First, we develop a disentangled image dehazing network (DID-Net), which disentangles the feature representations into three component maps, i.e. the latent haze-free image, the transmission map, and the global atmospheric light estimate, respecting the physical model of a haze process. Our DID-Net predicts the three component maps by progressively integrating features across scales, and refines each map by passing an independent refinement network. Then a disentangled-consistency mean-teacher network (DMT-Net) is employed to collaborate unlabeled real data for boosting single image dehazing. Specifically, we encourage the coarse predictions and refinements of each disentangled component to be consistent between the student and teacher networks by using a consistency loss on unlabeled real data. We make comparison with 13 state-of-the-art dehazing methods on a new collected dataset (Haze4K) and two widely-used dehazing datasets (i.e., SOTS and HazeRD), as well as on real-world hazy images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has obvious quantitative and qualitative improvements over the existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, ACMMM 2021</p></details> | None |

To generate plausible haze, we study two less-touched but challenging problems in hazy image rendering, namely, i) how to estimate the transmission map from a single image without auxiliary information, and ii) how to adaptively learn the airlight from exemplars, i.e., unpaired real hazy images. To this end, we propose a neural rendering method for image hazing, dubbed as HazeGEN. To be specific, HazeGEN is a knowledge-driven neural network which estimates the transmission map by leveraging a new prior, i.e., there exists the structure similarity (e.g., contour and luminance) between the transmission map and the input clean image. To adaptively learn the airlight, we build a neural module based on another new prior, i.e., the rendered hazy image and the exemplar are similar in the airlight distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first attempt to deeply rendering hazy images in an unsupervised fashion. Comparing with existing haze generation methods, HazeGEN renders the hazy images in an unsupervised, learnable, and controllable manner, thus avoiding the labor-intensive efforts in paired data collection and the domain-shift issue in haze generation. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our method comparing with some baselines in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.

In this paper, we address the problem of image dehazing by proposing a dehazing network named T-Net, which consists of a backbone network based on the U-Net architecture and a dual attention module. And it can achieve multi-scale feature fusion by using skip connections with a new fusion strategy. Furthermore, by repeatedly unfolding the plain T-Net, Stack T-Net is proposed to take advantage of the dependence of deep features across stages via a recursive strategy. In order to reduce network parameters, the intra-stage recursive computation of ResNet is adopted in our Stack T-Net. And we take both the stage-wise result and the original hazy image as input to each T-Net and finally output the prediction of clean image. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that our plain T-Net and the advanced Stack T-Net perform favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms, and show that our Stack T-Net could further improve the dehazing effect, demonstrating the effectiveness of the recursive strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

In this case, we obtain the final transmission map by fusing transmission maps at each level to recover a high-quality haze-free image. Experiments on RESIDE SOTS show that PF-DCP not only outperforms the traditional prior-based methods with a large margin but also achieves comparable or even better results of state-of-art deep learning approaches.

| **[Contrastive Learning for Compact Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09367v1)** | 2021-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem due to the severe information degeneration. However, existing deep learning based dehazing methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of dehazing network while negative information is unexploited. Moreover, most of them focus on strengthening the dehazing network with an increase of depth and width, leading to a significant requirement of computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit both the information of hazy images and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, considering trade-off between performance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehazing network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which can benefit from preserving information flow adaptively and expanding the receptive field to improve the network's transformation capability, respectively. We term our dehazing network with autoencoder and contrastive regularization as AECR-Net.

In the field of image dehazing, certain previous works have paid attention to the inter-domain gap between the synthetic domain and the real domain. However, those methods only establish the connection from the source domain to the target domain without taking into account the large distribution shift within the target domain (intra-domain gap). In this work, we propose a Two-Step Dehazing Network (TSDN) with an intra-domain adaptation and a constrained inter-domain adaptation. First, we subdivide the distributions within the synthetic domain into subsets and mine the optimal subset (easy samples) by loss-based supervision. To alleviate the intra-domain gap of the synthetic domain, we propose an intra-domain adaptation to align distributions of other subsets to the optimal subset by adversarial learning. Finally, we conduct the constrained inter-domain adaptation from the real domain to the optimal subset of the synthetic domain, alleviating the domain shift between domains as well as the distribution shift within the real domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms both on the synthetic datasets and the real datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |

Many deep learning based methods have shown their superb performance in handling homogeneous dehazing problems. However, we observe that even if a carefully designed convolutional neural network (CNN) can perform well on large-scaled dehazing benchmarks, the network usually fails on the non-homogeneous dehazing datasets introduced by NTIRE challenges. The reasons are mainly in two folds. Firstly, due to its non-homogeneous nature, the non-uniformly distributed haze is harder to be removed than the homogeneous haze. Secondly, the research challenge only provides limited data (there are only 25 training pairs in NH-Haze 2021 dataset). Thus, learning the mapping from the domain of hazy images to that of clear ones based on very limited data is extremely hard. To this end, we propose a simple but effective approach for non-homogeneous dehazing via ensemble learning. To be specific, we introduce a two-branch neural network to separately deal with the aforementioned problems and then map their distinct features by a learnable fusion tail.

These tasks are typically formulated and tackled individually due to the diverse and complicated appearance patterns of noise layers within the image. In this work we present the Deep-Masking Generative Network (DMGN), which is a unified framework for background restoration from the superimposed images and is able to cope with different types of noise. Our proposed DMGN follows a coarse-to-fine generative process: a coarse background image and a noise image are first generated in parallel, then the noise image is further leveraged to refine the background image to achieve a higher-quality background image. In particular, we design the novel Residual Deep-Masking Cell as the core operating unit for our DMGN to enhance the effective information and suppress the negative information during image generation via learning a gating mask to control the information flow. By iteratively employing this Residual Deep-Masking Cell, our proposed DMGN is able to generate both high-quality background image and noisy image progressively. Furthermore, we propose a two-pronged strategy to effectively leverage the generated noise image as contrasting cues to facilitate the refinement of the background image. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image background restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain steak removal and image dehazing, show that our DMGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each single task.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> | None |

In this paper, for the first time, we show that with a well designed deep learning model, the hidden content may be largely recovered without opening the envelope. We start by modeling deep learning-based privacy attacks on physical mail content as learning the mapping from the camera-captured envelope front face image to the hidden content, then we explicitly model the mapping as a combination of perspective transformation, image dehazing and denoising using a deep convolutional neural network, named Neural-STE (See-Through-Envelope). We show experimentally that hidden content details, such as texture and image structure, can be clearly recovered. Finally, our formulation and model allow us to design envelopes that can counter deep learning-based privacy attacks on physical mail.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/Neural-STE</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/Neural-STE) |

Most existing learning-based dehazing methods are not fully end-to-end, which still follow the traditional dehazing procedure: first estimate the medium transmission and the atmospheric light, then recover the haze-free image based on the atmospheric scattering model. However, in practice, due to lack of priors and constraints, it is hard to precisely estimate these intermediate parameters. Inaccurate estimation further degrades the performance of dehazing, resulting in artifacts, color distortion and insufficient haze removal. To address this, we propose a fully end-to-end Generative Adversarial Networks with Fusion-discriminator (FD-GAN) for image dehazing. With the proposed Fusion-discriminator which takes frequency information as additional priors, our model can generator more natural and realistic dehazed images with less color distortion and fewer artifacts. Moreover, we synthesize a large-scale training dataset including various indoor and outdoor hazy images to boost the performance and we reveal that for learning-based dehazing methods, the performance is strictly influenced by the training data. Experiments have shown that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance on both public synthetic datasets and real-world images with more visually pleasing dehazed results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI2020 (with supplementary files)</p></details> | None |
| **[Progressive residual learning for single image dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07973v1)** | 2021-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent physical model-free dehazing methods have achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, without the guidance of physical models, the performances degrade rapidly when applied to real scenarios due to the unavailable or insufficient data problems. On the other hand, the physical model-based methods have better interpretability but suffer from multi-objective optimizations of parameters, which may lead to sub-optimal dehazing results. In this paper, a progressive residual learning strategy has been proposed to combine the physical model-free dehazing process with reformulated scattering model-based dehazing operations, which enjoys the merits of dehazing methods in both categories. Specifically, the global atmosphere light and transmission maps are interactively optimized with the aid of accurate residual information and preliminary dehazed restorations from the initial physical model-free dehazing process. The proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on public dehazing benchmarks with better model interpretability and adaptivity for complex hazy data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, as these techniques destroy spatial relationship with neighboring regions, performance can be deteriorated when using them to train algorithms designed for low level vision tasks (low light image enhancement, image dehazing, deblurring, etc.) where textural consistency between recovered and its neighboring regions is important to ensure effective performance. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of a simple copy-blend data augmentation technique that copies patches from noisy images and blends onto a clean image and vice versa to ensure that an underlying algorithm localizes and recovers affected regions resulting in increased perceptual quality of a recovered image. To assess performance improvement, we perform extensive experiments alongside different region modification-based augmentation techniques and report observations such as improved performance, reduced requirement for training dataset, and early convergence across tasks such as low light image enhancement, image dehazing and image deblurring without any modification to baseline algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient and Accurate Multi-scale Topological Network for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12135v1)** | 2021-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem that has drawn significant attention in the last few years. Recently, convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in image dehazing. However, it is still difficult for these increasingly complex models to recover accurate details from the hazy image. In this paper, we pay attention to the feature extraction and utilization of the input image itself. To achieve this, we propose a Multi-scale Topological Network (MSTN) to fully explore the features at different scales. Meanwhile, we design a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module (MFFM) and an Adaptive Feature Selection Module (AFSM) to achieve the selection and fusion of features at different scales, so as to achieve progressive image dehazing. This topological network provides a large number of search paths that enable the network to extract abundant image features as well as strong fault tolerance and robustness. In addition, ASFM and MFFM can adaptively select important features and ignore interference information when fusing different scale representations. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Progressive Depth Learning for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10514v1)** | 2021-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The formulation of the hazy image is mainly dominated by the reflected lights and ambient airlight. Existing dehazing methods often ignore the depth cues and fail in distant areas where heavier haze disturbs the visibility. However, we note that the guidance of the depth information for transmission estimation could remedy the decreased visibility as distances increase. In turn, the good transmission estimation could facilitate the depth estimation for hazy images. In this paper, a deep end-to-end model that iteratively estimates image depths and transmission maps is proposed to perform an effective depth prediction for hazy images and improve the dehazing performance with the guidance of depth information. The image depth and transmission map are progressively refined to better restore the dehazed image. Our approach benefits from explicitly modeling the inner relationship of image depth and transmission map, which is especially effective for distant hazy areas. Extensive results on the benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing methods in terms of depth estimation and haze removal.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FWB-Net:Front White Balance Network for Color Shift Correction in Single Image Dehazing via Atmospheric Light Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08465v1)** | 2021-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, single image dehazing deep models based on Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) have achieved remarkable results. But the dehazing outputs of those models suffer from color shift. Analyzing the ASM model shows that the atmospheric light factor (ALF) is set as a scalar which indicates ALF is constant for whole image. However, for images taken in real-world, the illumination is not uniformly distributed over whole image which brings model mismatch and possibly results in color shift of the deep models using ASM. Bearing this in mind, in this study, first, a new non-homogeneous atmospheric scattering model (NH-ASM) is proposed for improving image modeling of hazy images taken under complex illumination conditions. Second, a new U-Net based front white balance module (FWB-Module) is dedicatedly designed to correct color shift before generating dehazing result via atmospheric light estimation. Third, a new FWB loss is innovatively developed for training FWB-Module, which imposes penalty on color shift. In the end, based on NH-ASM and front white balance technology, an end-to-end CNN-based color-shift-restraining dehazing network is developed, termed as FWB-Net. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed FWB-Net for dehazing on both synthetic and real-world images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Domain Invariant Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10449v1)** | 2021-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Presence of haze in images obscures underlying information, which is undesirable in applications requiring accurate environment information. To recover such an image, a dehazing algorithm should localize and recover affected regions while ensuring consistency between recovered and its neighboring regions. However owing to fixed receptive field of convolutional kernels and non uniform haze distribution, assuring consistency between regions is difficult. In this paper, we utilize an encoder-decoder based network architecture to perform the task of dehazing and integrate an spatially aware channel attention mechanism to enhance features of interest beyond the receptive field of traditional conventional kernels. To ensure performance consistency across diverse range of haze densities, we utilize greedy localized data augmentation mechanism. Synthetic datasets are typically used to ensure a large amount of paired training samples, however the methodology to generate such samples introduces a gap between them and real images while accounting for only uniform haze distribution and overlooking more realistic scenario of non-uniform haze distribution resulting in inferior dehazing performance when evaluated on real datasets. Despite this, the abundance of paired samples within synthetic datasets cannot be ignored. Thus to ensure performance consistency across diverse datasets, we train the proposed network within an adversarial prior-guided framework that relies on a generated image along with its low and high frequency components to determine if properties of dehazed images matches those of ground truth. We preform extensive experiments to validate the dehazing and domain invariance performance of proposed framework across diverse domains and report state-of-the-art (SoTA) results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Domain-Aware Unsupervised Hyperspectral Reconstruction for Aerial Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03677v1)** | 2020-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Haze removal in aerial images is a challenging problem due to considerable variation in spatial details and varying contrast. Changes in particulate matter density often lead to degradation in visibility. Therefore, several approaches utilize multi-spectral data as auxiliary information for haze removal. In this paper, we propose SkyGAN for haze removal in aerial images. SkyGAN consists of 1) a domain-aware hazy-to-hyperspectral (H2H) module, and 2) a conditional GAN (cGAN) based multi-cue image-to-image translation module (I2I) for dehazing. The proposed H2H module reconstructs several visual bands from RGB images in an unsupervised manner, which overcomes the lack of hazy hyperspectral aerial image datasets. The module utilizes task supervision and domain adaptation in order to create a "hyperspectral catalyst" for image dehazing. The I2I module uses the hyperspectral catalyst along with a 12-channel multi-cue input and performs effective image dehazing by utilizing the entire visual spectrum. In addition, this work introduces a new dataset, called Hazy Aerial-Image (HAI) dataset, that contains more than 65,000 pairs of hazy and ground truth aerial images with realistic, non-homogeneous haze of varying density. The performance of SkyGAN is evaluated on the recent SateHaze1k dataset as well as the HAI dataset. We also present a comprehensive evaluation of HAI dataset with a representative set of state-of-the-art techniques in terms of PSNR and SSIM.</p></details> | WACV-2021 | None |

Single image dehazing is a challenging and ill-posed problem, despite being widely studied. Most existing methods assume that haze has a uniform/homogeneous distribution and haze can have a single color, i.e. grayish white color similar to smoke, while in reality haze can be distributed non-uniformly with different patterns and colors. In this paper, we focus on haze created by sunlight as it is one of the most prevalent type of haze in the wild. Sunlight can generate non-uniformly distributed haze with drastic density changes due to sun rays and also a spectrum of haze color due to sunlight color changes during the day. This presents a new challenge to image dehazing methods. For these methods to be practical, this problem needs to be addressed. To quantify the challenges and assess the performance of these methods, we present a sunlight haze benchmark dataset, Sun-Haze, containing 107 hazy images with different types of haze created by sunlight having a variety of intensity and color. We evaluate a representative set of state-of-the-art image dehazing methods on this benchmark dataset in terms of standard metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, CIEDE2000, PI and NIQE. This uncovers the limitation of the current methods, and questions their underlying assumptions as well as their practicality.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome these problems, our proposed generic model uses a very light convolutional encoder-decoder network which does not depend on any atmospheric models. The network complexity-image quality trade off is handled well in this neural network and the performance of this network is not limited by low-spec systems. This network achieves optimum dehazing performance at a much faster rate, on several standard datasets, comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 7 figures in .pdf format and 1 figure in .jpg format</p></details> | None |

The preliminary stage of the proposed approach focuses on the segmentation of sky and non-sky regions in a foggy image taking the advantageous of Meanshift and edge detection with embedded confidence. In the second stage, an improved dark channel priori algorithm is employed to defog the non-sky region. Ultimately, the sky area is processed by DehazeNet algorithm, which relies on deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid approach in this research addresses the problem of color distortion associated with sky regions in foggy images. The approach greatly improves the image quality indices including entropy information, visibility ratio of the edges, average gradient, and the saturation percentage with a very fast computation time, which is a good indication of the excellent performance of this model.</p></details> |  | None |

An unsupervised neural network will avoid the intensive labor collection of hazy-clean image pairs, and an untrained model is a ``real'' single image dehazing approach which could remove haze based on only the observed hazy image itself and no extra images is used. Motivated by the layer disentanglement idea, we propose a novel method, called you only look yourself (\textbf{YOLY}) which could be one of the first unsupervised and untrained neural networks for image dehazing. In brief, YOLY employs three jointly subnetworks to separate the observed hazy image into several latent layers, \textit{i.e.}, scene radiance layer, transmission map layer, and atmospheric light layer. After that, these three layers are further composed to the hazy image in a self-supervised manner. Thanks to the unsupervised and untrained characteristics of YOLY, our method bypasses the conventional training paradigm of deep models on hazy-clean pairs or a large scale dataset, thus avoids the labor-intensive data collection and the domain shift issue. Besides, our method also provides an effective learning-based haze transfer solution thanks to its layer disentanglement mechanism. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our method in image dehazing compared with 14 methods on four databases.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CIE XYZ Net: Unprocessing Images for Low-Level Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12709v1)** | 2020-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cameras currently allow access to two image states: (i) a minimally processed linear raw-RGB image state (i.e., raw sensor data) or (ii) a highly-processed nonlinear image state (e.g., sRGB). There are many computer vision tasks that work best with a linear image state, such as image deblurring and image dehazing. Unfortunately, the vast majority of images are saved in the nonlinear image state. Because of this, a number of methods have been proposed to "unprocess" nonlinear images back to a raw-RGB state. However, existing unprocessing methods have a drawback because raw-RGB images are sensor-specific. As a result, it is necessary to know which camera produced the sRGB output and use a method or network tailored for that sensor to properly unprocess it. This paper addresses this limitation by exploiting another camera image state that is not available as an output, but it is available inside the camera pipeline. In particular, cameras apply a colorimetric conversion step to convert the raw-RGB image to a device-independent space based on the CIE XYZ color space before they apply the nonlinear photo-finishing. Leveraging this canonical image state, we propose a deep learning framework, CIE XYZ Net, that can unprocess a nonlinear image back to the canonical CIE XYZ image. This image can then be processed by any low-level computer vision operator and re-rendered back to the nonlinear image. We demonstrate the usefulness of the CIE XYZ Net on several low-level vision tasks and show significant gains that can be obtained by this processing framework.

This paper proposes a novel Context Guided Generative Adversarial Network (CGGAN) for single image dehazing. Of which, an novel new encoder-decoder is employed as the generator. And it consists of a feature-extraction-net, a context-extractionnet, and a fusion-net in sequence. The feature extraction-net acts as a encoder, and is used for extracting haze features. The context-extraction net is a multi-scale parallel pyramid decoder, and is used for extracting the deep features of the encoder and generating coarse dehazing image. The fusion-net is a decoder, and is used for obtaining the final haze-free image. To obtain more better results, multi-scale information obtained during the decoding process of the context extraction decoder is used for guiding the fusion decoder. By introducing an extra coarse decoder to the original encoder-decoder, the CGGAN can make better use of the deep feature information extracted by the encoder. To ensure our CGGAN work effectively for different haze scenarios, different loss functions are employed for the two decoders. Experiments results show the advantage and the effectiveness of our proposed CGGAN, evidential improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods are obtained.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, most existing methods train a dehazing model on synthetic hazy images, which are less able to generalize well to real hazy images due to domain shift. To address this issue, we propose a domain adaptation paradigm, which consists of an image translation module and two image dehazing modules. Specifically, we first apply a bidirectional translation network to bridge the gap between the synthetic and real domains by translating images from one domain to another. And then, we use images before and after translation to train the proposed two image dehazing networks with a consistency constraint. In this phase, we incorporate the real hazy image into the dehazing training via exploiting the properties of the clear image (e.g., dark channel prior and image gradient smoothing) to further improve the domain adaptivity. By training image translation and dehazing network in an end-to-end manner, we can obtain better effects of both image translation and dehazing. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that our model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Patten Recognition (CVPR), 2020</p></details> | None |

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully used in many computer vision problems. In this paper, we propose a Y-net that is named for its structure. This network reconstructs clear images by aggregating multi-scale features maps. Additionally, we propose a Wavelet Structure SIMilarity (W-SSIM) loss function in the training step. In the proposed loss function, discrete wavelet transforms are applied repeatedly to divide the image into differently sized patches with different frequencies and scales. The proposed loss function is the accumulation of SSIM loss of various patches with respective ratios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Y-net with the W-SSIM loss function restores high-quality clear images and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

| **[Physics-Based Generative Adversarial Models for Image Restoration and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00605v2)** | 2020-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an algorithm to directly solve numerous image restoration problems (e.g., image deblurring, image dehazing, image deraining, etc.). These problems are highly ill-posed, and the common assumptions for existing methods are usually based on heuristic image priors. In this paper, we find that these problems can be solved by generative models with adversarial learning. However, the basic formulation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) does not generate realistic images, and some structures of the estimated images are usually not preserved well. Motivated by an interesting observation that the estimated results should be consistent with the observed inputs under the physics models, we propose a physics model constrained learning algorithm so that it can guide the estimation of the specific task in the conventional GAN framework. The proposed algorithm is trained in an end-to-end fashion and can be applied to a variety of image restoration and related low-level vision problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | IEEE TPAMI | None |

This degradation is represented by transmission map which represents the amount of attenuation and airlight which represents the color of additive noise. In this paper, we have proposed a method to estimate the transmission map using haze levels instead of airlight color since there are some ambiguities in estimation of airlight. Qualitative and quantitative results of proposed method show competitiveness of the method given. In addition we have proposed two metrics which are based on statistics of natural outdoor images for assessment of haze removal algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IBA-ICICT 2019</p></details> | None |
| **[Single Image Dehazing Using Ranking Convolutional Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05246v1)** | 2020-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single image dehazing, which aims to recover the clear image solely from an input hazy or foggy image, is a challenging ill-posed problem. Analysing existing approaches, the common key step is to estimate the haze density of each pixel. To this end, various approaches often heuristically designed haze-relevant features. Several recent works also automatically learn the features via directly exploiting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, it may be insufficient to fully capture the intrinsic attributes of hazy images. To obtain effective features for single image dehazing, this paper presents a novel Ranking Convolutional Neural Network (Ranking-CNN). In Ranking-CNN, a novel ranking layer is proposed to extend the structure of CNN so that the statistical and structural attributes of hazy images can be simultaneously captured. By training Ranking-CNN in a well-designed manner, powerful haze-relevant features can be automatically learned from massive hazy image patches. Based on these features, haze can be effectively removed by using a haze density prediction model trained through the random forest regression. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms several previous dehazing approaches on synthetic and real-world benchmark images. Comprehensive analyses are also conducted to interpret the proposed Ranking-CNN from both the theoretical and experimental aspects.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FFA-Net: Feature Fusion Attention Network for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07559v2)** | 2019-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an end-to-end feature fusion at-tention network (FFA-Net) to directly restore the haze-free image. The FFA-Net architecture consists of three key components: 1) A novel Feature Attention (FA) module combines Channel Attention with Pixel Attention mechanism, considering that different channel-wise features contain totally different weighted information and haze distribution is uneven on the different image pixels. FA treats different features and pixels unequally, which provides additional flexibility in dealing with different types of information, expanding the representational ability of CNNs. 2) A basic block structure consists of Local Residual Learning and Feature Attention, Local Residual Learning allowing the less important information such as thin haze region or low-frequency to be bypassed through multiple local residual connections, let main network architecture focus on more effective information. 3) An Attention-based different levels Feature Fusion (FFA) structure, the feature weights are adaptively learned from the Feature Attention (FA) module, giving more weight to important features. This structure can also retain the information of shallow layers and pass it into deep layers. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FFA-Net surpasses previous state-of-the-art single image dehazing methods by a very large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, boosting the best published PSNR metric from 30.23db to 36.39db on the SOTS indoor test dataset.

This paper proposes an end-to-end generative method for image dehazing. It is based on designing a fully convolutional neural network to recognize haze structures in input images and restore clear, haze-free images. The proposed method is agnostic in the sense that it does not explore the atmosphere scattering model. Somewhat surprisingly, it achieves superior performance relative to all existing state-of-the-art methods for image dehazing even on SOTS outdoor images, which are synthesized using the atmosphere scattering model.

| **[Classification-driven Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09389v1)** | 2019-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing dehazing algorithms often use hand-crafted features or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based methods to generate clear images using pixel-level Mean Square Error (MSE) loss. The generated images generally have better visual appeal, but not always have better performance for high-level vision tasks, e.g. image classification. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing this problem. Instead of focusing only on achieving good quantitative performance on pixel-based metrics such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), we also ensure that the dehazed image itself does not degrade the performance of the high-level vision tasks such as image classification. To this end, we present an unified CNN architecture that includes three parts: a dehazing sub-network (DNet), a classification-driven Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks sub-network (CCGAN) and a classification sub-network (CNet) related to image classification, which has better performance both on visual appeal and image classification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets for fine-grained and object classification: CUB-200-2011 and Caltech-256. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image dehazing methods in terms of image dehazing metrics and classification accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep-Energy: Unsupervised Training of Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12355v2)** | 2019-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep learning has been due, in no small part, to the availability of large annotated datasets. Thus, a major bottleneck in current learning pipelines is the time-consuming human annotation of data. In scenarios where such input-output pairs cannot be collected, simulation is often used instead, leading to a domain-shift between synthesized and real-world data. This work offers an unsupervised alternative that relies on the availability of task-specific energy functions, replacing the generic supervised loss. Such energy functions are assumed to lead to the desired label as their minimizer given the input. The proposed approach, termed "Deep Energy", trains a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to approximate this minimization for any chosen input. Once trained, a simple and fast feed-forward computation provides the inferred label. This approach allows us to perform unsupervised training of DNNs with real-world inputs only, and without the need for manually-annotated labels, nor synthetically created data. "Deep Energy" is demonstrated in this paper on three different tasks -- seeded segmentation, image matting and single image dehazing -- exposing its generality and wide applicability. Our experiments show that the solution provided by the network is often much better in quality than the one obtained by a direct minimization of the energy function, suggesting an added regularization property in our scheme.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Single Image Dehazing Using Dark Channel Prior Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07051v2)** | 2019-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single image dehazing is a critical stage in many modern-day autonomous vision applications. Early prior-based methods often involved a time-consuming minimization of a hand-crafted energy function. Recent learning-based approaches utilize the representational power of deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn the underlying transformation between hazy and clear images. Due to inherent limitations in collecting matching clear and hazy images, these methods resort to training on synthetic data; constructed from indoor images and corresponding depth information. This may result in a possible domain shift when treating outdoor scenes. We propose a completely unsupervised method of training via minimization of the well-known, Dark Channel Prior (DCP) energy function. Instead of feeding the network with synthetic data, we solely use real-world outdoor images and tune the network's parameters by directly minimizing the DCP. Although our "Deep DCP" technique can be regarded as a fast approximator of DCP, it actually improves its results significantly. This suggests an additional regularization obtained via the network and learning process. Experiments show that our method performs on par with large-scale supervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The GridDehazeNet consists of three modules: pre-processing, backbone, and post-processing. The trainable pre-processing module can generate learned inputs with better diversity and more pertinent features as compared to those derived inputs produced by hand-selected pre-processing methods. The backbone module implements a novel attention-based multi-scale estimation on a grid network, which can effectively alleviate the bottleneck issue often encountered in the conventional multi-scale approach. The post-processing module helps to reduce the artifacts in the final output. Experimental results indicate that the GridDehazeNet outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-world images. The proposed hazing method does not rely on the atmosphere scattering model, and we provide an explanation as to why it is not necessarily beneficial to take advantage of the dimension reduction offered by the atmosphere scattering model for image dehazing, even if only the dehazing results on synthetic images are concerned.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, accepted in ICCV 2019, project page: https://proteus1991.github.io/GridDehazeNet/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://proteus1991.github.io/GridDehazeNet) |

However, it remains challenging due to its ill-posed nature. Existing dehazing models tend to suffer from model overcomplexity and computational inefficiency or have limited representation capacity. To tackle these challenges, here we propose a fast and accurate multi-scale end-to-end dehazing network called FAMED-Net, which comprises encoders at three scales and a fusion module to efficiently and directly learn the haze-free image. Each encoder consists of cascaded and densely connected point-wise convolutional layers and pooling layers. Since no larger convolutional kernels are used and features are reused layer-by-layer, FAMED-Net is lightweight and computationally efficient. Thorough empirical studies on public synthetic datasets (including RESIDE) and real-world hazy images demonstrate the superiority of FAMED-Net over other representative state-of-the-art models with respect to model complexity, computational efficiency, restoration accuracy, and cross-set generalization.

| **[Learning of Image Dehazing Models for Segmentation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01530v2)** | 2019-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To evaluate their performance, existing dehazing approaches generally rely on distance measures between the generated image and its corresponding ground truth. Despite its ability to produce visually good images, using pixel-based or even perceptual metrics do not guarantee, in general, that the produced image is fit for being used as input for low-level computer vision tasks such as segmentation. To overcome this weakness, we are proposing a novel end-to-end approach for image dehazing, fit for being used as input to an image segmentation procedure, while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the generator by introducing a discriminator network and a loss function that evaluates segmentation quality of dehazed images. In addition, we make use of a supplementary loss function that verifies that the visual and the perceptual quality of the generated image are preserved in hazy conditions. Results obtained using the proposed technique are appealing, with a favorable comparison to state-of-the-art approaches when considering the performance of segmentation algorithms on the hazy images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EUSIPCO 2019</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantic Foggy Scene Understanding with Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07819v3)** | 2019-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the problem of semantic foggy scene understanding (SFSU). Although extensive research has been performed on image dehazing and on semantic scene understanding with clear-weather images, little attention has been paid to SFSU. Due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating foggy images, we choose to generate synthetic fog on real images that depict clear-weather outdoor scenes, and then leverage these partially synthetic data for SFSU by employing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN). In particular, a complete pipeline to add synthetic fog to real, clear-weather images using incomplete depth information is developed. We apply our fog synthesis on the Cityscapes dataset and generate Foggy Cityscapes with 20550 images. SFSU is tackled in two ways: 1) with typical supervised learning, and 2) with a novel type of semi-supervised learning, which combines 1) with an unsupervised supervision transfer from clear-weather images to their synthetic foggy counterparts. In addition, we carefully study the usefulness of image dehazing for SFSU. For evaluation, we present Foggy Driving, a dataset with 101 real-world images depicting foggy driving scenes, which come with ground truth annotations for semantic segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments show that 1) supervised learning with our synthetic data significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art CNN for SFSU on Foggy Driving; 2) our semi-supervised learning strategy further improves performance; and 3) image dehazing marginally advances SFSU with our learning strategy.

Therefore image dehazing for perception enhancement and haze image synthesis for testing perception abilities are equivalently important in the development of such autonomous driving systems. From the view of image translation, these two problems are essentially dual with each other, which have the potentiality to be solved jointly. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation framework based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) to handle haze image synthesis and haze removal simultaneously. Since the KL divergence in the VAE objectives could not guarantee the optimal mapping under imbalanced and unpaired training samples with limited size, Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) based VAE is utilized to ensure the translating consistency in both directions. The comprehensive analysis on both synthesis and dehazing performance of our method demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprinted version on arxiv, May-05-2019</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose an efficient fully convolutional neural network (CNN) image dehazing method designed to run on edge graphical processing units (GPUs). We utilize three variants of our architecture to explore the dependency of dehazed image quality on parameter count and model design. The first two variants presented, a small and big version, make use of a single efficient encoder-decoder convolutional feature extractor. The final variant utilizes a pair of encoder-decoders for atmospheric light and transmission map estimation. Each variant ends with an image refinement pyramid pooling network to form the final dehazed image. For the big variant of the single-encoder network, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the NYU Depth dataset. For the small variant, we maintain competitive performance on the super-resolution O/I-HAZE datasets without the need for image cropping. Finally, we examine some challenges presented by the Dense-Haze dataset when leveraging CNN architectures for dehazing of dense haze imagery and examine the impact of loss function selection on image quality. Benchmarks are included to show the feasibility of introducing this approach into real-time systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NTIRE 2019 CVPR Workshop.

Several prior-based and learning-based methods have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem and they have achieved superior results. However, most of the existing methods assume constant atmospheric light model and tend to follow a two-step procedure involving prior-based methods for estimating transmission map followed by calculation of dehazed image using the closed form solution. In this paper, we relax the constant atmospheric light assumption and propose a novel unified single image dehazing network that jointly estimates the transmission map and performs dehazing. In other words, our new approach provides an end-to-end learning framework, where the inherent transmission map and dehazed result are learned directly from the loss function. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets with challenging hazy images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in IEEE-TCSVT</p></details> | None |
| **[Fast Single Image Dehazing via Multilevel Wavelet Transform based Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08573v1)** | 2019-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of images captured in outdoor environments can be affected by poor weather conditions such as fog, dust, and atmospheric scattering of other particles. This problem can bring extra challenges to high-level computer vision tasks like image segmentation and object detection. However, previous studies on image dehazing suffer from a huge computational workload and corruption of the original image, such as over-saturation and halos. In this paper, we present a novel image dehazing approach based on the optical model for haze images and regularized optimization. Specifically, we convert the non-convex, bilinear problem concerning the unknown haze-free image and light transmission distribution to a convex, linear optimization problem by estimating the atmosphere light constant. Our method is further accelerated by introducing a multilevel Haar wavelet transform. The optimization, instead, is applied to the low frequency sub-band decomposition of the original image. This dimension reduction significantly improves the processing speed of our method and exhibits the potential for real-time applications. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms in terms of both image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

Existing methods rely on a suboptimal two-step approach, where an intermediate product like a depth map is estimated, based on which the haze-free image is subsequently generated using an artificial prior formula. In this paper, we propose a light dual-task Neural Network called LDTNet that restores the haze-free image in one shot. We use transmission map estimation as an auxiliary task to assist the main task, haze removal, in feature extraction and to enhance the generalization of the network. In LDTNet, the haze-free image and the transmission map are produced simultaneously. As a result, the artificial prior is reduced to the smallest extent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior performance against the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures | None |

Despite the significant increase in interest shown for dehazing over the past few years, the validation of the dehazing methods remains largely unsatisfactory, due to the lack of pairs of real hazy and corresponding haze-free reference images. To address this limitation, we introduce Dense-Haze - a novel dehazing dataset. Characterized by dense and homogeneous hazy scenes, Dense-Haze contains 33 pairs of real hazy and corresponding haze-free images of various outdoor scenes. The hazy scenes have been recorded by introducing real haze, generated by professional haze machines. The hazy and haze-free corresponding scenes contain the same visual content captured under the same illumination parameters. Dense-Haze dataset aims to push significantly the state-of-the-art in single-image dehazing by promoting robust methods for real and various hazy scenes. We also provide a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art single image dehazing techniques based on the Dense-Haze dataset. Not surprisingly, our study reveals that the existing dehazing techniques perform poorly for dense homogeneous hazy scenes and that there is still much room for improvement.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[Underwater Single Image Color Restoration Using Haze-Lines and a New Quantitative Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01343v3)** | 2019-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images suffer from color distortion and low contrast, because light is attenuated while it propagates through water. Attenuation under water varies with wavelength, unlike terrestrial images where attenuation is assumed to be spectrally uniform. The attenuation depends both on the water body and the 3D structure of the scene, making color restoration difficult. Unlike existing single underwater image enhancement techniques, our method takes into account multiple spectral profiles of different water types. By estimating just two additional global parameters: the attenuation ratios of the blue-red and blue-green color channels, the problem is reduced to single image dehazing, where all color channels have the same attenuation coefficients. Since the water type is unknown, we evaluate different parameters out of an existing library of water types. Each type leads to a different restored image and the best result is automatically chosen based on color distribution. We collected a dataset of images taken in different locations with varying water properties, showing color charts in the scenes. Moreover, to obtain ground truth, the 3D structure of the scene was calculated based on stereo imaging. This dataset enables a quantitative evaluation of restoration algorithms on natural images and shows the advantage of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, the coarse estimation version is first obtained by weightedly fusing two different transmission maps, which are generated from foreground and sky regions, respectively. A hybrid variational model with promoted regularization terms is then proposed to assisting in refining transmission map. The resulting complicated optimization problem is effectively solved via an alternating direction algorithm. The final haze-free image can be effectively obtained according to the refined transmission map and atmospheric scattering model. Our dehazing framework has the capacity of preserving important image details while suppressing undesirable artifacts, even for hazy images with large sky regions. Experiments on both synthetic and realistic images have illustrated that the proposed method is competitive with or even outperforms the state-of-the-art dehazing techniques under different imaging conditions.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures | None |
