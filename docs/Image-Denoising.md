| **[Image2Gcode: Image-to-G-code Generation for Additive Manufacturing Using Diffusion-Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20636v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanical design and manufacturing workflows conventionally begin with conceptual design, followed by the creation of a computer-aided design (CAD) model and fabrication through material-extrusion (MEX) printing. This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Personalized Generative Low-light Image Denoising and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14327v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cameras' performance in low-light conditions remains suboptimal due to fundamental limitations in photon shot noise and sensor read noise. Generative image restoration methods have shown promising results compared to traditional approaches, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Leveraging the availability of personalized photo galleries of the users, we introduce Diffusion-based Personalized Generative Denoising (DiffPGD), a new approach that builds a customized diffusion model for individual users. Our key innovation lies in the development of an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer serves as a robust prior that can be seamlessly integrated into the diffusion model to restore degraded images without the need for fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that DiffPGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.

| **[STARFlow-V: End-to-End Video Generative Modeling with Normalizing Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20462v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalizing flows (NFs) are end-to-end likelihood-based generative models for continuous data, and have recently regained attention with encouraging progress on image generation. Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>FPGA-...</summary><p>FPGA-based denoising pipeline for PRISM-scale imaging.

| **[TReFT: Taming Rectified Flow Models For One-Step Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20307v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rectified Flow (RF) models have advanced high-quality image and video synthesis via optimal transport theory. However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Back to the Feature: Explaining Video Classifiers with Video Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20295v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are minimal and semantically meaningful modifications of the input of a model that alter the model predictions. They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Restora-Flow: Mask-Guided Image Restoration with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20152v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has emerged as a promising generative approach that addresses the lengthy sampling times associated with state-of-the-art diffusion models and enables a more flexible trajectory design, while maintaining high-quality image generation. This capability makes it suitable as a generative prior for image restoration tasks. Although current methods leveraging flow models have shown promising results in restoration, some still suffer from long processing times or produce over-smoothed results. To address these challenges, we introduce Restora-Flow, a training-free method that guides flow matching sampling by a degradation mask and incorporates a trajectory correction mechanism to enforce consistency with degraded inputs. We evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets across several image restoration tasks involving a mask-based degradation, i.e., inpainting, super-resolution and denoising. We show superior perceptual quality and processing time compared to diffusion and flow matching-based reference methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for WACV 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Blind Adaptive Local Denoising for CEST Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20081v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables molecular-level visualization of low-concentration metabolites by leveraging proton exchange dynamics. However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \textit{in vivo} CEST scans. In these experiments, BALD consistently outperformed state-of-the-art CEST denoisers in both denoising metrics and downstream tasks such as molecular concentration maps estimation and cancer detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unified Text-Image-to-Video Generation: A Training-Free Approach to Flexible Visual Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20629v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation is a critical problem for controllable video generation using both semantic and visual conditions. Most existing methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few pre-defined conditioning settings. To tackle these constraints, we introduce a unified formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models, our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual features into video representations through local image patches. To balance creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning methods by a notable margin. Our method can also generalize to both UNet-based and transformer-based architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Cross-Contrastive Clustering for Multimodal Attributed Graphs with Dual Graph Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20030v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs) are an expressive data model for representing the complex interconnections among entities that associate attributes from multiple data modalities (text, images, etc.). Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2026.

| **[Scale Where It Matters: Training-Free Localized Scaling for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19917v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become the dominant paradigm in text-to-image generation, and test-time scaling (TTS) further improves quality by allocating more computation during inference. However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling. These findings establish localized TTS as a promising new direction for scaling diffusion models at inference time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Batch Denoising for AIGC Service Provisioning in Wireless Edge Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19847v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) service provisioning in wireless edge networks involves two phases: content generation on edge servers and content transmission to mobile devices. In this paper, we take image generation as a representative application and propose a batch denoising framework, followed by a joint optimization of content generation and transmission, with the objective of maximizing the average AIGC service quality under an end-to-end service delay constraint. Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity. Building on the batch solution, we further optimize bandwidth allocation across AIGC services. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in delivering high-quality, lower-latency AIGC services.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[One Attention, One Scale: Phase-Aligned Rotary Positional Embeddings for Mixed-Resolution Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19778v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We identify a core failure mode that occurs when using the usual linear interpolation on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) for mixed-resolution denoising with Diffusion Transformers. When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse. To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly. We demonstrate that CRPA enables high-fidelity and efficient mixed-resolution generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on image and video generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Are Image-to-Video Models Good Zero-Shot Image Editors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19435v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video diffusion models show strong world simulation and temporal reasoning abilities, but their use as zero-shot image editors remains underexplored. We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.</p></details> | technical report | None |
| **[Breaking the Likelihood-Quality Trade-off in Diffusion Models by Merging Pretrained Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19434v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 DeLTa workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficiency vs. Fidelity: A Comparative Analysis of Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Flow Matching on Low-Resource Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19379v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have established a new state-of-the-art in generative image synthesis, yet their deployment is hindered by significant computational overhead during inference, often requiring up to 1,000 iterative steps. This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of DDPMs against the emerging Flow Matching (Rectified Flow) paradigm, specifically isolating their geometric and efficiency properties on low-resource hardware. By implementing both frameworks on a shared Time-Conditioned U-Net backbone using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that Flow Matching significantly outperforms Diffusion in efficiency. Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\mathcal{C} \approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\mathcal{C} \approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}</p></details> |  | None |
| **[In-Situ Tweedie Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating continuous data such as images, adapting them to discrete tasks has relied on indirect approaches that either operate in continuous embedding spaces or use token masking mechanisms, both of which deviate from modeling the true discrete data distribution that can be theoretically guaranteed by Tweedie's formula. We propose in-situ Tweedie Discrete Diffusion (TDD), a framework that performs diffusion guaranteed by Tweedie's formula directly within the discrete one-hot space, hence "in-situ." Unlike prior methods that diffuse continuous embeddings or mask tokens, TDD directly corrupts one-hot vectors with Gaussian noise and performs iterative denoising through a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy objective rather than mean-squared-error reconstruction. At each denoising step, the model predicts class probabilities, applies argmax to obtain discrete predictions, converts them to one-hot vectors, and feeds them into the next iteration with progressively reduced noise. This process naturally unifies discriminative classification and generative modeling under a single framework. Experiments demonstrate that TDD achieves strong performance on both image classification and text generation tasks, with extensive ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each design component. Our work establishes a principled approach to discrete diffusion that preserves the core characteristics of diffusion models while operating natively in discrete space.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Test-Time Preference Optimization for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19169v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) models are typically trained to recover high-quality images using L1 or LPIPS loss. To handle diverse unknown degradations, zero-shot IR methods have also been introduced. However, existing pre-trained and zero-shot IR approaches often fail to align with human preferences, resulting in restored images that may not be favored. This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed pipeline.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI26 | None |
| **[3M-TI: High-Quality Mobile Thermal Imaging via Calibration-free Multi-Camera Cross-Modal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19117v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Rigorous evaluations on the widely-used MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that PFADSeg exhibits excellent performance, achieving an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OMGSR: You Only Need One Mid-timestep Guidance for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08227v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) show promising potential in one-step Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Current one-step Real-ISR methods typically inject the low-quality (LQ) image latent representation at the start or end timestep of the DDPM scheduler. Recent studies have begun to note that the LQ image latent and the pre-trained noisy latent representations are intuitively closer at a mid-timestep. However, a quantitative analysis of these latent representations remains lacking. Considering these latent representations can be decomposed into signal and noise, we propose a method based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to pre-compute an average optimal mid-timestep for injection. To better approximate the pre-trained noisy latent representation, we further introduce the Latent Representation Refinement (LRR) loss via a LoRA-enhanced VAE encoder. We also fine-tune the backbone of the DDPM-based generative model using LoRA to perform one-step denoising at the average optimal mid-timestep. Based on these components, we present OMGSR, a GAN-based Real-ISR framework that employs a DDPM-based generative model as the generator and a DINOv3-ConvNeXt model with multi-level discriminator heads as the discriminator. We also propose the DINOv3-ConvNeXt DISTS (Dv3CD) loss, which is enhanced for structural perception at varying resolutions. Within the OMGSR framework, we develop OMGSR-S based on SD2.1-base.

| **[SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264v4)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion.

While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages (including references and supplementary material), 10 figures, 7 tables.

Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing GAN-based approaches face some barriers to achieving higher quality output, and have poor generalization performance over different mask types. In this paper, we present our 360-degree indoor RGB-D panorama outpainting model using latent diffusion models (LDM), called PanoDiffusion. We introduce a new bi-modal latent diffusion structure that utilizes both RGB and depth panoramic data during training, which works surprisingly well to outpaint depth-free RGB images during inference. We further propose a novel technique of introducing progressive camera rotations during each diffusion denoising step, which leads to substantial improvement in achieving panorama wraparound consistency. Results show that our PanoDiffusion not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-D panorama outpainting by producing diverse well-structured results for different types of masks, but can also synthesize high-quality depth panoramas to provide realistic 3D indoor models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sm0kywu.github.io/panodiffusion/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sm0kywu.github.io/panodiffusion) |

Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., canny edge) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning-based approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. Through an empirical analysis of existing methods, we identify a key limitation: the sampling schedule of condition features, previously unexplored, fails to account for the evolving interplay between structure preservation and domain alignment throughout diffusion steps. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible training-free framework that decouples the sampling schedule of condition features from the denoising process, and systematically investigate the spectrum of feature injection schedules for a higher-quality structure guidance in the feature space. Specifically, we find that condition features sampled from a single timestep are sufficient, yielding a simple yet efficient schedule that balances structure alignment and appearance quality. We further enhance the sampling process by introducing a restart refinement schedule, and improve the visual quality with an appearance-rich prompting strategy. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

We revisit this paradigm and show that image editing diffusion models are inherently image-to-image consistent, providing a more suitable foundation for dense perception task. We introduce Edit2Perceive, a unified diffusion framework that adapts editing models for depth, normal, and matting. Built upon the FLUX.1 Kontext architecture, our approach employs full-parameter fine-tuning and a pixel-space consistency loss to enforce structure-preserving refinement across intermediate denoising states. Moreover, our single-step deterministic inference yields up to faster runtime while training on relatively small datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate comprehensive state-of-the-art results across all three tasks, revealing the strong potential of editing-oriented diffusion transformers for geometry-aware perception.</p></details> |  | None |

Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model. Additionally, it integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, allowing more compute to uncertain regions and frames. This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with negligible perceptual degradation of less than 5%, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency in NVS serving.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we study TabPFN through the lens of signal reconstruction and provide the first frequency-based analysis of its in-context learning behavior. We show that TabPFN possesses a broader effective frequency capacity than standard ReLU-MLPs, even without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, unlike MLPs whose spectra evolve primarily over training epochs, we find that TabPFN's spectral capacity adapts directly to the number of samples provided in-context, a phenomenon we term Spectral Adaptivity. We further demonstrate that positional encoding modulates TabPFN's frequency response, mirroring classical results in implicit neural representations. Finally, we show that these properties enable TabPFN to perform training-free and hyperparameter-free image denoising, illustrating its potential as a task-agnostic implicit model. Our analysis provides new insight into the structure and inductive biases of tabular foundation models and highlights their promise for broader signal reconstruction tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VCE: Safe Autoregressive Image Generation via Visual Contrast Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16986v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, autoregressive image generation models have wowed audiences with their remarkable capability in creating surprisingly realistic images. Models such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure, explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts.

In this paper, we propose InvAD, a novel inversion-based anomaly detection approach ("detection via noising in latent space") that circumvents explicit reconstruction. Importantly, we contend that the limitations in prior reconstruction-based methods originate from the prevailing "detection via denoising in RGB space" paradigm. To address this, we model AD under a reconstruction-free formulation, which directly infers the final latent variable corresponding to the input image via DDIM inversion, and then measures the deviation based on the known prior distribution for anomaly scoring. Specifically, in approximating the original probability flow ODE using the Euler method, we enforce only a few inversion steps to noise the clean image to pursue inference efficiency. As the added noise is adaptively derived with the learned diffusion model, the original features for the clean testing image can still be leveraged to yield high detection accuracy. We perform extensive experiments and detailed analyses across four widely used industrial and medical AD benchmarks under the unsupervised unified setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving state-of-the-art AD performance and approximately 2x inference-time speedup without diffusion distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/SkyShunsuke/InversionAD</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SkyShunsuke/InversionAD) |

Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks, such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves 8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM. Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks. We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules, highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging.

However, the degenerate PPP method exhibits weak convergence in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and lacks accelerated variants. To address these issues, we propose a Halpern-type PPP (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence and acceleration properties of Halpern's iteration method. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for image restoration by combining HPPP with denoiser priors such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) prior, which can be viewed as an accelerated PnP method. Finally, numerical experiments including several toy examples and image restoration validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Real Noise Decoupling for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17196v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Energy Scaling Laws for Diffusion Models: Quantifying Compute and Carbon Emissions in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17031v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly growing computational demands of diffusion models for image generation have raised significant concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EurIPS 2025 workshop "Rethinking AI: Efficiency, Frugality, and Sustainability"</p></details> | None |

We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance.

While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality in real-world scenarios - for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce OMFA (One Model For All), a unified diffusion framework for both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition garments and supports arbitrary poses. OMFA is inspired by language modeling, where generation is guided by conditioning prompts. However, our framework differs fundamentally from LLMs in two key aspects. First, it employs a bidirectional modeling paradigm that symmetrically allows prompting either from the garment to generate try-on results or from the dressed person to recover the try-off garment. Second, it strictly adheres to Tweedie's formula, enabling faithful estimation of the underlying data distribution during the denoising process. Instead of imposing lower body constraints, OMFA is an entirely mask-free framework that requires only a single portrait and a target garment as input, and is designed to support flexible outfit combinations and cross-person garment transfer, making it better aligned with practical usage scenarios. Additionally, by leveraging SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a practical solution for virtual garment synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current state-of-the-art video models still lag behind image models in visual quality and user control over generated content. In this paper, we introduce TokenWarping, a novel framework for temporally coherent video translation. Existing diffusion-based video editing approaches rely solely on key and value patches in self-attention to ensure temporal consistency, often sacrificing the preservation of local and structural regions. Critically, these methods overlook the significance of the query patches in achieving accurate feature aggregation and temporal coherence. In contrast, TokenWarping leverages complementary token priors by constructing temporal correlations across different frames. Our method begins by extracting optical flows from source videos. During the denoising process of the diffusion model, these optical flows are used to warp the previous frame's query, key, and value patches, aligning them with the current frame's patches. By directly warping the query patches, we enhance feature aggregation in self-attention, while warping the key and value patches ensures temporal consistency across frames. This token warping imposes explicit constraints on the self-attention layer outputs, effectively ensuring temporally coherent translation. Our framework does not require any additional training or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated with existing text-to-image editing methods. We conduct extensive experiments on various video translation tasks, demonstrating that TokenWarping surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Video demonstrations are available in supplementary materials.</p></details> |  | None |

Furthermore, under a fixed computational budget, our model is able to produce high-quality images while DDPM fails to generate recognizable content, illustrating our approach is a practical method for efficient generation in resource-limited settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Spectral Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19873v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Deep Spectral Prior (DSP), a new framework for unsupervised image reconstruction that operates entirely in the complex frequency domain. Unlike the Deep Image Prior (DIP), which optimises pixel-level errors and is highly sensitive to overfitting, DSP performs joint learning of amplitude and phase to capture the full spectral structure of images. We derive a rigorous theoretical characterisation of DSP's optimisation dynamics, proving that it follows frequency-dependent descent trajectories that separate informative low-frequency modes from stochastic high-frequency noise. This spectral mode separation explains DSP's self-regularising behaviour and, for the first time, formally establishes the elimination of DIP's major limitation-its reliance on manual early stopping. Moreover, DSP induces an implicit projection onto a frequency-consistent manifold, ensuring convergence to stable, physically plausible reconstructions without explicit priors or supervision. Extensive experiments on denoising, inpainting, and deblurring demonstrate that DSP consistently surpasses DIP and other unsupervised baselines, achieving superior fidelity, robustness, and theoretical interpretability within a unified, unsupervised data-free framework.</p></details> |  | None |

However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names. In conclusion, MARVAL demonstrates the first practical path to distillation and RL of masked auto-regressive diffusion models, enabling fast sampling and better preference alignments.</p></details> |  | None |

We present jointly conditioned diffusion model (JCDM), a jointly conditioned diffusion framework that exploits multi-view priors. The appearance prior module (APM) infers a holistic identity preserving prior from incomplete references, and the joint conditional injection (JCI) mechanism fuses multi-view cues and injects shared conditioning into the denoising backbone to align identity, color, and texture across poses. JCDM supports a variable number of reference views and integrates with standard diffusion backbones with minimal and targeted architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate state of the art fidelity and cross-view consistency.</p></details> |  | None |

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

To address these issues, we introduce the Transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) regularizer applied to image gradients. In particular, we develop a TL1-regularized denoising model and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), featuring a closed-form TL1 proximal operator and an FFT-based image update under periodic boundary conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior denoising performance, effectively suppressing noise while preserving edges and enhancing image contrast.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to different acquisition conditions, there may exist spectral variability and spatially localized changes between HSI and MSI, referred to as inter-image variability, which can significantly affect the fusion performance. Existing methods typically handle inter-image variability by applying direct transformations to the images themselves, which can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the fusion model. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion (DLRRF) model. First, we model the spectral variability as change in the spectral degradation operator. Second, to recover the lost spatial details caused by spatially localized changes, we decompose the target HSI into low rank and residual components, where the latter is used to capture the lost details. By exploiting the spectral correlation within the images, we perform dimensionality reduction on both components. Additionally, we introduce an implicit regularizer to utilize the spatial prior information from the images. The proposed DLRRF model is solved using the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm within a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, where the subproblem regarding implicit regularizer is addressed by an external denoiser. We further provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that DLRRF achieves superior performance in fusing HSI and MSI with inter-image variability.</p></details> |  | None |

Low-dose CT (LDCT) helps mitigate radiation exposure but simultaneously leads to reduced image quality. Consequently, researchers have sought to reconstruct clear images from LDCT scans using artificial intelligence-based image enhancement techniques. However, these studies typically rely on synthetic LDCT images for algorithm training, which introduces significant domain-shift issues and limits the practical effectiveness of these algorithms in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we constructed a real-world paired lung dataset, referred to as Patient-uLDCT (ultra-low-dose CT), by performing multiple scans on volunteers. The radiation dose for the low-dose images in this dataset is only 2% of the normal dose, substantially lower than the conventional 25% low-dose and 10% ultra-low-dose levels. Furthermore, to resolve the anatomical misalignment between normal-dose and uLDCT images caused by respiratory motion during acquisition, we propose a novel purification strategy to construct corresponding aligned image pairs. Finally, we introduce a Frequency-domain Flow Matching model (FFM) that achieves excellent image reconstruction performance.

However, its high computational cost limits practical applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising, which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image processing tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in solving imaging inverse problems, where data-driven regularizers are used increasingly, leading to remarkably high-fidelity reconstruction. A particularly notable approach for data-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors in iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms, commonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a brief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short review of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal splitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned denoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such replacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting optimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the foundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent diffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances regarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal settings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy for convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local homogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design, including choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.</p></details> |  | None |

This work challenges this belief. Motivated by research on blind image denoising, we investigate a variety of denoising-based generative models in the absence of noise conditioning. To our surprise, most models exhibit graceful degradation, and in some cases, they even perform better without noise conditioning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the error caused by removing noise conditioning and demonstrate that our analysis aligns with empirical observations. We further introduce a noise-unconditional model that achieves a competitive FID of 2.23 on CIFAR-10, significantly narrowing the gap to leading noise-conditional models. We hope our findings will inspire the community to revisit the foundations and formulations of denoising generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update ImageNet experiments (SiT with CFG).

Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than "$\textbf{Just image Transformers}$", or $\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

DDCM leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and replaces the random noise in the backward process with noise sampled from specific sets according to a predefined rule, thereby enabling image compression. However, DDCM cannot be applied to methods other than DDPM. In this paper, we propose the generalized Denoising Diffusion Compression Model (gDDCM), which extends DDCM to mainstream diffusion models and their variants, including DDPM, Score-Based Models, Consistency Models, and Rectified Flow. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10 and LSUN Bedroom datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully generalizes DDCM to the aforementioned models and achieves improved performance.</p></details> | in Chinese language | None |

We propose MRIQT, a 3D conditional diffusion framework for image quality transfer (IQT) from uLF to HF MRI. MRIQT combines realistic K-space degradation for physics-consistent uLF simulation, v-prediction with classifier-free guidance for stable image-to-image generation, and an SNR-weighted 3D perceptual loss for anatomical fidelity. The model denoises from a noised uLF input conditioned on the same scan, leveraging volumetric attention-UNet architecture for structure-preserving translation. Trained on a neonatal cohort with diverse pathologies, MRIQT surpasses recent GAN and CNN baselines in PSNR 15.3% with 1.78% over the state of the art, while physicians rated 85% of its outputs as good quality with clear pathology present. MRIQT enables high-fidelity, diffusion-based enhancement of portable ultra-low-field (uLF) MRI for deliable neonatal brain assessment.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Physics-Guided Image Dehazing Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21385v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the domain gap between real-world and synthetic hazy images, current data-driven dehazing algorithms trained on synthetic datasets perform well on synthetic data but struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{I}mage \textbf{D}ehazing \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels (IDDM), a novel diffusion process that incorporates the atmospheric scattering model into noise diffusion. IDDM aims to use the gradual haze formation process to help the denoising Unet robustly learn the distribution of clear images from the conditional input hazy images. We design a specialized training strategy centered around IDDM. Diffusion models are leveraged to bridge the domain gap from synthetic to real-world, while the atmospheric scattering model provides physical guidance for haze formation. During the forward process, IDDM simultaneously introduces haze and noise into clear images, and then robustly separates them during the sampling process. By training with physics-guided information, IDDM shows the ability of domain generalization, and effectively restores the real-world hazy images despite being trained on synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generative Perception of Shape and Material from Differential Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02473v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving the shape and material of an object from a single image is inherently ambiguous, especially when lighting is unknown and unconstrained. Despite this, humans can often disentangle shape and material, and when they are uncertain, they often move their head slightly or rotate the object to help resolve the ambiguities. Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel conditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of shape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential motions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in pixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object simultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos with supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent behavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions of plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and when objects move, the distributions converge to more accurate explanations. The model also produces high-quality shape-and-material estimates for less ambiguous, real-world objects. By moving beyond single-view to continuous motion observations, and by using generative perception to capture visual ambiguities, our work suggests ways to improve visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent methods attempt to address this dilemma by regularizing high-dimensional latent spaces using external vision foundation models (VFMs). However, it remains unclear how high-dimensional VAE latents affect the optimization of generative models. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to reveal that redundant high-frequency components in high-dimensional latent spaces hinder the training convergence of diffusion models and, consequently, degrade generation quality. To alleviate this problem, we propose a spectral self-regularization strategy to suppress redundant high-frequency noise while simultaneously preserving reconstruction quality. The resulting Denoising-VAE, a ViT-based autoencoder that does not rely on VFMs, produces cleaner, lower-noise latents, leading to improved generative quality and faster optimization convergence. We further introduce a spectral alignment strategy to facilitate the optimization of Denoising-VAE-based generative models. Our complete method enables diffusion models to converge approximately 2$\times$ faster than with SD-VAE, while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality (rFID = 0.28, PSNR = 27.26) and competitive generation performance (gFID = 1.82) on the ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Diffusion Model Based Signal Recovery Under 1-Bit Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12471v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated to be powerful priors for signal recovery, but their application to 1-bit quantization tasks, such as 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression, remains a challenge. This difficulty stems from the inherent non-linear link function in these tasks, which is either non-differentiable or lacks an explicit characterization. To tackle this issue, we introduce Diff-OneBit, which is a fast and effective DM-based approach for signal recovery under 1-bit quantization. Diff-OneBit addresses the challenge posed by non-differentiable or implicit links functions via leveraging a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization, thereby enabling gradient based iterations. This function is integrated into a flexible plug-and-play framework that decouples the data-fidelity term from the diffusion prior, allowing any pretrained DM to act as a denoiser within the iterative reconstruction process. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ, CelebA and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that Diff-OneBit gives high-fidelity reconstructed images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency across 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This study leverages a hybrid quantum-classical framework in this regard. We combine a pretrained ResNet50 encoder, with a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) to explore quantum-assisted diagnosis. We pre-process the kidney images using denoising and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to enhance feature extraction. We address class imbalance through data augmentation and weighted sampling. Latent features extracted by the encoder are transformed into qubits via angle encoding and processed by a QCNN. The model is evaluated on both 8-qubit and 12-qubit configurations. Both architectures achieved rapid convergence with stable learning curves and high consistency between training and validation performance. The models reached a test accuracy of 0.99, with the 12-qubit configuration providing improvements in overall recall and precision, particularly for Cyst and Tumor detection, where it achieved perfect recall for Cysts and a tumor F1-score of 0.9956. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed reliable classification behavior across all classes, with very few misclassifications.

We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel framework based on stochastic differential equations that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with flow matching for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR, CelebA ($64\times64$), and CelebA-HQ ($256\times256$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.

While diffusion models have advanced MDE with impressive generalization, they often exhibit limitations in accurately reconstructing far-range regions. This difficulty arises from two key challenges. First, the implicit multi-scale processing in standard spatial-domain models can be insufficient for preserving the fine-grained, high-frequency details crucial for distant structures. Second, the intrinsic long-tail distribution of depth data imposes a strong training bias towards more prevalent near-range regions. To address these, we propose VistaDepth, a novel diffusion framework designed for balanced and accurate depth perception. We introduce two key innovations. First, the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module enhances the model's ability to represent high-frequency details. It operates by having a lightweight network predict a dynamic, content-aware spectral filter to refine latent features, thereby improving the reconstruction of distant structures. Second, our BiasMap mechanism introduces an adaptive reweighting of the diffusion loss strategically scaled across diffusion timesteps. It further aligns the supervision with the progressive denoising process, establishing a more consistent learning signal. As a result, it mitigates data bias without sacrificing training stability. Experiments show that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion-based MDE, particularly excelling in reconstructing detailed and accurate depth in far-range regions.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Model Inversion Attack Against Deep Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12233v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep hashing improves retrieval efficiency through compact binary codes, yet it introduces severe and often overlooked privacy risks. The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems.</p></details> |  | None |

The performance of denoising is assessed with two metrics: the standard Structural Similarity Index SSIMImg of restored and clean images and a newly applied metric SSIMMap - the SSIM of entropy maps of these images computed via 2D Sample Entropy in sliding windows. We shown that SSIMMap is more sensitive to blur and local intensity transitions and complements SSIMImg. Experiments on low- and high-resolution grayscales images demonstrate that recursive threshold MF robustly restores images even under strong noise (50-60 %), whereas simple AE is only capable of restoring images with low levels of noise (<30 %). We propose two scalable schemes: (i) 2MF, which uses two MFs with different window sizes and a final thresholding step, effective for highlighting sharp local details at low resolution; and (ii) MFs-AE, which aggregates features from multiple MFs via an AE and is beneficial for restoring the overall scene structure at higher resolution. Owing to its simplicity and computational efficiency, MF remains preferable for deployment on resource-constrained platforms (edge/IoT), whereas AE underperforms without prior denoising. The results also validate the practical value of SSIMMap for objective blur assessment and denoising parameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

The core of MoS is a learnable, token-wise router that creates denoising timestep- and input-dependent interactions between modalities' hidden states, precisely aligning token-level features with the diffusion trajectory. This router sparsely selects the top-$k$ hidden states and is trained with an $ε$-greedy strategy, efficiently selecting contextual features with minimal learnable parameters and negligible computational overhead. We validate our design with text-to-image generation (MoS-Image) and editing (MoS-Editing), which achieve state-of-the-art results. With only 3B to 5B parameters, our models match or surpass counterparts up to $4\times$ larger. These findings establish MoS as a flexible and compute-efficient paradigm for scaling multimodal diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Begin-of-Video Tokens for Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12099v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion-based video generation have produced impressive and high-fidelity short videos. To extend these successes to generate coherent long videos, most video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent frames conditioned on previous ones. There are generally two primary paradigms: chunk-based extension and stream denoising. The former directly concatenates previous clean frames as conditioning, suffering from denoising latency and error accumulation. The latter maintains the denoising sequence with monotonically increasing noise levels. In each denoising iteration, one clean frame is produced while a new pure noise is simultaneously appended, enabling live-stream sampling. However, it struggles with fragile consistency and poor motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Begin-of-Video Tokens (ada-BOV) for autoregressive VDMs. The BOV tokens are special learnable embeddings on VDMs. They adaptively absorb denoised preceding frames via an adaptive-layer-norm-like modulation. This design preserves the global consistency while allowing for flexible conditioning in dynamic scenarios. To ensure the quality of local dynamics essential in modulating BOV tokens, we further propose a refinement strategy for stream denoising. It decouples the sampling trajectory length from the attention window size constraint, leading to improved local guidance and overall imaging quality. We also propose a disturbance-augmented training noise schedule, which balances the convergence speed with model robustness for the stream denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves compelling qualitative and quantitative results across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hi-DREAM: Brain Inspired Hierarchical Diffusion for fMRI Reconstruction via ROI Encoder and visuAl Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11437v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FlashI2V: Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting Prevents Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25187v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance. We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.

| **[OT-ALD: Aligning Latent Distributions with Optimal Transport for Accelerated Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11162v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MILD: Multi-Layer Diffusion Strategy for Complex and Precise Multi-IP Aware Human Erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06543v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in image customization tasks. However, existing mask-guided human erasing methods still struggle in complex scenarios such as human-human occlusion, human-object entanglement, and human-background interference, mainly due to the lack of large-scale multi-instance datasets and effective spatial decoupling to separate foreground from background. To bridge these gaps, we curate the MILD dataset capturing diverse poses, occlusions, and complex multi-instance interactions. We then define the Cross-Domain Attention Gap (CAG), an attention-gap metric to quantify semantic leakage. On top of these, we propose Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD), which decomposes the generation process into independent denoising pathways, enabling separate reconstruction of each foreground instance and the background. To enhance human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance, a plug-and-play module that incorporates pose, parsing, and spatial relationships into the diffusion process to improve structural awareness and restoration quality. Additionally, we present Spatially-Modulated Attention, an adaptive mechanism that leverages spatial mask priors to modulate attention across semantic regions, further widening the CAG to effectively minimize boundary artifacts and mitigate semantic leakage. Experiments show that MILD significantly outperforms existing methods. Datasets and code are publicly available at: https://mild-multi-layer-diffusion.github.io/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://mild-multi-layer-diffusion.github.io/) |

Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 19 tables</p></details> | None |

We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

To achieve this, some recent works have been proposed to simultaneously forecast hand trajectories and object affordances on human egocentric videos. The joint prediction serves as a comprehensive representation of future hand-object interactions in 2D space, indicating potential human motion and motivation. However, the existing approaches mostly adopt the autoregressive paradigm for unidirectional prediction, which lacks mutual constraints within the holistic future sequence, and accumulates errors along the time axis. Meanwhile, these works basically overlook the effect of camera egomotion on first-person view predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based interaction prediction method, namely Diff-IP2D, to forecast future hand trajectories and object affordances concurrently in an iterative non-autoregressive manner. We transform the sequential 2D images into latent feature space and design a denoising diffusion model to predict future latent interaction features conditioned on past ones. Motion features are further integrated into the conditional denoising process to enable Diff-IP2D aware of the camera wearer's dynamics for more accurate interaction prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both the off-the-shelf metrics and our newly proposed evaluation protocol. This highlights the efficacy of leveraging a generative paradigm for 2D hand-object interaction prediction.

Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments.

However, these gradients pose significant privacy risks, as sensitive training data is embedded within them. Existing gradient inversion attacks suffer from significantly degraded reconstruction performance when gradients are perturbed by noise-a common defense mechanism. In this paper, we introduce Gradient-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models (GG-CDMs) for reconstructing private images from leaked gradients without prior knowledge of the target data distribution. Our approach leverages the inherent denoising capability of diffusion models to circumvent the partial protection offered by noise perturbation, thereby improving attack performance under such defenses. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction error bounds and the convergence properties of attack loss, characterizing the impact of key factors-such as noise magnitude and attacked model architecture-on reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate our attack's superior reconstruction performance with Gaussian noise-perturbed gradients, and confirm our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  | None |

To reduce the dose level without compromising the image quality, low-dose CT reconstruction has been offered with the availability of compressed sensing based reconstruction methods. Recently, data-driven methods got attention with the rise of deep learning, the availability of high computational power, and big datasets. Deep learning based methods have also been used in low-dose CT reconstruction problem in different manners. Usually, the success of these methods depends on labeled data. However, recent studies showed that training can be achieved successfully with noisy datasets. In this study, we defined a training scheme to use low-dose sinograms as their own training targets. We applied the self-supervision principle in the projection domain where the noise is element-wise independent which is a requirement for self-supervised training methods. Using the self-supervised training, the filtering part of the FBP method and the parameters of a denoiser neural network are optimized. We demonstrate that our method outperforms both conventional and compressed sensing based iterative reconstruction methods qualitatively and quantitatively in the reconstruction of analytic CT phantoms and real-world CT images in low-dose CT reconstruction task.</p></details> |  | None |

Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Fourier-Based Global Denoising Model for Smart Artifacts Removing of Microscopy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09734v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopy such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are essential tools in material imaging at micro- and nanoscale resolutions to extract physical knowledge and materials structure-property relationships. However, tuning microscopy controls (e.g. scanning speed, current setpoint, tip bias etc.) to obtain a high-quality of images is a non-trivial and time-consuming effort. On the other hand, with sub-standard images, the key features are not accurately discovered due to noise and artifacts, leading to erroneous analysis. Existing denoising models mostly build on generalizing the weak signals as noises while the strong signals are enhanced as key features, which is not always the case in microscopy images, thus can completely erase a significant amount of hidden physical information. To address these limitations, we propose a global denoising model (GDM) to smartly remove artifacts of microscopy images while preserving weaker but physically important features. The proposed model is developed based on 1) first designing a two-imaging input channel of non-pair and goal specific pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off information between two channels and 2) then integrating a loss function of pixel- and fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) based on training the U-net model. We compared the proposed GDM with the non-FFT denoising model over STM-generated images of Copper(Cu) and Silicon(Si) materials, AFM-generated Pantoea sp.YR343 bio-film images and SEM-generated plastic degradation images. We believe this proposed workflow can be extended to improve other microscopy image quality and will benefit the experimentalists with the proposed design flexibility to smartly tune via domain-experts preferences.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures | None |

The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.</p></details> |  | None |

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

To address these limitations, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing, which mainly includes a Cross-RWKV Module to capture fine-grained temporal and cross-modal dependencies, and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module to perform joint adaptive frequency-domain denoising and spatial-domain alignment. This continuous interaction maintains feature consistency from low-level textures to high-level semantics. Extensive experiments on the real-world SDE and SDSD datasets demonstrate that EvRWKV significantly outperforms only image-based methods by 1.79 dB and 1.85 dB in PSNR, respectively. To further validate the practical utility of our method for downstream applications, we evaluated its impact on semantic segmentation.

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas.

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme.

To tackle this problem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training data points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative models. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained settings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal objective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed method, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally efficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data containing undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational inference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting of two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer. Plasticity inducer reduces the log-likelihood of the undesired training data points, while the stability regularizer, essential for preventing loss of image generation quality, regularizes the model in parameter space. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments for both class unlearning and feature unlearning. For class unlearning, we unlearn some user-identified classes from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and tinyImageNet datasets from a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Similarly, for feature unlearning, we unlearn the generation of certain high-level features from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce Top2Ground, a novel diffusion-based method that directly generates photorealistic ground-view images from aerial input images without relying on intermediate representations such as depth maps or 3D voxels. Specifically, we condition the denoising process on a joint representation of VAE-encoded spatial features (derived from aerial RGB images and an estimated height map) and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. This design ensures the generation is both geometrically constrained by the scene's 3D structure and semantically consistent with its content. We evaluate Top2Ground on three diverse datasets: CVUSA, CVACT, and the Auto Arborist. Our approach shows 7.3% average improvement in SSIM across three benchmark datasets, showing Top2Ground can robustly handle both wide and narrow fields of view, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels. Trained for just 12 epochs solely on FluxVOC, Cascade HQP-DETR achieves a SOTA 61.04\% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007, outperforming strong baselines, with its competitive real-data performance confirming the architecture's universal applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to Pattern Recognition for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, the redundancy in burst images leads to the increased storage and transmission demands, as well as reduced efficiency of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a new task of Burst Image Quality Assessment (BuIQA), to evaluate the task-driven quality of each frame within a burst sequence, providing reasonable cues for burst image selection. Specifically, we establish the first benchmark dataset for BuIQA, consisting of $7,346$ burst sequences with $45,827$ images and $191,572$ annotated quality scores for multiple downstream scenarios. Inspired by the data analysis, a unified BuIQA framework is proposed to achieve an efficient adaption for BuIQA under diverse downstream scenarios. Specifically, a task-driven prompt generation network is developed with heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to learn the priors of the downstream task. Then, the task-aware quality assessment network is introduced to assess the burst image quality based on the task prompt. Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios demonstrate the impressive BuIQA performance of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it can achieve $0.33$ dB PSNR improvement in the downstream tasks of denoising and super-resolution, by applying our approach to select the high-quality burst frames.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted from NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Structured Probabilistic Inference & Generative Modeling.

Existing restoration methods are typically task-specific and often require prior knowledge of the degradation type, limiting their robustness in real-world clinical use. We propose EndoIR, an all-in-one, degradation-agnostic diffusion-based framework that restores multiple degradation types using a single model. EndoIR introduces a Dual-Domain Prompter that extracts joint spatial-frequency features, coupled with an adaptive embedding that encodes both shared and task-specific cues as conditioning for denoising. To mitigate feature confusion in conventional concatenation-based conditioning, we design a Dual-Stream Diffusion architecture that processes clean and degraded inputs separately, with a Rectified Fusion Block integrating them in a structured, degradation-aware manner. Furthermore, Noise-Aware Routing Block improves efficiency by dynamically selecting only noise-relevant features during denoising. Experiments on SegSTRONG-C and CEC datasets demonstrate that EndoIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple degradation scenarios while using fewer parameters than strong baselines, and downstream segmentation experiments confirm its clinical utility.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://streamdiffusionv2.github.io</p></details> | None |

We assess these approaches across diverse datasets, including CURE-OR, CURE-TSR, SSID+, Set-12, and Chest-Xray, each presenting unique noise challenges. Our analysis employs seven Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics and examines the impact on object detection performance. We find that while BM3D excels in scenarios like blur challenges, NBNet is more effective in complex noise environments such as under-exposure and over-exposure. The study reveals the strengths and limitations of each method, providing insights into the effectiveness of different denoising strategies in varied real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy. On the MVTec AD benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art results (I/P-AUROC: 99.9/99.4), supporting our theoretical framework and demonstrating its practical relevance for automatic inspection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> | None |

Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their application to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves superior restoration performance.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |
| **[Bilevel Learning via Inexact Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06774v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bilevel optimization is a central tool in machine learning for high-dimensional hyperparameter tuning. Its applications are vast; for instance, in imaging it can be used for learning data-adaptive regularizers and optimizing forward operators in variational regularization. These problems are large in many ways: a lot of data is usually available to train a large number of parameters, calling for stochastic gradient-based algorithms. However, exact gradients with respect to parameters (so-called hypergradients) are not available, and their precision is usually linearly related to computational cost. Hence, algorithms must solve the problem efficiently without unnecessary precision. The design of such methods is still not fully understood, especially regarding how accuracy requirements and step size schedules affect theoretical guarantees and practical performance. Existing approaches introduce stochasticity at both the upper level (e.g., in sampling or mini-batch estimates) and the lower level (e.g., in solving the inner problem) to improve generalization, but they typically fix the number of lower-level iterations, which conflicts with asymptotic convergence assumptions. In this work, we advance the theory of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization. We prove convergence and establish rates under decaying accuracy and step size schedules, showing that with optimal configurations convergence occurs at an $\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/4})$ rate in expectation. Experiments on image denoising and inpainting with convex ridge regularizers and input-convex networks confirm our analysis: decreasing step sizes improve stability, accuracy scheduling is more critical than step size strategy, and adaptive preconditioning (e.g., Adam) further boosts performance. These results bridge theory and practice, providing convergence guarantees and practical guidance for large-scale imaging problems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image Restoration via Primal Dual Hybrid Gradient and Flow Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06748v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularized optimization has been a classical approach to solving imaging inverse problems, where the regularization term enforces desirable properties of the unknown image. Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; AAAI26 version with appendix</p></details> | None |

Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements. Overall, Argus achieves 10x fewer latency service-level objective (SLO) violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Middleware 2025</p></details> | None |

A particularly intriguing phenomenon in these models is the emergence of unimodal representation dynamics, where the quality of learned features peaks at an intermediate noise level. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigation of this phenomenon. Leveraging the inherent low-dimensionality structure of image data, we theoretically demonstrate that the unimodal dynamic emerges when the diffusion model successfully captures the underlying data distribution. The unimodality arises from an interplay between denoising strength and class confidence across noise scales. Empirically, we further show that, in classification tasks, the presence of unimodal dynamics reliably reflects the generalization of the diffusion model: it emerges when the model generates novel images and gradually transitions to a monotonically decreasing curve as the model begins to memorize the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

This paper presents an efficient zero-shot diffusion-based compression method that runs substantially faster than existing methods, while maintaining performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art techniques. Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations. This modification is also coupled with an improved encoding protocol. Furthermore, we introduce two flexible variants of Turbo-DDCM, a priority-aware variant that prioritizes user-specified regions and a distortion-controlled variant that compresses an image based on a target PSNR rather than a target BPP. Comprehensive experiments position Turbo-DDCM as a compelling, practical, and flexible image compression scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://amitvaisman.github.io/turbo_ddcm/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://amitvaisman.github.io/turbo_ddcm) |

We trace these limitations to a myopic view of the denoising trajectories that govern diffusion based generation. We introduce EraseFlow, the first framework that casts concept unlearning as exploration in the space of denoising paths and optimizes it with GFlowNets equipped with the trajectory balance objective. By sampling entire trajectories rather than single end states, EraseFlow learns a stochastic policy that steers generation away from target concepts while preserving the model's prior. EraseFlow eliminates the need for carefully crafted reward models and by doing this, it generalizes effectively to unseen concepts and avoids hackable rewards while improving the performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that EraseFlow outperforms existing baselines and achieves an optimal trade off between performance and prior preservation.</p></details> |  | None |

In addition, traditional static condition control makes it difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network, demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61.

This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, submitted to ISBI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Frequency-Adaptive Learning for SAR Despeckling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05890v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are inherently corrupted by speckle noise, limiting their utility in high-precision applications. While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 14 figures,9 tables</p></details> | None |

While full GMMs suffer from the overparameterization of their covariance matrices in high-dimensional spaces, spherical GMMs (with isotropic covariance matrices) certainly lack flexibility to fit certain anisotropic distributions. Connecting these two extremes, we introduce a new family of parsimonious GMMs with piecewise-constant covariance eigenvalue profiles. These extend several low-rank models like the celebrated mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA), by enabling any possible sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. If the latter are prespecified, then we can naturally derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the mixture parameters. Otherwise, to address the notoriously-challenging issue of jointly learning the mixture parameters and hyperparameters, we propose a componentwise penalized EM algorithm, whose monotonicity is proven. We show the superior likelihood-parsimony tradeoffs achieved by our models on a variety of unsupervised experiments: density fitting, clustering and single-image denoising.</p></details> |  | None |

We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization. Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control, enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5 percent additional cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Recently, 3D reconstruction methods have been used to create implicit neural representations of HSI scenes, which can help localize the target object's nutrient composition spatially and spectrally. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a cutting-edge implicit representation that can be used to render hyperspectral channel compositions of each spatial location from any viewing direction. However, it faces limitations in training time and rendering speed. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-Denoised Hyperspectral Gaussian Splatting (DD-HGS), which enhances the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method with wavelength-aware spherical harmonics, a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based spectral loss, and a diffusion-based denoiser to enable 3D explicit reconstruction of hyperspectral scenes across the full spectral range. We present extensive evaluations on diverse real-world hyperspectral scenes from the Hyper-NeRF dataset to show the effectiveness of DD-HGS. The results demonstrate that DD-HGS achieves new state-of-the-art performance among previously published methods.

Prior analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization, showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions, with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with pre-trained image synthesis models.</p></details> |  | None |

Central to our approach is a novel Multi-view Overlapped Scene Alignment with Implicit Consistency (MOSAIC) model that explicitly considers cross-view dependencies within the same scene in the probabilistic sense. MOSAIC operates through a multi-channel inference-time optimization that avoids error accumulation common in sequential or single-room constraints in panorama-based approaches. MOSAIC scales to complex scenes with zero extra training and provably reduces the variance during denoising process when more overlapping views are added, leading to improved generation quality. Experiments show that MOSAIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on image fidelity metrics in reconstructing complex multi-room environments.

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; https://github.com/emmaleee789/TraCe.git</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/emmaleee789/TraCe.git) |
| **[Systematic Evaluation of Preprocessing Techniques for Accurate Image Registration in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04171v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method, which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values (AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 Figures | None |

Under a common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf = 64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234 SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs, highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust pair-free alternative with competitive performance.

However, powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing models now enable realistic content-preserving transformations that can inadvertently remove or distort embedded watermarks. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrating that diffusion-based image editing can effectively break state-of-the-art robust watermarks designed to withstand conventional distortions. We analyze how the iterative noising and denoising process of diffusion models degrades embedded watermark signals, and provide formal proofs that under certain conditions a diffusion model's regenerated image retains virtually no detectable watermark information. Building on this insight, we propose a diffusion-driven attack that uses generative image regeneration to erase watermarks from a given image. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced \emph{guided diffusion} attack that explicitly targets the watermark during generation by integrating the watermark decoder into the sampling loop. We evaluate our approaches on multiple recent deep learning watermarking schemes (e.g., StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate that diffusion-based editing can reduce watermark decoding accuracy to near-zero levels while preserving high visual fidelity of the images. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative model-based edits, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in the era of generative AI.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on 54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%), indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos, the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset design toolbox for medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose a diffusion model guided by neural operators for continuous remote sensing image super-resolution (NeurOp-Diff). Neural operators are used to learn resolution representations at arbitrary scales, encoding low-resolution (LR) images into high-dimensional features, which are then used as prior conditions to guide the diffusion model for denoising. This effectively addresses the artifacts and excessive smoothing issues present in existing super-resolution (SR) methods, enabling the generation of high-quality, continuous super-resolution images. Specifically, we adjust the super-resolution scale by a scaling factor s, allowing the model to adapt to different super-resolution magnifications. Furthermore, experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurOp-Diff.

Traditional optical imaging is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

These methods effectively invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions.

Our model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Methods: Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPMs), Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models (BBDMs), U-Net, Pix2Pix, and Vector-Quantised Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-GAN) were used to generate high-quality spectral-domain (SD) vitreous OCT images. Inputs were SD ART10 images, and outputs were compared to pseudoART100 images obtained by averaging ten ART10 images per eye location. Model performance was assessed using image quality metrics and Visual Turing Tests, where ophthalmologists ranked generated images and evaluated anatomical fidelity. The best model's performance was further tested within the manually segmented vitreous on newly acquired data. Results: U-Net achieved the highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR: 30.230) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM: 0.820), followed by cDDPM. For Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), Pix2Pix (0.697) and cDDPM (0.753) performed best. In the first Visual Turing Test, cDDPM ranked highest (3.07); in the second (best model only), cDDPM achieved a 32.9% fool rate and 85.7% anatomical preservation. On newly acquired data, cDDPM generated vitreous regions more similar in PSNR to the ART100 reference than true ART1 or ART10 B-scans and achieved higher PSNR on whole images when conditioned on ART1 than ART10. Conclusions: Results reveal discrepancies between quantitative metrics and clinical evaluation, highlighting the need for combined assessment. cDDPM showed strong potential for generating clinically meaningful vitreous OCT images while reducing acquisition time fourfold. Translational Relevance: cDDPMs show promise for clinical integration, supporting faster, higher-quality vitreous imaging. Dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing methods have achieved progress under constrained settings, interactive retrieval in the open-world scenario still suffers from limited model generalization and insufficient semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose FitPro, an open-world interactive zero-shot TPR framework with enhanced semantic comprehension and cross-scene adaptability. FitPro has three innovative components: Feature Contrastive Decoding (FCD), Incremental Semantic Mining (ISM), and Query-aware Hierarchical Retrieval (QHR). The FCD integrates prompt-guided contrastive decoding to generate high-quality structured pedestrian descriptions from denoised images, effectively alleviating semantic drift in zero-shot scenarios. The ISM constructs holistic pedestrian representations from multi-view observations to achieve global semantic modeling in multi-turn interactions, thereby improving robustness against viewpoint shifts and fine-grained variations in descriptions. The QHR dynamically optimizes the retrieval pipeline according to query types, enabling efficient adaptation to multi-modal and multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments on five public datasets and two evaluation protocols demonstrate that FitPro significantly overcomes the generalization limitations and semantic modeling constraints of existing methods in interactive retrieval, paving the way for practical deployment.</p></details> | 12pages,6 figures | None |

In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality. In particular, IterRef achieves striking gains under low compute budgets, far surpassing prior state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

However, while safer than radiation-based imaging and more suitable for patients with medical implants, ultrasound suffers from attenuation with depth, limiting the quality of the image. Despite advances in echocardiographic particle image velocimetry (EchoPIV), accurately measuring blood velocity remains challenging due to the technique's limitations and the complexity of blood flow dynamics. Physics-informed machine learning can enhance accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios where noisy or incomplete data challenge purely data-driven approaches. We present a physics-informed neural field model with multi-scale Fourier Feature encoding for estimating blood flow from sparse and noisy ultrasound data without requiring ground truth supervision. We demonstrate that this model achieves consistently low mean squared error in denoising and inpainting both synthetic and real datasets, verified against reference flow fields and ground truth flow rate measurements. While physics-informed neural fields have been widely used to reconstruct medical images, applications to medical flow reconstruction are mostly prominent in Flow MRI. In this work, we adapt methods that have proven effective in other imaging modalities to address the specific challenge of ultrasound-based flow reconstruction.</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures | None |

Recent work integrates future images into the understanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand, generate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and actions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate processes, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our core philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a synchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions to evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance. We ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process that integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve as the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be intrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified tokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques that optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv with 4$\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world evaluations.

| **[UniLumos: Fast and Unified Image and Video Relighting with Physics-Plausible Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01678v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relighting is a crucial task with both practical demand and artistic value, and recent diffusion models have shown strong potential by enabling rich and controllable lighting effects. However, as they are typically optimized in semantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness in visual space, they often produce unrealistic results, such as overexposed highlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. We address this with UniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings RGB-space geometry feedback into a flow matching backbone. By supervising the model with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly align lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical plausibility. Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for supervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising computationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency learning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training regimes. To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a structured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination attributes. Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled attribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large vision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of relighting precision across individual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLumos achieves state-of-the-art relighting quality with significantly improved physical consistency, while delivering a 20x speedup for both image and video relighting.

To improve estimation quality, Plug-and-Play MCMC algorithms, such as PnP-ULA, have been recently developed to accommodate priors encoded by a denoising neural network. Designing scalable samplers for high-dimensional imaging inverse problems remains a challenge: drawing and storing high-dimensional samples can be prohibitive, especially for high-resolution images. To address this issue, this work proposes a distributed sampler based on approximate data augmentation and PnP-ULA to solve very large problems. The proposed sampler uses lightweight denoising convolutional neural network, to efficiently exploit multiple GPUs on a Single Program Multiple Data architecture. Reconstruction performance and scalability are evaluated on several imaging problems. Communication and computation overheads due to the denoiser are carefully discussed. The proposed distributed approach noticeably combines three very precious qualities: it is scalable, enables uncertainty quantification, for a reconstruction performance comparable to other PnP methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ERA-Solver: Error-Robust Adams Solver for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12935v4)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable generation results, the low sampling efficiency of DDPMs still limits further applications. Since DDPMs can be formulated as diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs), various fast sampling methods can be derived from solving diffusion ODEs. However, we notice that previous fast sampling methods with fixed analytical form are not able to robust with the various error patterns in the noise estimated from pretrained diffusion models. In this work, we construct an error-robust Adams solver (ERA-Solver), which utilizes the implicit Adams numerical method that consists of a predictor and a corrector. Different from the traditional predictor based on explicit Adams methods, we leverage a Lagrange interpolation function as the predictor, which is further enhanced with an error-robust strategy to adaptively select the Lagrange bases with lower errors in the estimated noise. The proposed solver can be directly applied to any pretrained diffusion models, without extra training. Experiments on Cifar10, CelebA, LSUN-Church, and ImageNet 64 x 64 (conditional) datasets demonstrate that our proposed ERA-Solver achieves 3.54, 5.06, 5.02, and 5.11 Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for image generation, with only 10 network evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

To explore and extend these advancements to point-cloud-based 3D shape generation, we propose a novel Multi-scale Latent Point Consistency Model (MLPCM). Our MLPCM follows a latent diffusion framework and introduces hierarchical levels of latent representations, ranging from point-level to super-point levels, each corresponding to a different spatial resolution. We design a multi-scale latent integration module along with 3D spatial attention to effectively denoise the point-level latent representations conditioned on those from multiple super-point levels. Additionally, we propose a latent consistency model, learned through consistency distillation, that compresses the prior into a one-step generator. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while preserving the performance of the original teacher model. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Vol demonstrate that MLPCM achieves a 100x speedup in the generation process, while surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of both shape quality and diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Here, we present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization. Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their notable achievements, it has become evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images, which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks. Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy, substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and adversarial training approaches.

While existing caching techniques can accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

| **[Tensor Completion via Monotone Inclusion: Generalized Low-Rank Priors Meet Deep Denoisers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12425v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are naturally represented as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in the monotone inclusion paradigm. Within this framework, deep denoisers are treated as general operators that require far fewer restrictions than in classical optimization based formulations. To better capture holistic structure, we further incorporate generalized low rank priors with weakly convex penalties. Building upon the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low sampling rates. For instance, at a sampling rate of 0.05 for multi dimensional image completion, GTCTV DPC achieves an average mean peak signal to noise ratio (MPSNR) that surpasses the second best method by 0.717 dB, and 0.649 dB for multi spectral images, and color videos, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Poisson Informed Retinex Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04470v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority. In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures and 1 table</p></details> | None |

Existing video-to-4D methods typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines, advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages; 21 figures; 3 tables; project page: https://see-4d.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that the generalization ability of image diffusion models arises from the locality properties of the trained neural network. In particular, when denoising a particular pixel, the model relies on a limited neighborhood of the input image around that pixel, which, according to the previous work, is tightly related to the ability of these models to produce novel images. Since locality is central to generalization, it is crucial to understand why diffusion models learn local behavior in the first place, as well as the factors that govern the properties of locality patterns. In this work, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a statistical property of the image dataset and is not due to the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, as suggested in previous work. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from pixel correlations present in the image datasets. Moreover, locality patterns are drastically different on specialized datasets, approximating principal components of the data's covariance. We use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than prior expert-crafted alternatives. Our key takeaway is that while neural network architectures influence generation quality, their primary role is to capture locality patterns inherent in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 20 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality, while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.</p></details> |  | None |

Even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time, self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other doses. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel method of TUnable-geneRalizatioN Diffusion (TurnDiff) powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction. Firstly, a contextual subdata self-enhancing similarity strategy is designed for denoising centered on the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising, TurnDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing. Comprehensive evaluation on both benchmark datasets and real-world data demonstrates that TurnDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GRPO-Guard: Mitigating Implicit Over-Optimization in Flow Matching via Regulated Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22319v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jingw193.github.io/GRPO-Guard/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jingw193.github.io/GRPO-Guard) |

We propose a novel framework leveraging generative 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models to extract and re-simulate 3D dynamic fluid objects from single-view videos using simulation methods. The fluid geometry represented by 3DGS is initially generated and optimized from single-view images, then denoised, densified, and aligned across frames. We estimate the fluid surface velocity using optical flow, propose a mainstream extraction algorithm to refine it. The 3D volumetric velocity field is then derived from the velocity of the fluid's enclosed surface. The velocity field is therewith converted into a divergence-free, grid-based representation, enabling the optimization of simulation parameters through its differentiability across frames. This process outputs simulation-ready fluid assets with physical dynamics closely matching those observed in the source video. Our approach is applicable to various liquid fluids, including inviscid and viscous types, and allows users to edit the output geometry or extend movement durations seamlessly. This automatic method for creating 3D dynamic fluid assets from single-view videos, easily obtainable from the internet, shows great potential for generating large-scale 3D fluid assets at a low cost.</p></details> |  | None |

In existing literature, decision tree-based methods have been used for estimating continuous functions or piecewise-constant functions. However, they are not flexible enough to estimate the complex shapes of jump location curves (JLCs) in two-dimensional regression functions. In this article, we explore the Oblique-axis Regression Tree (ORT) and propose a method to efficiently estimate piece-wise continuous functions in a general finite dimension with fixed design points. The central idea involves clustering the local pixel intensities by recursive tree partitioning and using the local leaf-only averaging for estimation of the regression function at a given pixel. The proposed method can preserve complex shapes of the JLCs well in a finite-dimensional regression function. Due to a different set of assumptions on the underlying regression function, the overall framework of the proofs is different from what is available in the literature on regression trees. Theoretical analysis and numerical results, particularly on image denoising, indicate that the proposed method effectively preserves complicated edge structures while efficiently removing noise from piecewise continuous regression surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for publication in Statistica Sinica</p></details> | None |

Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning. Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2), combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining, simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise ($σ=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by 4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from noise-aware pretraining.

We introduce a multi-step, attention-guided framework that first segments spectrograms to generate soft masks of biologically relevant energy and then fuses these masks with the raw inputs for multi-band, denoised classification. Image and mask embeddings are integrated via mid-level fusion, enabling the model to focus on salient spectrogram regions while preserving global context. Using real-world recordings from the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park Research Station in Canada, we demonstrate that segmentation-driven attention and mid-level fusion improve signal discrimination, reduce false positive detections, and produce reliable representations for operational marine mammal monitoring across diverse environmental conditions and signal-to-noise ratios. Beyond in-distribution evaluation, we further assess the generalization of Mask-Guided Classification (MGC) under distributional shifts by testing on spectrograms generated with alternative acoustic transformations. While high-capacity baseline models lose accuracy in this Out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, MGC maintains stable performance, with even simple fusion mechanisms (gated, concat) achieving comparable results across distributions. This robustness highlights the capacity of MGC to learn transferable representations rather than overfitting to a specific transformation, thereby reinforcing its suitability for large-scale, real-world biodiversity monitoring. We show that in all experimental settings, the MGC framework consistently outperforms baseline architectures, yielding substantial gains in accuracy on both in-distribution and OOD data.</p></details> |  | None |

Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406 subjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had approximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three human experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and excessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the visual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were neither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected. Evaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and qualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent MR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs than the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs compared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment, the generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from real data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer statistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In conclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion model for brain data without skullstripping or registration. Despite the negative results in statistical testing, the presented DDPMs are capable of generating high-resolution 3D $T_1$-weighted brain images.

In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image, while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions, we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas. For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation, we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache. Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 figures, 18 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Improving Temporal Consistency and Fidelity at Inference-time in Perceptual Video Restoration by Zero-shot Image-based Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25420v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for single-image restoration, but their application to zero-shot video restoration suffers from temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling. In this work, we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion) scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MagicPortrait: Temporally Consistent Face Reenactment with 3D Geometric Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21497v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a method for video face reenactment that integrates a 3D face parametric model into a latent diffusion framework, aiming to improve shape consistency and motion control in existing video-based face generation approaches. Our approach employs the FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions) model as the 3D face parametric representation, providing a unified framework for modeling face expressions and head pose. This not only enables precise extraction of motion features from driving videos, but also contributes to the faithful preservation of face shape and geometry. Specifically, we enhance the latent diffusion model with rich 3D expression and detailed pose information by incorporating depth maps, normal maps, and rendering maps derived from FLAME sequences. These maps serve as motion guidance and are encoded into the denoising UNet through a specifically designed Geometric Guidance Encoder (GGE). A multi-layer feature fusion module with integrated self-attention mechanisms is used to combine facial appearance and motion latent features within the spatial domain. By utilizing the 3D face parametric model as motion guidance, our method enables parametric alignment of face identity between the reference image and the motion captured from the driving video. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method excels at generating high-quality face animations with precise expression and head pose variation modeling. In addition, it demonstrates strong generalization performance on out-of-domain images.

We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First, unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods, delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Enabling Fast and Accurate Neutral Atom Readout through Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25982v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of thousands of qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout. Measuring qubits currently takes milliseconds-much longer than the underlying quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement, long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution. Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but unreliable readout. We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework, GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures | None |

Previous works mostly focus on training neural networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors, which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[CANDI: Hybrid Discrete-Continuous Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22510v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

However, little attention has been paid to the fusion task in complex scenes, leading to sub-optimal results under interference. To fill this gap, we propose a unified framework for infrared and visible images fusion in complex scenes, termed UMCFuse. Specifically, we classify the pixels of visible images from the degree of scattering of light transmission, allowing us to separate fine details from overall intensity. Maintaining a balance between interference removal and detail preservation is essential for the generalization capacity of the proposed method. Therefore, we propose an adaptive denoising strategy for the fusion of detail layers. Meanwhile, we fuse the energy features from different modalities by analyzing them from multiple directions. Extensive fusion experiments on real and synthetic complex scenes datasets cover adverse weather conditions, noise, blur, overexposure, fire, as well as downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, object detection, salient object detection, and depth estimation, consistently indicate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the recent representative methods.

In real-world scenarios, the images may be blurry or noisy due to the influence of weather conditions and inherent limitations of the camera. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a robust depth estimation model. Benefiting from the training strategies of generative networks, generative-based methods often exhibit enhanced robustness. In light of this, we employ a well-converging diffusion model among generative networks for unsupervised monocular depth estimation. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical feature-guided denoising module. This model significantly enriches the model's capacity for learning and interpreting depth distribution by fully leveraging image features to guide the denoising process. Furthermore, we explore the implicit depth within reprojection and design an implicit depth consistency loss. This loss function serves to enhance the performance of the model and ensure the scale consistency of depth within a video sequence. We conduct experiments on the KITTI, Make3D, and our self-collected SIMIT datasets. The results indicate that our approach stands out among generative-based models, while also showcasing remarkable robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these datasets often contain inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input prompts.

A major issue encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated pseudo-CT versus the true CT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and not the final version of this paper</p></details> | None |

Image enhancement is a crucial preprocessing stage in the image-processing chain, improving image quality and emphasizing features. This makes subsequent tasks (segmentation, feature extraction, classification) more reliable. Image enhancement is essential for rice leaf analysis, aiding in disease detection, nutrient deficiency evaluation, and growth analysis. Denoising followed by contrast enhancement are the primary steps. Image filters, generally employed for denoising, transform or enhance visual characteristics like brightness, contrast, and sharpness, playing a crucial role in improving overall image quality and enabling the extraction of useful information. This work provides an extensive comparative study of well-known image-denoising methods combined with CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for efficient denoising of rice leaf images. The experiments were performed on a rice leaf image dataset to ensure the data is relevant and representative. Results were examined using various metrics to comprehensively test enhancement methods.

Such optimization problems can often be reformulated as fixed-point problems for certain operators, which are then solved using iterative methods based on the same operator, including the KM iteration, to ultimately obtain the solution to the original optimization problem. Prior to developing TKMA, we first introduce a KM iteration enhanced with adaptive momentum, derived from geometric properties of an averaged nonexpansive operator T, KM acceleration technique, and information from the composite operator T^2. The proposed TKMA is constructed as a convex combination of this adaptive-momentum KM iteration and the Picard iteration of T^2. We establish the convergence of the sequence generated by TKMA to a fixed point of T. Moreover, under specific assumptions on the adaptive momentum parameters, we prove that the algorithm achieves an o(1/k^{1/2}) convergence rate in terms of the distance between successive iterates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TKMA outperforms the FPPA, PGA, Fast KM algorithm, and Halpern algorithm on tasks such as image denoising and low-rank matrix completion.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures | None |

However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.</p></details> |  | None |

Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

Recent advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.Project page: https://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures | [Code Link](https://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen) |

In visual text rendering, accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, greatly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment.

Unfortunately, these models may be unable to represent any particular image because of architectural choices, mode collapse, and bias in the training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that invertible neural networks, which have zero representation error by design, can be effective natural signal priors at inverse problems such as denoising, compressive sensing, and inpainting. Given a trained generative model, we study the empirical risk formulation of the desired inverse problem under a regularization that promotes high likelihood images, either directly by penalization or algorithmically by initialization. For compressive sensing, invertible priors can yield higher accuracy than sparsity priors across almost all undersampling ratios, and due to their lack of representation error, invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than GAN priors for images that have rare features of variation within the biased training set, including out-of-distribution natural images. We additionally compare performance for compressive sensing to unlearned methods, such as the deep decoder, and we establish theoretical bounds on expected recovery error in the case of a linear invertible model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version for ICML 2020, paper 2655</p></details> | None |

Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions.

Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

| **[Towards General Modality Translation with Contrastive and Predictive Latent Diffusion Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20819v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT), translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis. Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

| **[Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^α$ curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz exponent $α\leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the minimax asymptotic bounds for all $α$. Wavelet scattering coefficients have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients. We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents $α\leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture. It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with deep convolutional network.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-Free Safe Denoisers for Safe Use of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08011v5)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing concern over the safety of powerful diffusion models (DMs), as they are often misused to produce inappropriate, not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content or generate copyrighted material or data of individuals who wish to be forgotten. Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.</p></details> | NeurIPS2025 | None |
| **[RestoreVAR: Visual Autoregressive Generation for All-in-One Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18047v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as Stable Diffusion has significantly improved the perceptual quality of All-in-One image Restoration (AiOR) methods, while also enhancing their generalization capabilities. However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach for image generation, performs scale-space autoregression and achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. Moreover, our analysis reveals that coarse scales in VAR primarily capture degradations while finer scales encode scene detail, simplifying the restoration process. Motivated by this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel VAR-based generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $10\times$ faster inference. To optimally exploit the advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/restorevarpage/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sudraj2002.github.io/restorevarpage) |

In contrast, deep learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method, termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.</p></details> |  | None |

Synthetic data offers a scalable, privacy-preserving solution. We evaluated the feasibility of generating realistic lateral cervical spine radiographs using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) trained on 4,963 images from the Cervical Spine X-ray Atlas. Model performance was monitored via training/validation loss and Frechet inception distance, and synthetic image quality was assessed in a blinded "clinical Turing test" with six neuroradiologists and two spine-fellowship trained neurosurgeons. Experts reviewed 50 quartets containing one real and three synthetic images, identifying the real image and rating realism on a 4-point Likert scale. Experts correctly identified the real image in 29% of trials (Fleiss' kappa=0.061). Mean realism scores were comparable between real (3.323) and synthetic images (3.228, 3.258, and 3.320; p=0.383, 0.471, 1.000). Nearest-neighbor analysis found no evidence of memorization. We also provide a dataset of 20,063 synthetic radiographs. These results demonstrate that DDPM-generated cervical spine X-rays are statistically indistinguishable in realism and quality from real clinical images, offering a novel approach to creating large-scale neuroimaging datasets for ML applications in landmarking, segmentation, and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |
| **[Proximal Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22252v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian formulation of modern day signal processing problems has called for improved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms for inference. The need for efficient sampling techniques has become indispensable for high dimensional distributions that often characterize many core signal processing problems, e.g., image denoising, sparse signal recovery, etc. A major issue in building effective sampling strategies, however, is the non-differentiability of the underlying posterior density. Such posteriors are popular in models designed to recover sparse signals. As a result, the use of efficient gradient-based MCMC sampling techniques becomes difficult. We circumvent this problem by proposing a Proximal Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (p-HMC) algorithm, which leverages elements from convex optimization like proximal mappings and Moreau-Yosida (MY) envelopes within Hamiltonian dynamics. Our method improves upon the current state of the art non-smooth Hamiltonian Monte Carlo as it achieves a relatively sharper approximation of the gradient of log posterior density and a computational burden of at most the current state-of-the-art. A chief contribution of this work is the theoretical analysis of p-HMC. We provide conditions for geometric ergodicity of the underlying HMC chain. On the practical front, we propose guidance on choosing the key p-HMC hyperparameter -- the regularization parameter in the MY-envelope. We demonstrate p-HMC's efficiency over other MCMC algorithms on benchmark problems of logistic regression and low-rank matrix estimation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Contrastive Conditional-Unconditional Alignment for Long-tailed Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, we aim to improve the diversity and fidelity of tail class images without compromising the quality of head class images. We achieve this by introducing two simple but highly effective loss functions. Firstly, we employ an Unsupervised Contrastive Loss (UCL) utilizing negative samples to increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images. Such regularization is coupled with a standard trick of batch resampling to further diversify tail-class images. Our second loss is an Alignment Loss (AL) that aligns class-conditional generation with unconditional generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. We successfully leverage contrastive learning and conditional-unconditional alignment for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our framework is easy to implement as demonstrated on both U-Net based architecture and Diffusion Transformer. Our method outperforms vanilla denoising diffusion probabilistic models, score-based diffusion model, and alternative methods for class-imbalanced image generation across various datasets, in particular ImageNet-LT with 256x256 resolution.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures | None |

While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE). Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figure, 2 tables, accepted at Neurips 2025</p></details> | None |

However, generating multiple videos with consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images. Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training, offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without relying on reference images or additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wolfball.github.io/bachvid</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wolfball.github.io/bachvid) |

However, most inference-time scaling methods rely on fixed denoising schedules, limiting their ability to allocate computation based on instance difficulty or task-specific demands adaptively. We introduce the challenge of adaptive inference-time scaling-dynamically adjusting computational effort during inference-and propose Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD), a flexible, search-based inference framework. ABCD refines outputs through bi-directional diffusion cycles while adaptively controlling exploration depth and termination. It comprises three components: Cyclic Diffusion Search, Automatic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing, and Adaptive Thinking Time.

| **[BADiff: Bandwidth Adaptive Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21366v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios, limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.

However, this presents an inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process, while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and, particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly improving robustness and stability.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized} energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective, ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64 dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: log probabilities estimated with two networks trained on non-overlapping data subsets are nearly identical. Finally, we demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local neighborhoods vary substantially depending on image content, in contrast with conventional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a low-dimensional manifold.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/ (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail preservation.

Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet the PFCM can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT). The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and can be applied to the field of generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |
| **[Graph Representation Learning with Diffusion Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13133v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established themselves as state-of-the-art generative models across various data modalities, including images and videos, due to their ability to accurately approximate complex data distributions. Unlike traditional generative approaches such as VAEs and GANs, diffusion models employ a progressive denoising process that transforms noise into meaningful data over multiple iterative steps. This gradual approach enhances their expressiveness and generation quality. Not only that, diffusion models have also been shown to extract meaningful representations from data while learning to generate samples. Despite their success, the application of diffusion models to graph-structured data remains relatively unexplored, primarily due to the discrete nature of graphs, which necessitates discrete diffusion processes distinct from the continuous methods used in other domains. In this work, we leverage the representational capabilities of diffusion models to learn meaningful embeddings for graph data. By training a discrete diffusion model within an autoencoder framework, we enable both effective autoencoding and representation learning tailored to the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. We extract the representation from the combination of the encoder's output and the decoder's first time step hidden embedding. Our approach demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models to be used for graph representation learning.

Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps; consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM (21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58), without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable to leading continuous generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025.
