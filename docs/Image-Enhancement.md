The world model leverages action and visual inputs to predict future image states, learning the underlying physics of the environment to refine action generation. Conversely, the VLA model produces subsequent actions from image observations, enhancing visual understanding and supporting the world model's image generation. The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Planning with Sketch-Guided Verification for Physics-Aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17450v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: https://sketchverify.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sparse Mixture-of-Experts for Multi-Channel Imaging: Are All Channel Interactions Required?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17400v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: "Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This has been accepted at the NeurIPS AI4Science Workshop 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[UAM: A Unified Attention-Mamba Backbone of Multimodal Framework for Tumor Cell Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17355v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained insights into tumor phenotypes and have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches). These findings highlight the effectiveness and promise of UAM as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NoPe-NeRF++: Local-to-Global Optimization of NeRF with No Pose Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17322v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce NoPe-NeRF++, a novel local-to-global optimization algorithm for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without requiring pose priors. Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance and robustness, even in challenging scenes, thus validating our design choices.</p></details> |  | None |

To counteract these issues, two self-supervised deep learning methods for denoising of raw detector data were investigated and compared against a non-learning based denoising method. We found that the application of the deep-learning-based methods was able to enhance signal-to-noise ratios in the detector data and also led to consistent improvements of the reconstructed images, outperforming the non-learning based method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SpatialGeo:Boosting Spatial Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs via Geometry-Semantics Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17308v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

| **[BiFingerPose: Bimodal Finger Pose Estimation for Touch Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17306v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finger pose offers promising opportunities to expand human computer interaction capability of touchscreen devices. Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority. Finally, we delineate the application space of finger pose with respect to enhancing authentication security and improving interactive experiences, and develop corresponding prototypes to showcase the interaction potential. Our code will be available at https://github.com/XiongjunGuan/DualFingerPose.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/XiongjunGuan/DualFingerPose) |
| **[MolSight: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition with SMILES Pretraining, Multi-Granularity Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17300v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Where Culture Fades: Revealing the Cultural Gap in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17282v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-domain Adaptation Networks for Realistic Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17217v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

| **[Real Noise Decoupling for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17196v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EatGAN: An Edge-Attention Guided Generative Adversarial Network for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-image super-resolution (SISR) is an important task in image processing, aiming to enhance the resolution of imaging systems. Recently, SISR has made a significant leap and achieved promising results with deep learning. GAN-based models stand out among all the deep learning models because of their excellent performance in perceiving quality. However, it is rather difficult for them to reconstruct realistic high-frequency details and achieve stable training. To solve these issues, we introduce an Edge-Attention guided Generative Adversarial Network (EatGAN), the first GAN-based SISR model that simultaneously leverages edge priors both explicitly and implicitly inside the generator, which (i) proposes a Normalized Edge Attention (NEA) mechanism based on channel-affine and spatial gating that transforms edge prior into lightweight, learnable modulation parameters and injects and fuses them multiple times in a (ii) edge-guided hybrid residual block, which progressively enforces structural consistency across scales; and (iii) a composite generator objective combining pixel, perceptual, edge-gradient, and adversarial terms. Experiments show consistent state-of-the-art across distortion-oriented benchmarks and perception oriented benchmarks. Notably, our model achieves 40.87 dB and 0.073 (LPIPS) on Manga 109, which indicates that reframing image priors from passive guidance into a controllable modulation primitive for generators can chart a practical path toward trustworthy, high-fidelity Super-Resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (8 pages of main text + 3 pages of reference + 6 pages of supplementary material)</p></details> | None |
| **[Navigating in the Dark: A Multimodal Framework and Dataset for Nighttime Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17183v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signboards are vital for road safety and intelligent transportation systems, enabling navigation and autonomous driving. Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional LIC suffers from severe artifacts due to heavy quantization, while generative VQ modeling gives poor fidelity due to the mismatch between learned generative priors and specific inputs. In this work, we propose Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression (HDCompression), a dual-stream framework that utilizes both generative VQ-modeling and diffusion models, as well as conventional LIC, to achieve both high fidelity and high perceptual quality. Different from previous hybrid methods that directly use pre-trained LIC models to generate low-quality fidelity-preserving information from heavily quantized latent, we use diffusion models to extract high-quality complementary fidelity information from the ground-truth input, which can enhance the system performance in several aspects: improving index map prediction, enhancing the fidelity-preserving output of the LIC stream, and refining conditioned image reconstruction with VQ-latent correction. In addition, our diffusion model is based on a dense representative vector (DRV), which is lightweight with very simple sampling schedulers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDCompression outperforms the previous conventional LIC, generative VQ-modeling, and hybrid frameworks in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization, providing balanced robust compression performance at ultra-low bitrates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PRICAI 2025 (Oral Presentation)</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.</p></details> | none | None |
| **[One-Step Diffusion Transformer for Controllable Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17138v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the "affective gap", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the "affective gap". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that bridging the "affective gap" significantly improves the performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks.

However, achieving both high-fidelity textured surface reconstruction and dynamic generation for articulated objects remains challenging for existing methods. In this paper, we present REArtGS, a novel framework that introduces additional geometric and motion constraints to 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling realistic surface reconstruction and generation for articulated objects. Specifically, given multi-view RGB images of arbitrary two states of articulated objects, we first introduce an unbiased Signed Distance Field (SDF) guidance to regularize Gaussian opacity fields, enhancing geometry constraints and improving surface reconstruction quality. Then we establish deformable fields for 3D Gaussians constrained by the kinematic structures of articulated objects, achieving unsupervised generation of surface meshes in unseen states. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our approach achieves high-quality textured surface reconstruction for given states, and enables high-fidelity surface generation for unseen states.

| **[Loss-Oriented Ranking for Automated Visual Prompting in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16112v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image. However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To train AutoV, we develop an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various visual prompts for LVLMs. Experiments indicate that AutoV enhances the performance of various LVLMs across multiple image understanding tasks. For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{10.2}\%$ accuracy gain on VizWiz, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{3.8}\%$ on MMMU, highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method.</p></details> | 17 pages | None |
| **[Aligning Vision to Language: Annotation-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models.

However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences.

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

We propose CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters, enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MMAsia 2025</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures,aaai2026</p></details> | None |

The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based multi-temporal-resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-temporal-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding the optical flow being dominated by head movements. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, we use the proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) operation and convolutional layers to extract multi-scale spatio-temporal features. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design instructions for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Noted...</summary><p>Noted that This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material</p></details> | None |

However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models including a Vision Transformer under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high accuracy (96-98%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V2 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations in this study confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/kiranshahi/pneumonia-analysis</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/kiranshahi/pneumonia-analysis) |

While state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods excel at synthesizing photorealistic novel views through rasterization-based rendering, their reliance on sparse, explicit primitives severely limits their ability to recover watertight and topologically consistent 3D surfaces.We introduce MonoGSDF, a novel method that couples Gaussian-based primitives with a neural Signed Distance Field (SDF) for high-quality reconstruction. During training, the SDF guides Gaussians' spatial distribution, while at inference, Gaussians serve as priors to reconstruct surfaces, eliminating the need for memory-intensive Marching Cubes. To handle arbitrary-scale scenes, we propose a scaling strategy for robust generalization. A multi-resolution training scheme further refines details and monocular geometric cues from off-the-shelf estimators enhance reconstruction quality. Experiments on real-world datasets show MonoGSDF outperforms prior methods while maintaining efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation.

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |

The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |

Historically, optimization-based registration models have harnessed spatially varying regularization to address anatomical subtleties. However, most modern deep learning-based models tend to gravitate towards spatially invariant regularization, wherein a homogenous regularization strength is applied across the entire image, potentially disregarding localized variations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that integrates a prior distribution on the deformation regularization strength, enabling the end-to-end learning of a spatially varying deformation regularizer directly from the data. The proposed method is straightforward to implement and easily integrates with various registration network architectures. Additionally, automatic tuning of hyperparameters is achieved through Bayesian optimization, allowing efficient identification of optimal hyperparameters for any given registration task. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves registration performance and enhances the interpretability of deep learning-based registration, all while maintaining smooth deformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Medical Image Analysis ((c) MedIA).

Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios.

Existing methods often struggle due to insufficient background priors and limited generative capability, both of which are highly important under such conditions. In this paper, we introduce BeyondHaze, a generative nighttime dehazing method that not only reduces haze and glow effects but also reconstructs plausible background structures in regions where visual cues are heavily degraded. Our approach is built on two main ideas: obtaining strong background priors by adapting image diffusion models to nighttime dehazing, and enhancing generative ability in haze- and glow-obscured areas through guided training. Task-specific nighttime dehazing knowledge is distilled into an image diffusion model while preserving its capacity to generate clean images. The diffusion model is further trained on tailored image pairs to improve its ability to recover background details that are suppressed by haze effects. Since generative models may introduce hallucinated content, we design our framework to allow user control over the generative level, enabling a balance between visual realism and fidelity.

However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component.

| **[Enhancing Visual Feature Attribution via Weighted Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03201v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely used attribution method in explainable AI, particularly in computer vision applications where reliable feature attribution is essential. A key limitation of IG is its sensitivity to the choice of baseline (reference) images. Multi-baseline extensions such as Expected Gradients (EG) assume uniform weighting over baselines, implicitly treating baseline images as equally informative. In high-dimensional vision models, this assumption often leads to noisy or unstable explanations. This paper proposes Weighted Integrated Gradients (WG), a principled approach that evaluates and weights baselines to enhance attribution reliability. WG introduces an unsupervised criterion for baseline suitability, enabling adaptive selection and weighting of baselines on a per-input basis. The method not only preserves core axiomatic properties of IG but also provides improved theoretical guarantees on the quality of explanation over EG. Experiments on commonly used image datasets and models show that WG consistently outperforms EG, yielding 10 to 35 percent improvements in attribution fidelity. WG further identifies informative baseline subsets, reducing unnecessary variability while maintaining high attribution accuracy. By moving beyond the idea that all baselines matter equally, Weighted Integrated Gradients offers a clearer and more reliable way to explain computer-vision models, improving both understanding and practical usability in explainable AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing efficiency in paediatric brain tumour segmentation using a pathologically diverse single-center clinical dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22152v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children, encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG, medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT), T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2 alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>A.

| **[LSAP: Rethinking Inversion Fidelity, Perception and Editability in GAN Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12746v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As research on image inversion advances, the process is generally divided into two stages. The first step is Image Embedding, involves using an encoder or optimization procedure to embed an image and obtain its corresponding latent code. The second stage, referred to as Result Refinement, further improves the inversion and editing outcomes. Although this refinement stage substantially enhances reconstruction fidelity, perception and editability remain largely unchanged and are highly dependent on the latent codes derived from the first stage. Therefore, a key challenge lies in obtaining latent codes that preserve reconstruction fidelity while simultaneously improving perception and editability. In this work, we first reveal that these two properties are closely related to the degree of alignment (or disalignment) between the inverted latent codes and the synthetic distribution. Based on this insight, we propose the \textbf{ Latent Space Alignment Inversion Paradigm (LSAP)}, which integrates both an evaluation metric and a unified inversion solution. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{Normalized Style Space ($\mathcal{S^N}$ space)} and \textbf{Normalized Style Space Cosine Distance (NSCD)} to quantify the disalignment of inversion methods. Moreover, our paradigm can be optimized for both encoder-based and optimization-based embeddings, providing a consistent alignment framework. Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that NSCD effectively captures perceptual and editable characteristics, and that our alignment paradigm achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stages of inversion.</p></details> | under review | None |
| **[Layer-wise Noise Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16162v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

| **[A Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception Attention for Remote Sensing Water Body Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16143v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP) |

Recent methods are primarily built on UNet-based diffusion models, which have improved scene text editing results, but still struggle with complex glyph structures, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese, Korean, Japanese). To address these issues, we present \textbf{FLUX-Text}, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing DiT method. Specifically, our FLUX-Text enhances glyph understanding and generation through lightweight Visual and Text Embedding Modules, while preserving the original generative capability of FLUX. We further propose a Regional Text Perceptual Loss tailored for text regions, along with a matching two-stage training strategy to better balance text editing and overall image quality. Benefiting from the DiT-based architecture and lightweight feature injection modules, FLUX-Text can be trained with only $0.1$M training examples, a \textbf{97\%} reduction compared to $2.9$M required by popular methods.

Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (CMIG)</p></details> | None |
| **[Medverse: A Universal Model for Full-Resolution 3D Medical Image Segmentation, Transformation and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09232v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities. Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and model weights will be made publicly available.

However, the real-world robustness of these defenses against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Faceted Attack (MFA), a framework that systematically exposes general safety vulnerabilities in leading defense-equipped VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-4. The core component of MFA is the Attention-Transfer Attack (ATA), which hides harmful instructions inside a meta task with competing objectives. We provide a theoretical perspective based on reward hacking to explain why this attack succeeds. To improve cross-model transferability, we further introduce a lightweight transfer-enhancement algorithm combined with a simple repetition strategy that jointly bypasses both input-level and output-level filters without model-specific fine-tuning. Empirically, we show that adversarial images optimized for one vision encoder transfer broadly to unseen VLMs, indicating that shared visual representations create a cross-model safety vulnerability. Overall, MFA achieves a 58.5% success rate and consistently outperforms existing methods. On state-of-the-art commercial models, MFA reaches a 52.8% success rate, surpassing the second-best attack by 34%. These results challenge the perceived robustness of current defense mechanisms and highlight persistent safety weaknesses in modern VLMs. Code: https://github.com/cure-lab/MultiFacetedAttack</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral | [Code Link](https://github.com/cure-lab/MultiFacetedAttack) |

Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar.

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

However, current state-of-the-art video models still lag behind image models in visual quality and user control over generated content. In this paper, we introduce TokenWarping, a novel framework for temporally coherent video translation. Existing diffusion-based video editing approaches rely solely on key and value patches in self-attention to ensure temporal consistency, often sacrificing the preservation of local and structural regions. Critically, these methods overlook the significance of the query patches in achieving accurate feature aggregation and temporal coherence. In contrast, TokenWarping leverages complementary token priors by constructing temporal correlations across different frames. Our method begins by extracting optical flows from source videos. During the denoising process of the diffusion model, these optical flows are used to warp the previous frame's query, key, and value patches, aligning them with the current frame's patches. By directly warping the query patches, we enhance feature aggregation in self-attention, while warping the key and value patches ensures temporal consistency across frames. This token warping imposes explicit constraints on the self-attention layer outputs, effectively ensuring temporally coherent translation. Our framework does not require any additional training or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated with existing text-to-image editing methods. We conduct extensive experiments on various video translation tasks, demonstrating that TokenWarping surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

Most existing methods, which rely on extending single images, face notable computational challenges in maintaining cross-view consistency and generating high-resolution outputs. To address these issues, we propose the Geometry-guided Multi-View Diffusion Model, which incorporates mechanisms for extracting multi-view geometric information and adjusting the intensity of geometric features to generate images that are both consistent across views and rich in detail. Specifically, we design a multi-view geometry information extraction module that leverages depth maps, normal maps, and foreground segmentation masks to construct a shared geometric structure, ensuring shape and structural consistency across different views. To enhance consistency and detail restoration during generation, we develop a decoupled geometry-enhanced attention mechanism that strengthens feature focus on key geometric details, thereby improving overall image quality and detail preservation. Furthermore, we apply an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes the model to better capture spatial relationships and visual coherence between the generated views, ensuring realistic results. Our model also incorporates an iterative refinement process that progressively improves the output quality through multiple stages of image generation. Finally, a dynamic geometry information intensity adjustment mechanism is proposed to adaptively regulate the influence of geometric data, optimizing overall quality while ensuring the naturalness of generated images.

However, its performance on ultrasound images is significantly degraded due to domain disparities. This limitation raises two critical challenges: how to efficiently adapt SAM2 to ultrasound imaging while maintaining parameter efficiency, and how to deploy the adapted model effectively in resource-constrained clinical environments. To address these issues, we propose UniUltra for universal ultrasound segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel context-edge hybrid adapter (CH-Adapter) that enhances fine-grained perception across diverse ultrasound imaging modalities while achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To further improve clinical applicability, we develop a deep-supervised knowledge distillation (DSKD) technique that transfers knowledge from the large image encoder of the fine-tuned SAM2 to a super lightweight encoder, substantially reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUltra outperforms state-of-the-arts with superior generalization capabilities. Notably, our framework achieves competitive performance using only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning, and the final compressed model reduces the parameter count by 94.08% compared to the original SAM2, making it highly suitable for practical clinical deployment.

Moreover, our method operates in a patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of $512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and $4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than zero-shot methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we revisit the geolocalization task, which requires not only nuanced visual grounding but also web search to confirm or refine hypotheses during reasoning. Since existing geolocalization benchmarks fail to meet the need for high-resolution imagery and the localization challenge for deep agentic reasoning, we curate GeoBench, a benchmark that includes photos and panoramas from around the world, along with a subset of satellite images of different cities to rigorously evaluate the geolocalization ability of agentic models. We also propose GeoVista, an agentic model that seamlessly integrates tool invocation within the reasoning loop, including an image-zoom-in tool to magnify regions of interest and a web-search tool to retrieve related web information. We develop a complete training pipeline for it, including a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to learn reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to further enhance reasoning ability. We adopt a hierarchical reward to leverage multi-level geographical information and improve overall geolocalization performance. Experimental results show that GeoVista surpasses other open-source agentic models on the geolocalization task greatly and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5 on most metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

The architecture integrates 3D convolutional layers for local spectral-spatial feature extraction with two parallel MLP-style mixer blocks that capture long-range dependencies in spectral and spatial dimensions. A depthwise convolution-based attention mechanism is employed to enhance discriminative capability with minimal computational overhead. The model is evaluated on the QUH-Tangdaowan and QUH-Qingyun datasets using only 1% of labeled data for training and validation. SS-MixNet achieves the highest performance among compared methods, including 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN, IP-SWIN, SimPoolFormer, and HybridKAN, reaching 95.68% and 93.86% overall accuracy on the Tangdaowan and Qingyun datasets, respectively. The results, supported by quantitative metrics and classification maps, confirm the model's effectiveness in delivering accurate and robust predictions with limited supervision.

However, its clinical application remains limited by tissue decorrelation noise, scarcity of ground truth, and inconsistent strain estimation under different deformation conditions. Overcoming these barriers, we propose MUSSE-Net, a residual-aware, multi-stage unsupervised sequential deep learning framework designed for robust and consistent strain estimation. At its backbone lies our proposed USSE-Net, an end-to-end multi-stream encoder-decoder architecture that parallelly processes pre- and post-deformation RF sequences to estimate displacement fields and axial strains. The novel architecture incorporates Context-Aware Complementary Feature Fusion (CACFF)-based encoder with Tri-Cross Attention (TCA) bottleneck with a Cross-Attentive Fusion (CAF)-based sequential decoder. To ensure temporal coherence and strain stability across varying deformation levels, this architecture leverages a tailored consistency loss. Finally, with the MUSSE-Net framework, a secondary residual refinement stage further enhances accuracy and suppresses noise. Extensive validation on simulation, in vivo, and private clinical datasets from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) medical center, demonstrates MUSSE-Net's outperformed existing unsupervised approaches. On MUSSE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with a target SNR of 24.54, background SNR of 132.76, CNR of 59.81, and elastographic SNR of 9.73 on simulation data. In particular, on the BUET dataset, MUSSE-Net produces strain maps with enhanced lesion-to-background contrast and significant noise suppression yielding clinically interpretable strain patterns.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Interpretable Retinal Disease Prediction Using Biology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16697v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability is crucial to enhance trust in machine learning models for medical diagnostics. However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on neural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to known biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification typically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p></details> |  | None |

In view of antiforensics, it is significant to develop advanced adversarial attacks for evaluating the security of such detectors, which remains unexplored sufficiently. This letter proposes a Dual-domain Feature Importance Attack (DuFIA) scheme to invalidate AIGI detectors to some extent. Forensically important features are captured by the spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation. The adversarial transferability is enhanced by jointly modeling spatial and frequency-domain feature importances, which are fused to guide the optimization-based adversarial example generation. Extensive experiments across various AIGI detectors verify the cross-model transferability, transparency and robustness of DuFIA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Text Guided Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15515v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent CLIP-based few-shot semantic segmentation methods introduce class-level textual priors to assist segmentation by typically using a single prompt (e.g., a photo of class). However, these approaches often result in incomplete activation of target regions, as a single textual description cannot fully capture the semantic diversity of complex categories. Moreover, they lack explicit cross-modal interaction and are vulnerable to noisy support features, further degrading visual prior quality. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Text Guided Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation Network (MTGNet), a dual-branch framework that enhances segmentation performance by fusing diverse textual prompts to refine textual priors and guide the cross-modal optimization of visual priors. Specifically, we design a Multi-Textual Prior Refinement (MTPR) module that suppresses interference and aggregates complementary semantic cues to enhance foreground activation and expand semantic coverage for structurally complex objects. We introduce a Text Anchor Feature Fusion (TAFF) module, which leverages multi-text embeddings as semantic anchors to facilitate the transfer of discriminative local prototypes from support images to query images, thereby improving semantic consistency and alleviating intra-class variations. Furthermore, a Foreground Confidence-Weighted Attention (FCWA) module is presented to enhance visual prior robustness by leveraging internal self-similarity within support foreground features. It adaptively down-weights inconsistent regions and effectively suppresses interference in the query segmentation process. Extensive experiments on standard FSS benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MTGNet. In the 1-shot setting, it achieves 76.8% mIoU on PASCAL-5i and 57.4% on COCO-20i, with notable improvements in folds exhibiting high intra-class variations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Standardising the NLP Workflow: A Framework for Reproducible Linguistic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15512v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of large language models and other influential developments in AI-based language processing have led to an evolution in the methods available to quantitatively analyse language data. With the resultant growth of attention on language processing, significant challenges have emerged, including the lack of standardisation in organising and sharing linguistic data and the absence of standardised and reproducible processing methodologies. Striving for future standardisation, we first propose the Language Processing Data Structure (LPDS), a data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a widely adopted standard for handling neuroscience data. It provides a folder structure and file naming conventions for linguistic research. Second, we introduce pelican nlp, a modular and extensible Python package designed to enable streamlined language processing, from initial data cleaning and task-specific preprocessing to the extraction of sophisticated linguistic and acoustic features, such as semantic embeddings and prosodic metrics. The entire processing workflow can be specified within a single, shareable configuration file, which pelican nlp then executes on LPDS-formatted data. Depending on the specifications, the reproducible output can consist of preprocessed language data or standardised extraction of both linguistic and acoustic features and corresponding result aggregations. LPDS and pelican nlp collectively offer an end-to-end processing pipeline for linguistic data, designed to ensure methodological transparency and enhance reproducibility.</p></details> | 26 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, existing approaches often suffer from inefficiency, either due to token-by-token decoding or the complexity of multi-scale representations. In this work, we introduce Expanding Autoregressive Representation (EAR), a novel generation paradigm that emulates the human visual system's center-outward perception pattern. EAR unfolds image tokens in a spiral order from the center and progressively expands outward, preserving spatial continuity and enabling efficient parallel decoding. To further enhance flexibility and speed, we propose a length-adaptive decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens predicted at each step. This biologically inspired design not only reduces computational cost but also improves generation quality by aligning the generation order with perceptual relevance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that EAR achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency on single-scale autoregressive models, setting a new direction for scalable and cognitively aligned autoregressive image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, includes appendix with additional visualizations, submitted as arXiv preprint</p></details> | None |

Mainstream ADFMs rely on end-to-end learning and heavily synthesized datasets to achieve degradation awareness and fusion. This rough learning strategy and non-real world scenario dataset dependence often limit their upper-bound performance, leading to low-quality results. To address these limitations, we present LURE, a Learning-driven Unified REpresentation model for infrared and visible image fusion, which is degradation-aware. LURE learns a Unified Latent Feature Space (ULFS) to avoid the dependency on complex data formats inherent in previous end-to-end learning pipelines. It further improves image fusion quality by leveraging the intrinsic relationships between multi-modalities. A novel loss function is also proposed to drive the learning of unified latent representations more stable.More importantly, LURE seamlessly incorporates existing high-quality real-world image restoration datasets. To further enhance the model's representation capability, we design a simple yet effective structure, termed internal residual block, to facilitate the learning of latent features. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across general fusion, degradation-aware fusion, and downstream tasks.

| **[Evaluating Low-Light Image Enhancement Across Multiple Intensity Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15496v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging in low-light environments is challenging due to reduced scene radiance, which leads to elevated sensor noise and reduced color saturation. Most learning-based low-light enhancement methods rely on paired training data captured under a single low-light condition and a well-lit reference. The lack of radiance diversity limits our understanding of how enhancement techniques perform across varying illumination intensities. We introduce the Multi-Illumination Low-Light (MILL) dataset, containing images captured at diverse light intensities under controlled conditions with fixed camera settings and precise illuminance measurements. MILL enables comprehensive evaluation of enhancement algorithms across variable lighting conditions. We benchmark several state-of-the-art methods and reveal significant performance variations across intensity levels. Leveraging the unique multi-illumination structure of our dataset, we propose improvements that enhance robustness across diverse illumination scenarios. Our modifications achieve up to 10 dB PSNR improvement for DSLR and 2 dB for the smartphone on Full HD images.</p></details> |  | None |

A key step is the quality inspection of disassembled components, which is mostly done manually due to the high variety of parts and defect patterns. Deep neural networks show great potential to automate such visual inspection tasks but struggle to generalize to new product variants, components, or defect patterns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel image dataset depicting typical gearbox components in good and defective condition from two automotive transmissions. Depending on the train-test split of the data, different distribution shifts are generated to benchmark the generalization ability of a classification model. We evaluate different models using the dataset and propose a contrastive regularization loss to enhance model robustness. The results obtained demonstrate the ability of the loss to improve generalisation to unseen types of components.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HV-Attack: Hierarchical Visual Attack for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15435v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

This dataset addresses a critical gap between conventional urban driving resources and the unique operational scenarios encountered by unmanned systems in hazardous and damaged war-zones. We detail the methodological challenges encountered, ranging from data heterogeneity to ethical considerations, providing guidance for future efforts that target extreme operational contexts. To establish performance references, we report baseline results on WarNav using several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models trained on structured urban scenes. We further analyse the impact of training data environments and propose a first step towards effective navigability in challenging environments with the constraint of having no annotation of the targeted images. Our goal is to foster impactful research that enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles in high-risk scenarios while being frugal in annotated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CAID (Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Defence)</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. Furthermore, the absence of negative labels semantically similar to ID labels constrains their capability in near-OOD detection. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we cache images likely to be OOD samples from the historical test images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we cache the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to historical test images and then leverage MLLM reasoning to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD), making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 3.1\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.</p></details> |  | None |

While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically address this task through direct regression or feature alignment in a shared bird's-eye view (BEV) space. Although effective for coarse alignment, these methods fail to establish fine-grained and geometrically reliable correspondences under large viewpoint variations, thereby limiting both the accuracy and interpretability of localization results. Consequently, we revisit cross-view localization from the perspective of image matching and propose a unified framework that enhances both matching and localization. Specifically, we introduce a Surface Model that constrains BEV feature projection to physically valid regions for geometric consistency, and a SimRefiner that adaptively refines similarity distributions to enhance match reliability. To further support research in this area, we present CVFM, the first benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves geometry-consistent and fine-grained correspondences across extreme viewpoints and further improves the accuracy and stability of cross-view localization.</p></details> |  | None |

While previous studies focused on aligning visual and language features, exploring training techniques, such as data augmentation, remains underexplored. In this work, we explore effective data augmentation for RIS and propose a novel training framework called Masked Referring Image Segmentation (MaskRIS). We observe that the conventional image augmentations fall short of RIS, leading to performance degradation, while simple random masking significantly enhances the performance of RIS. MaskRIS uses both image and text masking, followed by Distortion-aware Contextual Learning (DCL) to fully exploit the benefits of the masking strategy. This approach can improve the model's robustness to occlusions, incomplete information, and various linguistic complexities, resulting in a significant performance improvement. Experiments demonstrate that MaskRIS can easily be applied to various RIS models, outperforming existing methods in both fully supervised and weakly supervised settings.

With its near-real-time availability, STEREO/HI beacon data is the perfect candidate for early forecasting of CMEs. However, previous work concluded that CME arrival prediction based on beacon data could not achieve the same accuracy as with high-resolution science data due to data gaps and lower quality. We present our novel machine-learning pipeline entitled ``Beacon2Science'', bridging the gap between beacon and science data to improve CME tracking. Through this pipeline, we first enhance the quality (signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution) of beacon data. We then increase the time resolution of enhanced beacon images through learned interpolation to match science data's 40-minute resolution. We maximize information coherence between consecutive frames with adapted model architecture and loss functions through the different steps. The improved beacon images are comparable to science data, showing better CME visibility than the original beacon data. Furthermore, we compare CMEs tracked in beacon, enhanced beacon, and science images. The tracks extracted from enhanced beacon data are closer to those from science images, with a mean average error of $\sim 0.5 ^\circ$ of elongation compared to $1^\circ$ with original beacon data.

To address data insufficiency, X-ray security image synthesis methods composite images to scale up datasets. However, previous methods primarily follow a two-stage pipeline, where they implement labor-intensive foreground extraction in the first stage and then composite images in the second stage. Such a pipeline introduces inevitable extra labor cost and is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a one-stage X-ray security image synthesis pipeline (Xsyn) based on text-to-image generation, which incorporates two effective strategies to improve the usability of synthetic images. The Cross-Attention Refinement (CAR) strategy leverages the cross-attention map from the diffusion model to refine the bounding box annotation. The Background Occlusion Modeling (BOM) strategy explicitly models background occlusion in the latent space to enhance imaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, compared with previous methods, Xsyn is the first to achieve high-quality X-ray security image synthesis without extra labor cost. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all previous methods with 1.2% mAP improvement, and the synthetic images generated by our method are beneficial to improve prohibited item detection performance across various X-ray security datasets and detectors.

Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, existing research and evaluation standards predominantly focus on image realism and shallow text-image alignment, lacking a comprehensive assessment of complex semantic understanding and world knowledge integration in text-to-image generation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{WISE}, the first benchmark specifically designed for \textbf{W}orld Knowledge-\textbf{I}nformed \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{E}valuation. WISE moves beyond simple word-pixel mapping by challenging models with 1000 meticulously crafted prompts across 25 subdomains in cultural common sense, spatio-temporal reasoning, and natural science. To overcome the limitations of traditional CLIP metric, we introduce \textbf{WiScore}, a novel quantitative metric for assessing knowledge-image alignment. Through comprehensive testing of 20 models (10 dedicated T2I models and 10 unified multimodal models) using 1,000 structured prompts spanning 25 subdomains, our findings reveal significant limitations in their ability to effectively integrate and apply world knowledge during image generation, highlighting critical pathways for enhancing knowledge incorporation and application in next-generation T2I models.

Complex visual imagery, as proposed in our work, involves the user engaging in the mental visualization of complex upper limb movements. This innovative approach significantly enhances the BCI system, facilitating the extension of its applications to more sophisticated tasks such as EEG-based robotic arm control. By leveraging this advanced form of visual imagery, our study opens new horizons for intricate and intuitive mind-controlled interfaces. We developed an advanced deep learning architecture that integrates functional connectivity metrics with a convolutional neural network-image transformer. This framework is adept at decoding subtle user intentions, addressing the spatial variability in complex visual tasks, and effectively translating these into precise commands for robotic arm control. Our comprehensive offline and pseudo-online evaluations demonstrate the framework's efficacy in real-time applications, including the nuanced control of robotic arms. The robustness of our approach is further validated through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, marking a significant step towards versatile, subject-independent BCI applications.

Traditional methods, such as extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component, utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba, which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gene-DML: Dual-Pathway Multi-Level Discrimination for Gene Expression Prediction from Histopathology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14670v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However, existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene) instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening the alignment across modalities. By jointly modeling fine-grained and structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art performance in gene expression prediction.

| **[Unbiased Semantic Decoding with Vision Foundation Models for Few-shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15118v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot segmentation has garnered significant attention. Many recent approaches attempt to introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to handle this task. With the strong generalization ability and rich object-specific extraction ability of the SAM model, such a solution shows great potential in few-shot segmentation. However, the decoding process of SAM highly relies on accurate and explicit prompts, making previous approaches mainly focus on extracting prompts from the support set, which is insufficient to activate the generalization ability of SAM, and this design is easy to result in a biased decoding process when adapting to the unknown classes. In this work, we propose an Unbiased Semantic Decoding (USD) strategy integrated with SAM, which extracts target information from both the support and query set simultaneously to perform consistent predictions guided by the semantics of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. Specifically, to enhance the unbiased semantic discrimination of SAM, we design two feature enhancement strategies that leverage the semantic alignment capability of CLIP to enrich the original SAM features, mainly including a global supplement at the image level to provide a generalize category indicate with support image and a local guidance at the pixel level to provide a useful target location with query image. Besides, to generate target-focused prompt embeddings, a learnable visual-text target prompt generator is proposed by interacting target text embeddings and clip visual features. Without requiring re-training of the vision foundation models, the features with semantic discrimination draw attention to the target region through the guidance of prompt with rich target information.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing projection-based methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions. However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition, we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version needs major revision</p></details> | None |
| **[UNIV: Unified Foundation Model for Infrared and Visible Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15642v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint RGB-infrared perception is essential for achieving robustness under diverse weather and illumination conditions. Although foundation models excel within single modalities, they suffer from substantial cross-modal degradation, an issue we attribute to a pattern shortcut, i.e., a modal bias that prioritizes superficial sensor patterns over underlying semantics. To address this problem, we introduce UNIV, a Unified foundation model for Infrared and Visible modalities. At the core of UNIV lies Patch Cross-modal Contrastive Learning (PCCL), a self-supervised contrastive learning strategy that constructs a unified cross-modal feature space. PCCL employs a frozen pre-trained model to sample pseudo patch pairs based on semantic similarity, and aligns infrared-visible representations by attracting semantically related pairs while repelling unrelated ones. This process simultaneously enhances cross-modal alignment and inter-class semantic separability, guiding the model to focus on semantic structure rather than falling into pattern shortcuts. To further enable cross-modal learning, we introduce MVIP, the most comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date, containing 98,992 precisely aligned image pairs across diverse scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU for semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP for detection), while maintaining competitive accuracy on RGB tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BokehFlow: Depth-Free Controllable Bokeh Rendering via Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15066v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bokeh rendering simulates the shallow depth-of-field effect in photography, enhancing visual aesthetics and guiding viewer attention to regions of interest. Although recent approaches perform well, rendering controllable bokeh without additional depth inputs remains a significant challenge. Existing classical and neural controllable methods rely on accurate depth maps, while generative approaches often struggle with limited controllability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose BokehFlow, a depth-free framework for controllable bokeh rendering based on flow matching. BokehFlow directly synthesizes photorealistic bokeh effects from all-in-focus images, eliminating the need for depth inputs. It employs a cross-attention mechanism to enable semantic control over both focus regions and blur intensity via text prompts. To support training and evaluation, we collect and synthesize four datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BokehFlow achieves visually compelling bokeh effects and offers precise control, outperforming existing depth-dependent and generative methods in both rendering quality and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these issues, we introduce the Transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) regularizer applied to image gradients. In particular, we develop a TL1-regularized denoising model and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), featuring a closed-form TL1 proximal operator and an FFT-based image update under periodic boundary conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior denoising performance, effectively suppressing noise while preserving edges and enhancing image contrast.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hyperspectral Super-Resolution with Inter-Image Variability via Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15052v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) with multispectral image (MSI) provides an effective way to enhance the spatial resolution of HSI. However, due to different acquisition conditions, there may exist spectral variability and spatially localized changes between HSI and MSI, referred to as inter-image variability, which can significantly affect the fusion performance. Existing methods typically handle inter-image variability by applying direct transformations to the images themselves, which can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the fusion model. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion (DLRRF) model. First, we model the spectral variability as change in the spectral degradation operator. Second, to recover the lost spatial details caused by spatially localized changes, we decompose the target HSI into low rank and residual components, where the latter is used to capture the lost details. By exploiting the spectral correlation within the images, we perform dimensionality reduction on both components. Additionally, we introduce an implicit regularizer to utilize the spatial prior information from the images. The proposed DLRRF model is solved using the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm within a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, where the subproblem regarding implicit regularizer is addressed by an external denoiser. We further provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that DLRRF achieves superior performance in fusing HSI and MSI with inter-image variability.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose UniHOI, which jointly models HOI detection and generation via a unified token space, thereby effectively promoting knowledge sharing and enhancing generalization. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric interaction-aware attention module and a unified semi-supervised learning paradigm, enabling effective bidirectional mapping between images and interaction semantics even under limited annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in both HOI detection and generation. Specifically, UniHOI improves accuracy by 4.9% on long-tailed HOI detection and boosts interaction metrics by 42.0% on open-vocabulary generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026,9 pages, 4 figures</p></details> | None |

Low-dose CT (LDCT) helps mitigate radiation exposure but simultaneously leads to reduced image quality. Consequently, researchers have sought to reconstruct clear images from LDCT scans using artificial intelligence-based image enhancement techniques. However, these studies typically rely on synthetic LDCT images for algorithm training, which introduces significant domain-shift issues and limits the practical effectiveness of these algorithms in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we constructed a real-world paired lung dataset, referred to as Patient-uLDCT (ultra-low-dose CT), by performing multiple scans on volunteers. The radiation dose for the low-dose images in this dataset is only 2% of the normal dose, substantially lower than the conventional 25% low-dose and 10% ultra-low-dose levels. Furthermore, to resolve the anatomical misalignment between normal-dose and uLDCT images caused by respiratory motion during acquisition, we propose a novel purification strategy to construct corresponding aligned image pairs. Finally, we introduce a Frequency-domain Flow Matching model (FFM) that achieves excellent image reconstruction performance.

The framework comprises three core line-up of models: Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite - a line-up of 6B parameter image generation models, Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite - a fast and lightweight 2B parameter text-to-video and image-to-video models, and Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro - 19B parameter models that achieves superior video generation quality. We provide a comprehensive review of the data curation lifecycle - including collection, processing, filtering and clustering - for the multi-stage training pipeline that involves extensive pre-training and incorporates quality-enhancement techniques such as self-supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. We also present novel architectural, training, and inference optimizations that enable Kandinsky 5.0 to achieve high generation speeds and state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, as demonstrated by human evaluation. As a large-scale, publicly available generative framework, Kandinsky 5.0 leverages the full potential of its pre-training and subsequent stages to be adapted for a wide range of generative applications. We hope that this report, together with the release of our open-source code and training checkpoints, will substantially advance the development and accessibility of high-quality generative models for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://kandinskylab.ai/</p></details> | None |

Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and their implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potentials lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG functions, and spike encoding schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Continuum Dropout for Neural Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10446v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to enhance the method and benchmark to be better</p></details> | None |

In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 3 appendices</p></details> | None |

A critical example is 2D/3D registration, where small registration misalignments can lead to surgical errors. Current visualization strategies alone are insufficient to reliably enable humans to detect these misalignments, highlighting the need for enhanced decision-support tools. Methods: We propose the first artificial intelligence (AI) model tailored to 2D/3D registration quality assessment, augmented with explainable AI (XAI) mechanisms to clarify the model's predictions. Using both objective measures (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity) and subjective evaluations (e.g., workload, trust, and understanding), we systematically compare decision-making across four conditions: AI-only, Human-only, Human+AI, and Human+XAI. Results: The AI-only condition achieved the highest accuracy, whereas collaborative paradigms (Human+AI and Human+XAI) improved sensitivity, precision, and specificity compared to standalone approaches. Participants experienced significantly lower workload in collaborative conditions relative to the Human-only condition. Moreover, participants reported a greater understanding of AI predictions in the Human+XAI condition than in Human+AI, although no significant differences were observed between the two collaborative paradigms in perceived trust or workload. Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration can enhance 2D/3D registration quality assurance, with explainability mechanisms improving user understanding. Future work should refine XAI designs to optimize decision-making performance and efficiency. Extending both the algorithmic design and human-XAI collaboration elements holds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current remote sensing (RS)-specific CLIP variants still inherit this limited spatial awareness. We identify two key limitations behind this: (1) current RS image-text datasets generate global captions from object-level labels, leaving the original object-level supervision underutilized; (2) despite the success of region-text alignment methods in general domain, their direct application to RS data often leads to performance degradation. To address these, we construct the first multi-granularity RS image-text dataset, MGRS-200k, featuring rich object-level textual supervision for RS region-category alignment. We further investigate existing fine-grained CLIP tuning strategies and find that current explicit region-text alignment methods, whether in a direct or indirect way, underperform due to severe degradation of CLIP's semantic coherence. Building on these, we propose FarSLIP, a Fine-grained Aligned RS Language-Image Pretraining framework. Rather than the commonly used patch-to-CLS self-distillation, FarSLIP employs patch-to-patch distillation to align local and global visual cues, which improves feature discriminability while preserving semantic coherence. Additionally, to effectively utilize region-text supervision, it employs simple CLS token-based region-category alignment rather than explicit patch-level alignment, further enhancing spatial awareness. FarSLIP features improved fine-grained vision-language alignment in RS domain and sets a new state of the art not only on RS open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, but also on image-level tasks such as zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval.

The goal is to modify the scene according to a textual instruction while preserving consistency across all views. Existing methods, based on per-scene neural fields or temporal attention mechanisms, struggle in this setting, often producing artifacts and incoherent edits. We propose InstructMix2Mix (I-Mix2Mix), a framework that distills the editing capabilities of a 2D diffusion model into a pretrained multi-view diffusion model, leveraging its data-driven 3D prior for cross-view consistency. A key contribution is replacing the conventional neural field consolidator in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with a multi-view diffusion student, which requires novel adaptations: incremental student updates across timesteps, a specialized teacher noise scheduler to prevent degeneration, and an attention modification that enhances cross-view coherence without additional cost. Experiments demonstrate that I-Mix2Mix significantly improves multi-view consistency while maintaining high per-frame edit quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Detecting Out-of-Distribution Objects through Class-Conditioned Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03292v4)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent object detectors have achieved impressive accuracy in identifying objects seen during training. However, real-world deployment often introduces novel and unexpected objects, referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, posing significant challenges to model trustworthiness. Modern object detectors are typically overconfident, making it unreliable to use their predictions alone for OOD detection. To address this, we propose leveraging an auxiliary model as a complementary solution. Specifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf text-to-image generative model, such as Stable Diffusion, which is trained with objective functions distinct from those of discriminative object detectors. We hypothesize that this fundamental difference enables the detection of OOD objects by measuring inconsistencies between the models. Concretely, for a given detected object bounding box and its predicted in-distribution class label, we perform class-conditioned inpainting on the image with the object removed. If the object is OOD, the inpainted image is likely to deviate significantly from the original, making the reconstruction error a robust indicator of OOD status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses existing zero-shot and non-zero-shot OOD detection methods, establishing a robust framework for enhancing object detection systems in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV 2026 (Algorithms track)</p></details> | None |

We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LED: Light Enhanced Depth Estimation at Night](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08031v3)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nighttime camera-based depth estimation is a highly challenging task, especially for autonomous driving applications, where accurate depth perception is essential for ensuring safe navigation. Models trained on daytime data often fail in the absence of precise but costly LiDAR. Even vision foundation models trained on large amounts of data are unreliable in low-light conditions. In this work, we aim to improve the reliability of perception systems at night time. To this end, we introduce Light Enhanced Depth (LED), a novel, cost-effective approach that significantly improves depth estimation in low-light environments by harnessing a pattern projected by high definition headlights available in modern vehicles. LED leads to significant performance boosts across multiple depth-estimation architectures (encoder-decoder, Adabins, DepthFormer, Depth Anything V2) both on synthetic and real datasets. Furthermore, increased performances beyond illuminated areas reveal a holistic enhancement in scene understanding. Finally, we release the Nighttime Synthetic Drive Dataset, a synthetic and photo-realistic nighttime dataset, which comprises 49,990 comprehensively annotated images.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025 (Poster).

| **[Seeing Beyond the Image: ECG and Anatomical Knowledge-Guided Myocardial Scar Segmentation from Late Gadolinium-Enhanced Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14702v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026.

Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SPIE - Medical Imaging Conference 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[4D-VLA: Spatiotemporal Vision-Language-Action Pretraining with Cross-Scene Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22242v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge. Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead. Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike previous approaches that incorporate 3D representations into models to improve spatial understanding, we aim to unlock the potential of VLMs by leveraging spatially relevant image data. To this end, we introduce a novel 2D spatial data generation and annotation pipeline built upon scene data with 3D ground-truth. This pipeline enables the creation of a diverse set of spatial tasks, ranging from basic perception tasks to more complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct SPAR-7M, a large-scale dataset generated from thousands of scenes across multiple public datasets. In addition, we introduce SPAR-Bench, a benchmark designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of spatial capabilities compared to existing spatial benchmarks, supporting both single-view and multi-view inputs. Training on both SPAR-7M and large-scale 2D datasets enables our models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D spatial benchmarks. Further fine-tuning on 3D task-specific datasets yields competitive results, underscoring the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fudan-zvg.github.io/spar</p></details> | [Code Link](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/spar) |

However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement.

However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Our goal is to devise an effective multi-view imaging technique that can jointly leverage the targets' echo signals at all the receive BSs to precisely construct the image of these targets. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-phase approach. In Phase I, each receive BS recovers an individual image based on the sample covariance matrix of its received signals. Specifically, we propose a novel covariance-based imaging framework to jointly estimate effective scattering intensity and grid positions, which reduces the number of estimated parameters leveraging channel statistical properties and allows grid adjustment to conform to target geometry. In Phase II, the CPU fuses the individual images of all the receivers to construct a high-quality image of all the targets. Specifically, we design edge-preserving natural neighbor interpolation (EP-NNI) to map individual heterogeneous images onto common and finer grids, and then propose a joint optimization framework to estimate fused scattering intensity and BS fields of view. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly enhances imaging performance, facilitating high-quality environment reconstruction for future 6G networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module. The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image. Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy. Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.</p></details> |  | None |

To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.</p></details> |  | None |

Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

This approach captures nonlinear correlations within the data, significantly improving the performance of machine learning algorithms, particularly in processing Hyperspectral Images (HSI) from X-ray transmission spectroscopy. This technique not only preserves the global structure of the data but also enhances feature separability, leading to more accurate and robust classification results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available 3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to 5.6%.

However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint version, under review</p></details> | None |

Even edit requests that consist of only a few words often fail to be executed correctly. We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing.

In this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone, our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes, and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods.

State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4figures | None |

We demonstrate that language can enhance monocular depth estimation by providing an additional condition (rather than images alone) aligned with plausible 3D scenes, thereby reducing the solution space for depth estimation. This conditional distribution is learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. To generate images under various viewpoints and layouts that precisely reflect textual descriptions, the model implicitly models object sizes, shapes, and scales, their spatial relationships, and the overall scene structure. In this paper, Iris, we investigate the benefits of our strategy to integrate text descriptions into training and inference of diffusion-based depth estimation models. We experiment with three different diffusion-based monocular depth estimators (Marigold, Lotus, and E2E-FT) and their variants. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, and evaluating on NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, ScanNet, and DIODE, we find that our strategy improves the overall monocular depth estimation accuracy, especially in small areas. It also improves the model's depth perception of specific regions described in the text. We find that by providing more details in the text, the depth prediction can be iteratively refined. Simultaneously, we find that language can act as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory.

While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Meta-SimGNN: Adaptive and Robust WiFi Localization Across Dynamic Configurations and Diverse Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14076v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Context Matters: Improving Conditioning for Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14063v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FGM-HD: Boosting Generation Diversity of Fractal Generative Models through Hausdorff Dimension Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08945v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.</p></details> | 12 pages, AAAI-26 | None |

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, this often results in severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images, posing significant challenges for clinical applications. Inspired by the success of the Poisson Flow Generative Model (PFGM++) in natural image generation, we propose a PoCGM (Poisson-Conditioned Generative Model) to address the challenges of sparse-view CT reconstruction. Since PFGM++ was originally designed for unconditional generation, it lacks direct applicability to medical imaging tasks that require integrating conditional inputs. To overcome this limitation, the PoCGM reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework by incorporating sparse-view data as guidance during both training and sampling phases. By modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations, PoCGM effectively suppresses artifacts while preserving fine structural details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PoCGM outperforms the baselines, achieving improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th International Meeting on Fully 3D Image Reconstruction in Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Shanghai, CHINA, 2025</p></details> | None |

In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results.

Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter) |

However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.</p></details> |  | None |

While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://haroldchen19.github.io/TiViBench-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://haroldchen19.github.io/TiViBench-Page) |

However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.</p></details> |  | None |

They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods.</p></details> |  | None |

HVI color space has made significant progress in this task by enabling precise decoupling of chrominance and luminance. However, for the interaction of chrominance and luminance branches, substantial distributional differences between the two branches prevalent in natural images limit complementary feature extraction, and luminance errors are propagated to chrominance channels through the nonlinear parameter. Furthermore, for interaction between different chrominance branches, images with large homogeneous-color regions usually exhibit weak correlation between chrominance branches due to concentrated distributions. Traditional pixel-wise losses exploit strong inter-branch correlations for co-optimization, causing gradient conflicts in weakly correlated regions. Therefore, we propose an Inter-Chrominance and Luminance Interaction (ICLR) framework including a Dual-stream Interaction Enhancement Module (DIEM) and a Covariance Correction Loss (CCL).

Our approach leverages two key components: a power-transformed Gaussian-smoothed surrogate $F_{N,σ}(μ) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{N}(μ,σ^2 I_d)}[e^{N f(x)}]$ whose stationary points cluster near the global maximizer $x^*$ of $f$ for sufficiently large $N$, and an incrementally decaying $σ$ for enhanced data efficiency. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence in expectation to a small neighborhood of $x^*$ with the iteration complexity of $O(d^2 \varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirical results show our approach consistently ranks among the top three across a suite of competing algorithms. Its robustness is underscored by the final experiment on a substantially high-dimensional problem ($d=150,528$), where it achieved first place on least-likely targeted black-box attacks against images from ImageNet, surpassing all competing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Multi-Scale Integration Unlocks Robust Cell Annotation in Histopathology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13586v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying cell types and subtypes from routine histopathology images is essential for improving the computational understanding of human disease. Existing tile-based models can capture detailed nuclear morphology but often fail to incorporate the broader tissue context that influences a cell's function and identity. In addition, available human annotations are typically coarse-grained and unevenly distributed across studies, making fine-grained subtype-level supervision difficult to obtain. To address these limitations, we introduce NuClass, a pathologist workflow inspired framework for cell-wise multi-scale integration of nuclear morphology and microenvironmental context. NuClass includes two main components: Path local, which focuses on nuclear morphology from 224-by-224 pixel crops, and Path global, which models the surrounding 1024-by-1024 pixel neighborhood. A learnable gating module adaptively balances local detail and contextual cues. To encourage complementary learning, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided objective that directs the global path to prioritize regions where the local path is uncertain. We also provide calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability. To overcome the lack of high-quality annotations, we construct a marker-guided dataset from Xenium spatial transcriptomics assays, yielding single-cell resolution labels for more than two million cells across eight organs and 16 classes. Evaluated on three fully held-out cohorts, NuClass achieves up to 96 percent F1 for its best-performing class, outperforming strong baselines. Our results show that multi-scale, uncertainty-aware fusion can bridge the gap between slide-level pathological foundation models and reliable, cell-level phenotype prediction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Prompt Learning for Image- and Text-Based Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13575v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve target pedestrian images given either visual queries (image-to-image, I2I) or textual descriptions (text-to-image, T2I). Although both tasks share a common retrieval objective, they pose distinct challenges: I2I emphasizes discriminative identity learning, while T2I requires accurate cross-modal semantic alignment. Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Robust Defense Strategies for Multimodal Contrastive Learning: Efficient Fine-tuning Against Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13545v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of multimodal deep learning models, such as CLIP, has unlocked new frontiers in a wide range of applications, from image-text understanding to classification tasks. However, these models are not safe for adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, which can subtly manipulate model behavior. Moreover, existing defense methods typically involve training from scratch or fine-tuning using a large dataset without pinpointing the specific labels that are affected. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense.</p></details> |  | None |

This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EurIPS 2025 Workshop: Unifying Perspectives on Learning Biases (UPLB)</p></details> | None |

A key challenge is the limited interpretability of deep models. Post-hoc methods like GradCAM offer heatmaps but provide limited conceptual insight, while prototype-based approaches offer example-based explanations but often rely on rigid region selection and lack semantic consistency. To address these limitations, we propose PCMNet, a part-prototypical concept mining network that learns human-comprehensible prototypes from meaningful image regions without additional supervision. By clustering these prototypes into concept groups and extracting concept activation vectors, PCMNet provides structured, concept-level explanations and enhances robustness to occlusion and challenging conditions, which are both critical for building reliable and aligned AI systems. Experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks show that PCMNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in interpretability, stability, and robustness. This work contributes to AI alignment by enhancing transparency, controllability, and trustworthiness in AI systems.

To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Unlocking the Forgery Detection Potential of Vanilla MLLMs: A Novel Training-Free Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13442v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning for Interpretable Quality As- sessment of Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13353v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal image quality assessment (RIQA) supports computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases. However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture.</p></details> |  | None |

Standard adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

This work presents SF-Recon, a method that directly reconstructs lightweight building surfaces from multi-view images without post-hoc mesh simplification. We first train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) field to obtain a view-consistent representation. Building structure is then distilled by a normal-gradient-guided Gaussian optimization that selects primitives aligned with roof and wall boundaries, followed by multi-view edge-consistency pruning to enhance structural sharpness and suppress non-structural artifacts without external supervision. Finally, a multi-view depth-constrained Delaunay triangulation converts the structured Gaussian field into a lightweight, structurally faithful building mesh. Based on a proposed SF dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that our SF-Recon can directly reconstruct lightweight building models from multi-view imagery, achieving substantially fewer faces and vertices while maintaining computational efficiency.

Although many approaches adapt foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a parameter-efficient adaptation of one of the foundational pre-trained vision encoders. The proposed method, GenD, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters (0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical feature manifold using L2 normalization and metric learning on it. We conducted an extensive evaluation on 14 benchmark datasets spanning from 2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC. Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older, diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities. This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method, proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted, minimal changes to a pre-trained foundational image encoder model.

However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision, we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{GeoX-Bench}, a comprehensive \underline{Bench}mark designed to explore and evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in \underline{cross}-view \underline{Geo}-localization and pose estimation.

Our benchmark demonstrate that while current LMMs achieve impressive performance in geo-localization tasks, their effectiveness declines significantly on the more complex pose estimation tasks, highlighting a critical area for future improvement, and instruction-tuning LMMs on the training data of GeoX-Bench can significantly improve the cross-view geo-sense abilities.

We explore ways to enhance performance through multi-context fusion of rich salient image features and camouflaged object features. Therefore, we propose RFMNet, which utilizes features from multiple encoding stages of the reference salient images and performs interactive fusion with the camouflage features at the corresponding encoding stages. Given that the features in salient object images contain abundant object-related detail information, performing feature fusion within local areas is more beneficial for detecting camouflaged objects. Therefore, we propose an Overlapped Windows Cross-attention mechanism to enable the model to focus more attention on the local information matching based on reference features. Besides, we propose the Referring Feature Aggregation (RFA) module to decode and segment the camouflaged objects progressively.

Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies have proposed increasingly advanced deep neural networks and training strategies for deep clustering, effectively improving performance. However, deep clustering generally remains challenging due to the inadequacy of supervision signals. Building upon the existing representation learning backbones, this paper proposes a novel clustering strategy of gradual community detection. It initializes clustering by partitioning samples into many pseudo-communities and then gradually expands clusters by community merging. Compared with the existing clustering strategies, community detection factors in the new perspective of cluster network analysis in the clustering process. The new perspective can effectively leverage global structural characteristics to enhance cluster pseudo-label purity, which is critical to the performance of self-supervision. We have implemented the proposed approach based on the popular backbones and evaluated its efficacy on benchmark image datasets. Our extensive experiments have shown that the proposed clustering strategy can effectively improve the SOTA performance. Our ablation study also demonstrates that the new network perspective can effectively improve community pseudo-label purity, resulting in improved self-supervision.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures | None |

Queries in XMC are associated with relevant labels from extremely large label spaces, where it is critical to strike a balance between efficiency and performance. Therefore, many recent approaches efficiently pose XMC as a maximum inner product search between embeddings learned from small encoder-only transformer architectures. In this paper, we address two important aspects in XMC: how to effectively harness larger decoder-only models, and how to exploit visual information while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate that both play a critical role in XMC separately and can be combined for improved performance. We show that a few billion-size decoder can deliver substantial improvements while keeping computational overhead manageable. Furthermore, our Vision-enhanced eXtreme Multi-label Learning framework (ViXML) efficiently integrates foundation vision models by pooling a single embedding per image. This limits computational growth while unlocking multi-modal capabilities. Remarkably, ViXML with small encoders outperforms text-only decoder in most cases, showing that an image is worth billions of parameters. Finally, we present an extension of existing text-only datasets to exploit visual metadata and make them available for future benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments across four public text-only datasets and their corresponding image enhanced versions validate our proposals' effectiveness, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by up to +8.21\% in P@1 on the largest dataset.

Preference optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes through CFG. However, prior NPO approaches rely on costly and fragile procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose Self-NPO, specifically truncated diffusion fine-tuning, a data-free approach of negative preference optimization by directly learning from the model itself, eliminating the need for manual data labeling or reward model training. This data-free approach is highly efficient (less than 1% training cost of Diffusion-NPO) and achieves comparable performance to Diffusion-NPO in a data-free manner. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences, consistently enhancing both their generation quality and alignment with human preferences.

Although deep learning has achieved great success in many cross-modal tasks, its performance on SAR-Optical registration tasks is still unsatisfactory. Gradient-based information has traditionally played a crucial role in handcrafted descriptors by highlighting structural differences. However, such gradient cues have not been effectively leveraged in deep learning frameworks for SAR-Optical image matching. To address this gap, we propose SOMA, a dense registration framework that integrates structural gradient priors into deep features and refines alignment through a hybrid matching strategy. Specifically, we introduce the Feature Gradient Enhancer (FGE), which embeds multi-scale, multi-directional gradient filters into the feature space using attention and reconstruction mechanisms to boost feature distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose the Global-Local Affine-Flow Matcher (GLAM), which combines affine transformation and flow-based refinement within a coarse-to-fine architecture to ensure both structural consistency and local accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SOMA significantly improves registration precision, increasing the CMR@1px by 12.29% on the SEN1-2 dataset and 18.50% on the GFGE_SO dataset. In addition, SOMA exhibits strong robustness and generalizes well across diverse scenes and resolutions.</p></details> |  | None |

A key challenge is to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$ circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025. 10 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Virtual Multiplex Staining for Histological Images using a Marker-wise Conditioned Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14681v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling complex data distributions by utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers. To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches. This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&E image repositories.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 accepted | None |

To overcome these challenges and to accelerate the adaptation of LLMs for telecom, we propose MM-Telco, a comprehensive suite of multimodal benchmarks and models tailored for the telecom domain. The benchmark introduces various tasks (both text based and image based) that address various practical real-life use cases such as network operations, network management, improving documentation quality, and retrieval of relevant text and images. Further, we perform baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. The models fine-tuned on our dataset exhibit a significant boost in performance.

Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong temporal reasoning capabilities, making them a promising tool for enhancing reconstruction quality under sparse-view settings. However, existing approaches are primarily designed for modest viewpoint variations, which struggle in capturing fine-grained details in close-up scenarios since input information is severely limited. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based framework, called CloseUpShot, for close-up novel view synthesis from sparse inputs via point-conditioned video diffusion. Specifically, we observe that pixel-warping conditioning suffers from severe sparsity and background leakage in close-up settings. To address this, we propose hierarchical warping and occlusion-aware noise suppression, enhancing the quality and completeness of the conditioning images for the video diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce global structure guidance, which leverages a dense fused point cloud to provide consistent geometric context to the diffusion process, to compensate for the lack of globally consistent 3D constraints in sparse conditioning inputs. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, especially in close-up novel view synthesis, clearly validating the effectiveness of our design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Link: https://zyqz97.github.io/CloseUpShot/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zyqz97.github.io/CloseUpShot) |

While existing deraining methods have made considerable progress, they often struggle with fidelity of semantic and spatial details. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Prior Hierarchical Mamba (MPHM) network for image deraining. This novel architecture synergistically integrates macro-semantic textual priors (CLIP) for task-level semantic guidance and micro-structural visual priors (DINOv2) for scene-aware structural information. To alleviate potential conflicts between heterogeneous priors, we devise a progressive Priors Fusion Injection (PFI) that strategically injects complementary cues at different decoder levels. Meanwhile, we equip the backbone network with an elaborate Hierarchical Mamba Module (HMM) to facilitate robust feature representation, featuring a Fourier-enhanced dual-path design that concurrently addresses global context modeling and local detail recovery. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MPHM's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 0.57 dB PSNR gain on the Rain200H dataset while delivering superior generalization on real-world rainy scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Implicit Neural Degradation Representation for Unpaired Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13110v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing is an important task in the field of computer vision, aiming at restoring clear and detail-rich visual content from haze-affected images. However, when dealing with complex scenes, existing methods often struggle to strike a balance between fine-grained feature representation of inhomogeneous haze distribution and global consistency modeling. Furthermore, to better learn the common degenerate representation of haze in spatial variations, we propose an unsupervised dehaze method for implicit neural degradation representation. Firstly, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a mechanism combining the channel-independent and channel-dependent mechanisms, which efficiently enhances the ability to learn from nonlinear dependencies. which in turn achieves good visual perception in complex scenes. Moreover, we design an implicit neural representation to model haze degradation as a continuous function to eliminate redundant information and the dependence on explicit feature extraction and physical models. To further learn the implicit representation of the haze features, we also designed a dense residual enhancement module from it to eliminate redundant information. This achieves high-quality image restoration. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive dehaze performance on various public and real-world datasets.

| **[Low-Level Dataset Distillation for Medical Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13106v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image enhancement is clinically valuable, but existing methods require large-scale datasets to learn complex pixel-level mappings. However, the substantial training and storage costs associated with these datasets hinder their practical deployment. While dataset distillation (DD) can alleviate these burdens, existing methods mainly target high-level tasks, where multiple samples share the same label. This many-to-one mapping allows distilled data to capture shared semantics and achieve information compression. In contrast, low-level tasks involve a many-to-many mapping that requires pixel-level fidelity, making low-level DD an underdetermined problem, as a small distilled dataset cannot fully constrain the dense pixel-level mappings. To address this, we propose the first low-level DD method for medical image enhancement. We first leverage anatomical similarities across patients to construct the shared anatomical prior based on a representative patient, which serves as the initialization for the distilled data of different patients. This prior is then personalized for each patient using a Structure-Preserving Personalized Generation (SPG) module, which integrates patient-specific anatomical information into the distilled dataset while preserving pixel-level fidelity. For different low-level tasks, the distilled data is used to construct task-specific high- and low-quality training pairs. Patient-specific knowledge is injected into the distilled data by aligning the gradients computed from networks trained on the distilled pairs with those from the corresponding patient's raw data. Notably, downstream users cannot access raw patient data. Instead, only a distilled dataset containing abstract training information is shared, which excludes patient-specific details and thus preserves privacy.</p></details> |  | None |

While this paradigm enhances robustness and flexibility by disentangling the dependency of support images, our critical analysis reveals two inherent limitations of static joint embedding: (1) polysemy-induced cross-category ambiguity during the matching process(e.g., the concept "leg" exhibiting divergent visual manifestations across humans and furniture), and (2) insufficient discriminability for fine-grained intra-category variations (e.g., posture and fur discrepancies between a sleeping white cat and a standing black cat). To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework that innovatively integrates hierarchical cross-modal interaction with dual-stream feature refinement, enhancing the joint embedding with both class-level and instance-specific cues from textual description and specific images. Experiments on the MP-100 dataset demonstrate that, regardless of the network backbone, CapeNext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CAPE methods by a large margin.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Collective Intelligence: Uncertainty-aware SAM Adaptation for Ambiguous Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10931v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collective intelligence from multiple medical experts consistently surpasses individual expertise in clinical diagnosis, particularly for ambiguous medical image segmentation tasks involving unclear tissue boundaries or pathological variations. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a powerful vision foundation model originally designed for natural image segmentation, has shown remarkable potential when adapted to medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing SAM adaptation methods follow a single-expert paradigm, developing models based on individual expert annotations to predict deterministic masks. These methods systematically ignore the inherent uncertainty and variability in expert annotations, which fundamentally contradicts clinical practice, where multiple specialists provide different yet equally valid interpretations that collectively enhance diagnostic confidence. We propose an Uncertainty-aware Adapter, the first SAM adaptation framework designed to transition from single expert mindset to collective intelligence representation. Our approach integrates stochastic uncertainty sampling from a Conditional Variational Autoencoder into the adapters, enabling diverse prediction generation that captures expert knowledge distributions rather than individual expert annotations. We employ a novel position-conditioned control mechanism to integrate multi-expert knowledge, ensuring that the output distribution closely aligns with the multi-annotation distribution. Comprehensive evaluations across seven medical segmentation benchmarks have demonstrated that our collective intelligence-based adaptation achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new adaptation framework for reliable clinical implementation.</p></details> |  | None |

While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |

We present EMSGlass, a smart-glasses system powered by EMSNet, the first multimodal multitask model for Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and EMSServe, a low-latency multimodal serving framework tailored to EMS scenarios. EMSNet integrates text, vital signs, and scene images to construct a unified real-time understanding of EMS incidents. Trained on real-world multimodal EMS datasets, EMSNet simultaneously supports up to five critical EMS tasks with superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art unimodal baselines. Built on top of PyTorch, EMSServe introduces a modality-aware model splitter and a feature caching mechanism, achieving adaptive and efficient inference across heterogeneous hardware while addressing the challenge of asynchronous modality arrival in the field. By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves 1.9x -- 11.7x speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference. A user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction. In addition, qualitative insights from the user study provide actionable directions for extending EMSGlass toward next-generation AI-enabled EMS systems, bridging multimodal intelligence with real-world emergency response workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

However, acquiring HSI data remains costly and technically demanding. Hyperspectral image reconstruction offers a practical solution by recovering HSI data from accessible modalities, such as RGB. While general domain datasets are abundant, the scarcity of human HSI data limits progress in medical applications. To tackle this, we propose SpectralAdapt, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that bridges the domain gap between general and human-centered HSI datasets. To fully exploit limited labels and abundant unlabeled data, we enhance spectral reasoning by introducing Spectral Density Masking (SDM), which adaptively masks RGB channels based on their spectral complexity, encouraging recovery of informative regions from complementary cues during consistency training. Furthermore, we introduce Spectral Endmember Representation Alignment (SERA), which derives physically interpretable endmembers from valuable labeled pixels and employs them as domain-invariant anchors to guide unlabeled predictions, with momentum updates ensuring adaptability and stability. These components are seamlessly integrated into SpectralAdapt, a spectral prior-guided framework that effectively mitigates domain shift, spectral degradation, and data scarcity in HSI reconstruction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity, cross-domain generalization, and training stability, highlighting the promise of SSDA as an efficient solution for hyperspectral imaging in healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose the Quadtree Diffusion Model (QDM), a region-adaptive diffusion framework that leverages a quadtree structure to selectively enhance detail-rich regions while reducing computations in homogeneous areas. By guiding the diffusion with a quadtree derived from the low-quality input, QDM identifies key regions-represented by leaf nodes-where fine detail is essential and applies minimal refinement elsewhere. This mask-guided, two-stream architecture adaptively balances quality and efficiency, producing high-fidelity outputs with low computational redundancy. Experiments demonstrate QDM's effectiveness in high-resolution SR tasks across diverse image types, particularly in medical imaging (e.g., CT scans), where large homogeneous regions are prevalent. Furthermore, QDM outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art SR methods on standard benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs, highlighting its efficiency and suitability for resource-limited environments.

Such cross-modal couplings can produce unsafe semantics even when individual inputs are benign, exposing the fragile safety awareness of current MLLMs. While recent works enhance safety by guiding models to reason about potential risks, unregulated reasoning traces may compromise alignment; although Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers self-rewarded refinement without human supervision, it lacks verifiable signals for reasoning safety. To address this, we propose SafeGRPO a self-rewarded multimodal safety alignment framework that integrates rule-governed reward construction into GRPO, enabling interpretable and verifiable optimization of reasoning safety. Built upon the constructed SafeTag-VL-3K dataset with explicit visual, textual, and combined safety tags, SafeGRPO performs step-guided safety thinking to enforce structured reasoning and behavior alignment, substantially improving multimodal safety awareness, compositional robustness, and reasoning stability across diverse benchmarks without sacrificing general capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image. Cross-dataset validation on COCO and Pascal VOC further confirms consistent performance gains, indicating that morphology-driven spatial quantization can enhance efficiency and robustness for computationally constrained, safety-critical visual recognition tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables.

Despite progress in deep learning-based approaches, existing methods often fail to capture global priors inherent in remote sensing data distributions. Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as promising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities, however, they suffer from heavy inference latency. We introduce KSDiff, a fast kernel-space diffusion framework that generates convolutional kernels enriched with global context to enhance pansharpening quality and accelerate inference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the integration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator, orchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, facilitating integration into existing pansharpening architectures. Experiments show that KSDiff achieves superior performance compared to recent promising methods, and with over $500 \times$ faster inference than diffusion-based pansharpening baselines.

However, real-world applications also require discovering and classifying multiple anomaly types. Since industrial anomalies are semantically subtle and current methods do not sufficiently exploit image priors, direct clustering approaches often perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose ProtoAnomalyNCD, a prototype-learning-based framework for discovering unseen anomaly classes of multiple types that can be integrated with various anomaly detection methods. First, to suppress background clutter, we leverage Grounded SAM with text prompts to localize object regions as priors for the anomaly classification network. Next, because anomalies usually appear as subtle and fine-grained patterns on the product, we introduce an Anomaly-Map-Guided Attention block. Within this block, we design a Region Guidance Factor that helps the attention module distinguish among background, object regions, and anomalous regions. By using both localized product regions and anomaly maps as priors, the module enhances anomalous features while suppressing background noise and preserving normal features for contrastive learning. Finally, under a unified prototype-learning framework, ProtoAnomalyNCD discovers and clusters unseen anomaly classes while simultaneously enabling multi-type anomaly classification. We further extend our method to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification.

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures | None |

However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.</p></details> |  | None |
