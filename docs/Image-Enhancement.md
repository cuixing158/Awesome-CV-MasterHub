| **[G$^2$VLM: Geometry Grounded Vision Language Model with Unified 3D Reconstruction and Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21688v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code are released at https://github.com/InternRobotics/G2VLM</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/InternRobotics/G2VLM) |
| **[Attention-Guided Patch-Wise Sparse Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21663v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Qwen3-VL Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21631v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.</p></details> | 42 pages | None |

To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Age-specific Alzheimer 's Disease Prediction with Characteristic Constraints in Nonuniform Time Span](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21530v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[CanKD: Cross-Attention-based Non-local operation for Feature-based Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21503v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks.

| **[SAM Guided Semantic and Motion Changed Region Mining for Remote Sensing Change Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21420v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

| **[DiverseVAR: Balancing Diversity and Quality of Next-Scale Visual Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21415v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Earth-Adapter: Bridge the Geospatial Domain Gaps with Mixture of Frequency Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06220v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a technique that allows us to adapt powerful Foundation Models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks while preserving and unleashing their inherent capabilities. However, we have observed that existing PEFT methods, which are often designed with natural imagery in mind, struggle when applied to Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios. This is primarily due to their inability to handle artifact influences, a problem particularly severe in RS image features. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Earth-Adapter, the first PEFT method specifically designed for RS artifacts conquering. Earth-Adapter introduces a novel Mixture of Frequency Adaptation process that combines a Mixture of Adapter (MoA) with Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). By utilizing DFT, Earth-Adapter can decompose features into different frequency components, precisely separating artifacts from original features. The MoA then dynamically assigns weights to each adapter expert, allowing for the combination of features across various frequency domains. These simple-yet-effective approaches enable Earth-Adapter to more efficiently overcome the disturbances caused by artifacts than previous PEFT methods, significantly enhancing the FMs' performance on RS scenarios. Experiments on Domain Adaptation (DA), and Domain Generalization (DG) semantic segmentation benchmarks showcase the Earth-Adapter's effectiveness. Compared with baseline Rein, Earth-Adapter significantly improves 9.0% mIoU in DA and 3.1% mIoU in DG benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/VisionXLab/Earth-Adapter.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 camera ready</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/VisionXLab/Earth-Adapter) |
| **[Monet: Reasoning in Latent Visual Space Beyond Images and Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21395v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning. Our model, data, and code are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/Monet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/NOVAglow646/Monet) |
| **[One-Step Diffusion-Based Image Compression with Semantic Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16687v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent diffusion-based generative image codecs have shown impressive performance, their iterative sampling process introduces unpleasing latency. In this work, we revisit the design of a diffusion-based codec and argue that multi-step sampling is not necessary for generative compression. Based on this insight, we propose OneDC, a One-step Diffusion-based generative image Codec -- that integrates a latent compression module with a one-step diffusion generator. Recognizing the critical role of semantic guidance in one-step diffusion, we propose using the hyperprior as a semantic signal, overcoming the limitations of text prompts in representing complex visual content. To further enhance the semantic capability of the hyperprior, we introduce a semantic distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from a pretrained generative tokenizer to the hyperprior codec. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid pixel- and latent-domain optimization to jointly enhance both reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneDC achieves SOTA perceptual quality even with one-step generation, offering over 39% bitrate reduction and 20x faster decoding compared to prior multi-step diffusion-based codecs.

| **[VA-GS: Enhancing the Geometric Representation of Gaussian Splatting via View Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11473v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment. In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

| **[Anomaly Detection with Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection for Contaminated Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21378v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Without Paired Labeled Data: End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning for Drone-view Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11381v5)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-view Geo-Localization (DVGL) aims to achieve accurate localization of drones by retrieving the most relevant GPS-tagged satellite images. However, most existing methods heavily rely on strictly pre-paired drone-satellite images for supervised learning. When the target region shifts, new paired samples are typically required to adapt to the distribution changes. The high cost of annotation and the limited transferability of these methods significantly hinder the practical deployment of DVGL in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning method with a shallow backbone network, called the dynamic memory-driven and neighborhood information learning (DMNIL) method. It employs a clustering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels and adopts a dual-path contrastive learning framework to learn discriminative intra-view representations. Furthermore, DMNIL incorporates two core modules, including the dynamic hierarchical memory learning (DHML) module and the information consistency evolution learning (ICEL) module. The DHML module combines short-term and long-term memory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and discriminability. Meanwhile, the ICEL module utilizes a neighborhood-driven dynamic constraint mechanism to systematically capture implicit cross-view semantic correlations, consequently improving cross-view feature alignment. To further stabilize and strengthen the self-supervised training process, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy is introduced to enhance the quality of pseudo supervision. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art supervised methods.

| **[Co-Training Vision Language Models for Remote Sensing Multi-task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21272v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[LaGen: Towards Autoregressive LiDAR Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21256v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AMLP: Adjustable Masking Lesion Patches for Self-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04312v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) methods have shown promising performances on analyzing natural images. However, directly applying such methods to medical image segmentation tasks still cannot achieve satisfactory results. The challenges arise from the facts that (i) medical images are inherently more complex compared to natural images, and the subjects in medical images often exhibit more distinct contour features; (ii) moreover, the conventional high and fixed masking ratio in MIM is likely to mask the background, limiting the scope of learnable information. To address these problems, we propose a new self-supervised medical image segmentation framework, called Adjustable Masking Lesion Patches (AMLP), which employs Masked Patch Selection~(MPS) strategy to identify patches with high probabilities of containing lesions to help model achieve precise lesion reconstruction. To improve the categorization of patches in MPS, we further introduce Relative Reconstruction Loss (RRL) to better learn hard-to-reconstruct lesion patches. Then, Category Consistency Loss (CCL) is proposed to refine patch categorization based on reconstruction difficulty, enhancing difference between lesions and backgrounds. Moreover, an Adjustable Masking Ratio (AMR) strategy is proposed to gradually increase the masking ratio over training to expand~the scope of learnable mutual information. Extensive~experiments on two medical segmentation datasets demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed AMLP w.r.t. the SOTA self-supervised methods; the results prove that AMLP effectively addresses the challenges of applying masked modeling to medical images and capturing accurate lesion details that are crucial for segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>© 202...</summary><p>© 2025 IEEE.

Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot guarantee the generated multi-view images are 3D consistent. In this paper, we propose Gen-3Diffusion: Realistic Image-to-3D Generation via 2D & 3D Diffusion Synergy. We leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model and a 3D diffusion model via our elegantly designed process that synchronizes two diffusion models at both training and sampling time. The synergy between the 2D and 3D diffusion models brings two major advantages: 1) 2D helps 3D in generalization: the pretrained 2D model has strong generalization ability to unseen images, providing strong shape priors for the 3D diffusion model; 2) 3D helps 2D in multi-view consistency: the 3D diffusion model enhances the 3D consistency of 2D multi-view sampling process, resulting in more accurate multi-view generation. We validate our idea through extensive experiments in image-based objects and clothed avatar generation tasks. Results show that our method generates realistic 3D objects and avatars with high-fidelity geometry and texture. Extensive ablations also validate our design choices and demonstrate the strong generalization ability to diverse clothing and compositional shapes.

To address this issue, noise-robust loss functions offer an effective solution for enhancing learning in the presence of label noise. In this work, we systematically investigate the limitation of the recently proposed Active Passive Loss (APL), which employs Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as its passive loss function. Despite the robustness brought by MAE, one of its key drawbacks is that it pays equal attention to clean and noisy samples; this feature slows down convergence and potentially makes training difficult, particularly in large-scale datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel loss function class, termed Normalized Negative Loss Functions (NNLFs), which serve as passive loss functions within the APL framework. NNLFs effectively address the limitations of MAE by concentrating more on memorized clean samples. By replacing MAE in APL with our proposed NNLFs, we enhance APL and present a new framework called Active Negative Loss (ANL). Moreover, in non-symmetric noise scenarios, we propose an entropy-based regularization technique to mitigate the vulnerability to the label imbalance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the new loss functions adopted by our ANL framework can achieve better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods across various label noise types and in image segmentation tasks.

Existing watermarking techniques either target base models or verify LoRA modules themselves, yet they fail to propagate watermarks to generated images, leaving a critical gap in traceability. Moreover, traceability watermarking designed for base models is not tightly coupled with stylization and often introduces visual degradation or high false-positive detection rates. To address these limitations, we propose AuthenLoRA, a unified watermarking framework that embeds imperceptible, traceable watermarks directly into the LoRA training process while preserving stylization quality. AuthenLoRA employs a dual-objective optimization strategy that jointly learns the target style distribution and the watermark-induced distribution shift, ensuring that any image generated with the watermarked LoRA reliably carries the watermark. We further design an expanded LoRA architecture for enhanced multi-scale adaptation and introduce a zero-message regularization mechanism that substantially reduces false positives during watermark verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuthenLoRA achieves high-fidelity stylization, robust watermark propagation, and significantly lower false-positive rates compared with existing approaches.

We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures.

| **[Progress by Pieces: Test-Time Scaling for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21185v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://grid-ar.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Uncovering and Mitigating Destructive Multi-Embedding Attacks in Deepfake Proactive Forensics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17247v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability, they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing methods against MEA.</p></details> |  | None |

We developed a hybrid transformer convolutional network to segment cardiac substructures in lung and breast cancer patients with varying imaging contrasts and scan positions. Cohort I (56 contrast-enhanced CT [CECT], 124 non-contrast CT [NCCT] scans from lung cancer patients, supine position) was used to train an oracle model (180 cases), contrast-only model (56 CECTs), and balanced model (32 CECT, 32 NCCT). All models were evaluated on 60 held-out cohort I patients and 66 cohort II breast cancer patients (45 supine, 21 prone). Accuracy was measured using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), and dosimetric metrics, with TotalSegmentator as benchmark. Oracle and balanced models achieved similar accuracy (DSC: Oracle vs Balanced: Cohort I: 0.84 $\pm$ 0.10 vs 0.82 $\pm$ 0.10; Cohort II: 0.81 $\pm$ 0.12 vs 0.80 $\pm$ 0.13), both outperforming TotalSegmentator and the contrast-only models. The balanced model, using 64% fewer training cases, produced dosimetrically equivalent contours to manual delineations. It was robust to contrast variations (6 out of 8 substructures) and positioning variations (5 out of 8 substructures), with low correlation to patient age or body mass index. Our balanced model demonstrated robust geometric and dosimetric accuracy across varying imaging protocols and patient characteristics, which is essential for clinical deployment. Combining pretraining with balanced NCCT/CECT distribution enabled reliable segmentation with substantially fewer labeled cases than conventional approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CAPability: A Comprehensive Visual Caption Benchmark for Evaluating Both Correctness and Thoroughness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14914v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages, 3 figures, ISVC conference 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye) |
| **[Deep Parameter Interpolation for Scalar Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21028v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose deep parameter interpolation (DPI), a general-purpose method for transforming an existing deep neural network architecture into one that accepts an additional scalar input. Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

| **[EmoFeedback$^2$: Reinforcement of Continuous Emotional Image Generation via LVLM-based Reward and Textual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19982v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous emotional image generation (C-EICG) is emerging rapidly due to its ability to produce images aligned with both user descriptions and continuous emotional values. However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback$^2$) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset. The code and dataset will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08425v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automated Neural Architecture Design for Industrial Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06669v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection platform.

However, their complex logical reasoning performance on text-rich images remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark comprising 2780 questions with two subsets, i.e., LogicOCR-Gen with 1100 multi-choice questions on generated images, and LogicOCR-Real with 1680 meticulously designed free-form questions on real-world images. For constructing LogicOCR-Gen, we first curate a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination, and customize an automatic pipeline to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with varied layouts and fonts, ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images are manually verified. We evaluate a range of representative LMMs under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences, and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. Moreover, we propose TextCue, a training-free method that enhances LMMs' perception of image regions containing important text cues for solving questions. We leverage LMMs' attention maps and an off-the-shelf text segmentation specialist to determine the region, which is then cropped and enlarged to augment the original image. Experiments show its effectiveness, e.g., a 1.8% accuracy gain over LLaVA-OV-1.5-8B under the CoT setting.

Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization and few-shot capabilities across diverse visual domains. In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation datasets and domains show that VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images. To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery. Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE 15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems (ICPRS-25)</p></details> | None |

Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, 3D reconstruction methods, such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), have been used to create implicit neural representations of HSI scenes. This capability enables the rendering of hyperspectral channel compositions at every spatial location, thereby helping localize the target object's nutrient composition both spatially and spectrally. However, it faces limitations in training time and rendering speed. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-Denoised Hyperspectral Gaussian Splatting (DD-HGS), which enhances the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method with wavelength-aware spherical harmonics, a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based spectral loss, and a diffusion-based denoiser to enable 3D explicit reconstruction of the hyperspectral scenes for the entire spectral range.

While the datasets play an important role, their protection has remained as an unsolved issue.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach, EnTruth, which Enhances Traceability of unauthorized dataset usage utilizing template memorization. By strategically incorporating the template memorization, EnTruth can trigger the specific behavior in unauthorized models as the evidence of infringement. Our method is the first to investigate the positive application of memorization and use it for copyright protection, which turns a curse into a blessing and offers a pioneering perspective for unauthorized usage detection in generative models.

Despite the rapid rise and promise of implantable technologies, there is a need for better and more capable wearable and non-invasive approaches whilst also minimising hardware requirements. We present a non-invasive BCI for mind-drawing that iteratively infers a subject's internal visual intent by adaptively presenting visual stimuli (probes) on a screen encoded at different flicker-frequencies and analyses the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). A Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically update the spatial placement of the visual probes on the screen to explore the image space and reconstruct simple imagined shapes within approximately two minutes or less using just single-channel EEG data. Additionally, by leveraging stable diffusion models, reconstructed mental images can be transformed into realistic and detailed visual representations. Whilst we expect that similar results might be achievable with e.g. eye-tracking techniques, our work shows that symbiotic human-AI interaction can significantly increase BCI bit-rates by more than a factor 5x, providing a platform for future development of AI-augmented BCI.</p></details> |  | None |

This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce TokenWarping, a novel framework for temporally coherent video translation. Existing diffusion-based video editing approaches rely solely on key and value patches in self-attention to ensure temporal consistency, often sacrificing the preservation of local and structural regions. Critically, these methods overlook the significance of the query patches in achieving accurate feature aggregation and temporal coherence. In contrast, TokenWarping leverages complementary token priors by constructing temporal correlations across different frames. Our method begins by extracting optical flows from source videos. During the denoising process of the diffusion model, these optical flows are used to warp the previous frame's query, key, and value patches, aligning them with the current frame's patches. By directly warping the query patches, we enhance feature aggregation in self-attention, while warping the key and value patches ensures temporal consistency across frames. This token warping imposes explicit constraints on the self-attention layer outputs, effectively ensuring temporally coherent translation. Our framework does not require any additional training or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated with existing text-to-image editing methods. We conduct extensive experiments on various video translation tasks, demonstrating that TokenWarping surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection. Our source code, dataset, and trained model are available at https://github.com/toobatehreem/MedROV.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/toobatehreem/MedROV) |

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a "motion edit" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating "motion counterfactuals", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

However, current methods still face challenges, including the lack of intricate details, overly smoothed surfaces, and fragmented thin-shell structures. These limitations leave the generated 3D assets still one step short of meeting the standards favored by artists. In this paper, we present ShapeGen, which achieves high-quality image-to-3D shape generation through 3D representation and supervision improvements, resolution scaling up, and the advantages of linear transformers. These advancements allow the generated assets to be seamlessly integrated into 3D pipelines, facilitating their widespread adoption across various applications. Through extensive experiments, we validate the impact of these improvements on overall performance. Ultimately, thanks to the synergistic effects of these enhancements, ShapeGen achieves a significant leap in image-to-3D generation, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Flash-DMD: Towards High-Fidelity Few-Step Image Generation with Efficient Distillation and Joint Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20549v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models have emerged as a leading class of generative models, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally expensive. Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics. Our work presents an effective paradigm for training efficient, high-fidelity, and stable generative models. Codes are coming soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Personalized Generative Low-light Image Denoising and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14327v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cameras' performance in low-light conditions remains suboptimal due to fundamental limitations in photon shot noise and sensor read noise. Generative image restoration methods have shown promising results compared to traditional approaches, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Leveraging the availability of personalized photo galleries of the users, we introduce Diffusion-based Personalized Generative Denoising (DiffPGD), a new approach that builds a customized diffusion model for individual users. Our key innovation lies in the development of an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer serves as a robust prior that can be seamlessly integrated into the diffusion model to restore degraded images without the need for fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that DiffPGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.

| **[HBridge: H-Shape Bridging of Heterogeneous Experts for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20520v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent unified models integrate understanding experts (e.g., LLMs) with generative experts (e.g., diffusion models), achieving strong multimodal performance. However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of HBridge, establishing a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation.</p></details> |  | None |

An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Training-Free Approach for Multi-ID Customization via Attention Adjustment and Spatial Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20401v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-ID customization is an interesting topic in computer vision and attracts considerable attention recently. Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that BoxPromptIML outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models, while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360° panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense. Our results not only show a promising path forward but also quantify the immense challenge that remains in building MLLM agents that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday human life.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling for Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> | [Code Link](https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe) |

In this paper, we present a deep learning framework that predicts a 4-point parameterized homography matrix to rectify shelf images captured from arbitrary angles. Our model leverages a ConvNeXt-based backbone for enhanced feature representation and adopts normalized coordinate regression for improved stability. To address data scarcity and promote generalization, we introduce a novel augmentation strategy by modeling and sampling synthetic homographies. Our method achieves a mean corner error of 1.298 pixels on the test set. When compared with both classical computer vision and deep learning-based approaches, our method demonstrates competitive performance in both accuracy and inference speed. Together, these results establish our approach as a robust and efficient solution for realworld single-view rectification. To encourage further research in this domain, we will make our dataset, ShelfRectSet, and code publicly available</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information. Experiments on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of our IrisNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 10pages,5figures | None |

Our goal is to reconstruct high fidelity ground truth like representations of stellar objects, a task that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image to image translation but often distort the morphology of stars and produce barely resembling images. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with some key innovations: multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near infrared (NIR) domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology. Ground truth references from multi-mission all sky surveys spanning optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to generate reconstructions that are visually sharper outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical image enhancement.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TaCo: Capturing Spatio-Temporal Semantic Consistency in Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20306v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes across bi-temporal satellite images. Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes. This design can yield substantial performance gains without introducing any additional computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, spanning both binary and semantic change detection tasks, demonstrate that TaCo consistently achieves SOTA performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.</p></details> |  | None |

However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation. Building on our analysis, we develop a theoretical framework that increases sampling entropy through prompt reformulation and propose a training-free method, PromptMoG, which samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to enhance diversity while preserving semantics. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art models, SD3.5-Large, Flux.1-Krea-Dev, CogView4, and Qwen-Image, demonstrate that PromptMoG consistently improves long-prompt generation diversity without semantic drifting.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions. By effectively reconstructing complex anatomical features with reduced data and under fiber perturbations, HistoSpeckle-Net brings MMF imaging closer to practical deployment in real-world clinical environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC), significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution, establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC, seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Our framework includes two components based on diffusion priors: an inverse renderer that estimates material properties, scene geometry, and lighting as intrinsic maps from an input image, and a forward renderer that utilizes these geometry and material maps along with a text prompt that describes specific weather conditions to generate a final image. The intrinsic maps enhance controllability compared to traditional pixel-space editing approaches.We propose an intrinsic map-aware attention mechanism that improves spatial correspondence and decomposition quality in large outdoor scenes. For forward rendering, we leverage CLIP-space interpolation of weather prompts to achieve fine-grained weather control. We also introduce a synthetic and a real-world dataset, containing 38k and 18k images under various weather conditions, each with intrinsic map annotations. WeatherDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art pixel-space editing approaches, weather restoration methods, and rendering-based methods, showing promise for downstream tasks such as autonomous driving, enhancing the robustness of detection and segmentation in challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[V-Attack: Targeting Disentangled Value Features for Controllable Adversarial Attacks on LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20223v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks have evolved from simply disrupting predictions on conventional task-specific models to the more complex goal of manipulating image semantics on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control.

In this paper we address the solution of learning problems using these satellite constellations. In particular, we focus on a federated approach, where satellites collect and locally process data, with the ground station aggregating local models. We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression). We then propose an error feedback mechanism that enhances accuracy, which yields, as a byproduct, an algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme that can be more broadly applied. We analyze the convergence of the resulting algorithm, and compare it with the state of the art through simulations in a realistic space scenario, showcasing superior performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text-guided Controllable Diffusion for Realistic Camouflage Images Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20218v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflage Images Generation (CIG) is an emerging research area that focuses on synthesizing images in which objects are harmoniously blended and exhibit high visual consistency with their surroundings. Existing methods perform CIG by either fusing objects into specific backgrounds or outpainting the surroundings via foreground object-guided diffusion. However, they often fail to obtain natural results because they overlook the logical relationship between camouflaged objects and background environments. To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness. Moreover, we design a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module (FIRM) to capture high-frequency texture features, facilitating the learning of complex camouflage patterns. Extensive experiments, including CLIPScore evaluation and camouflage effectiveness assessment, demonstrate the semantic alignment of our generated text prompts and CT-CIG's ability to produce photorealistic camouflage images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Panoramic Distortion-Aware Tokenization for Person Detection and Localization in Overhead Fisheye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14228v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person detection in overhead fisheye images is challenging due to person rotation and small persons. Prior work has mainly addressed person rotation, leaving the small-person problem underexplored. We remap fisheye images to equirectangular panoramas to handle rotation and exploit panoramic geometry to handle small persons more effectively. Conventional detection methods tend to favor larger persons because they dominate the attention maps, causing smaller persons to be missed. In hemispherical equirectangular panoramas, we find that apparent person height decreases approximately linearly with the vertical angle near the top of the image. Using this finding, we introduce panoramic distortion-aware tokenization to enhance the detection of small persons. This tokenization procedure divides panoramic features using self-similar figures that enable the determination of optimal divisions without gaps, and we leverage the maximum significance values in each tile of the token groups to preserve the significance areas of smaller persons. We propose a transformer-based person detection and localization method that combines panoramic-image remapping and the tokenization procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms conventional methods on large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Time-step Mixup for Efficient Spiking Knowledge Transfer from Appearance to Event Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12959v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives. These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Alzheimers Disease Progression Prediction Based on Manifold Mapping of Irregularly Sampled Longitudinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20154v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The uncertainty of clinical examinations frequently leads to irregular observation intervals in longitudinal imaging data, posing challenges for modeling disease progression.Most existing imaging-based disease prediction models operate in Euclidean space, which assumes a flat representation of data and fails to fully capture the intrinsic continuity and nonlinear geometric structure of irregularly sampled longitudinal images. To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability. Cross-dataset validation further confirms its robustness and applicability in diverse clinical settings.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures | None |

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</p></details> |  | None |

This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision. This will validate that the model can identify cardiomegaly and will also show the clinical significance of this method. The model has accuracy of 95.6, precision of 95.2, recall of 96.2, sensitivity of 95.7, specificity of 96.1 and an Area Under Curve(AUC) of 96.0 and their respective graphs are plotted for visualisation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explainable Visual Anomaly Detection via Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20088v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant attention due to its ability to identify anomalous images using only normal images during training. Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, performance degradation persists due to uneven illumination inherent in endoscopic images, particularly in low-intensity regions. Existing low-light enhancement techniques fail to effectively guide the depth network. Furthermore, solutions from other fields, like autonomous driving, require well-lit images, making them unsuitable and increasing data collection burdens. To this end, we present DeLight-Mono - a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework with illumination decoupling. Specifically, endoscopic images are represented by a designed illumination-reflectance-depth model, and are decomposed with auxiliary networks. Moreover, a self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel losses leveraging the decoupled components is proposed to mitigate the effects of uneven illumination on depth estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was rigorously verified through extensive comparisons and an ablation study performed on two public datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

This architecture enables highly efficient scaling (dramatically improving computational efficiency while significantly expanding model capacity) and empowers stronger unified multimodal intelligence across vision, speech, and language, representing a key step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to its predecessor, the upgraded version exhibits substantial improvements across multimodal understanding and generation. We significantly advance speech recognition capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in contextual ASR and highly competitive results in dialect-aware ASR. In image generation, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces high-fidelity text rendering and demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during image editing. Furthermore, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces generative segmentation, a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing consistency. Notably, Ming-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation and generative segmentation, and sets new records on all 12 contextual ASR benchmarks, all within a single unified architecture.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Dream-IF: Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent for Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10109v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion aims to integrate comprehensive information from images acquired through multiple sources. However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.

We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance. Further analysis confirms that explicit visual guidance plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step. Furthermore, a Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation module is introduced to capture sequential dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ACIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 70% and 89% on the JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the contribution of different modules of ACIT.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D settings. To alleviate these limitations, we propose TK-Mamba, a multimodal framework that fuses the linear-time Mamba with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to form an efficient hybrid backbone. Our approach is characterized by two primary technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce the novel 3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN), which marks the first application of KAN in 3D medical imaging, providing a superior and computationally efficient nonlinear feature transformation crucial for complex volumetric structures. Secondly, we devise a dual-branch text-driven strategy using Pubmedclip's embeddings. This strategy significantly enhances segmentation robustness and accuracy by simultaneously capturing inter-organ semantic relationships to mitigate label inconsistencies and aligning image features with anatomical texts. By combining this advanced backbone and vision-language knowledge, TK-Mamba offers a unified and scalable solution for both multi-organ and tumor segmentation. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both organ and tumor segmentation tasks, surpassing existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EmoFeedback2: Reinforcement of Continuous Emotional Image Generation via LVLM-based Reward and Textual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19982v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous emotional image generation (C-EICG) is emerging rapidly due to its ability to produce images aligned with both user descriptions and continuous emotional values. However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset.

However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels. We also construct HiCoPrompt, a new text-to-image benchmark with hierarchical prompts for rigorous evaluation. Experiments show our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both concept coverage and compositional accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

To address the challenge of acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision. We re-annotate mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs. In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward emphasizing potential manipulated regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Intelligent Image Search Algorithms Fusing Visual Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19920v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained image retrieval, which aims to find images containing specific object components and assess their detailed states, is critical in fields like security and industrial inspection. However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., "sun visor lowered"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., "driver wearing a mask") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines. It also attains 94.95\% accuracy in zero-shot search for driver mask-wearing and over 90\% average accuracy in state search tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages,7 figures | None |

Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality.

| **[InstaDA: Augmenting Instance Segmentation Data with Dual-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02973v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel, training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves. Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows, enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of +4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent categories.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[STAvatar: Soft Binding and Temporal Density Control for Monocular 3D Head Avatars Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19854v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing high-fidelity and animatable 3D head avatars from monocular videos remains a challenging yet essential task. Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | 17 pages, 14 figures | None |

In this paper, we take image generation as a representative application and propose a batch denoising framework, followed by a joint optimization of content generation and transmission, with the objective of maximizing the average AIGC service quality under an end-to-end service delay constraint. Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity. Building on the batch solution, we further optimize bandwidth allocation across AIGC services. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in delivering high-quality, lower-latency AIGC services.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[E$^{3}$NeRF: Efficient Event-Enhanced Neural Radiance Fields from Blurry Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01840v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieves impressive novel view rendering performance by learning implicit 3D representation from sparse view images. However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input that often occurs in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Efficient Event-Enhanced NeRF (E$^{3}$NeRF), reconstructing sharp NeRF by utilizing both blurry images and corresponding event streams. A blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss are introduced, which guide the NeRF training via modeling the physical image motion blur process and event generation process, respectively. To improve the efficiency of the framework, we further leverage the latent spatial-temporal blur information in the event stream to evenly distribute training over temporal blur and focus training on spatial blur. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of the events, generalizing the method to more practical applications. Compared to previous image-based and event-based NeRF works, our framework makes more profound use of the internal relationship between events and images. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E\textsuperscript{3}NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially for high-speed non-uniform motion and low-light scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we introduce CropVLM as an external low-cost method for boosting performance, enabling VLMs to dynamically ''zoom in'' on relevant image regions, enhancing their ability to capture fine details. CropVLM is trained using reinforcement learning, without using human-labeled bounding boxes as a supervision signal, and without expensive synthetic evaluations. The model is trained once and can be paired with both open-source and proprietary VLMs to improve their performance. Our approach delivers significant improvements on tasks that require high-resolution image understanding, notably for benchmarks that are out-of-domain for the target VLM, without modifying or fine-tuning the VLM, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-Free Generation of Diverse and High-Fidelity Images via Prompt Semantic Space Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19811v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image diversity remains a fundamental challenge for text-to-image diffusion models. Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | under review | None |

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization and few-shot capabilities across diverse visual domains. In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation datasets and domains show that VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Efficient Fuse-and-Refine for Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14698v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting have led to rapid improvements in efficient scene reconstruction from sparse views. However, most existing approaches construct Gaussian primitives directly aligned with the pixels in one or more of the input images. This leads to redundancies in the representation when input views overlap and constrains the position of the primitives to lie along the input rays without full flexibility in 3D space. Moreover, these pixel-aligned approaches do not naturally generalize to dynamic scenes, where effectively leveraging temporal information requires resolving both redundant and newly appearing content across frames. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Fuse-and-Refine module that enhances existing feed-forward models by merging and refining the primitives in a canonical 3D space. At the core of our method is an efficient hybrid Splat-Voxel representation: from an initial set of pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives, we aggregate local features into a coarse-to-fine voxel hierarchy, and then use a sparse voxel transformer to process these voxel features and generate refined Gaussian primitives. By fusing and refining an arbitrary number of inputs into a consistent set of primitives, our representation effectively reduces redundancy and naturally adapts to temporal frames, enabling history-aware online reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and streaming scene reconstructions while running at interactive rates (15 fps with 350ms delay) on a single H100 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, Previously titled "SplatVoxel: History-Aware Novel View Streaming without Temporal Training", Project Page: https://19reborn.github.io/SplatVoxel/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://19reborn.github.io/SplatVoxel) |

Although some AI models only perform well with large amounts of data, we will move to data augmentation where there is a solution to improve the performance of our models and increase the dataset size through traditional or advanced techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques on two different medical image datasets. In the first step, we applied some transformation techniques to the skin cancer dataset containing benign and malignant classes. Then, we trained the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the dataset before and after augmentation, which significantly improved test accuracy from 90.74% to 96.88% and decreased test loss from 0.7921 to 0.1468 after augmentation. In the second step, we used the Mixup technique by mixing two random images and their corresponding masks using the retina and blood vessels dataset, then we trained the U-net model and obtained the Dice coefficient which increased from 0 before augmentation to 0.4163 after augmentation. The result shows the effect of using data augmentation to increase the dataset size on the classification and segmentation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, small objects often remain difficult to detect from high altitudes due to low object-to-background pixel ratios. We propose an altitude-aware dynamic tiling method that scales and adaptively subdivides the image into tiles for enhanced small object detection. By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance. Tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset [1] with YOLOv5 [2] and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework [3], our approach improves Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% compared to a baseline and achieves more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling.

Employing an attention-based encoder-decoder backbone, it jointly segments four ROIs - masses, calcifications, axillary findings, and breast tissues - with state-of-the-art accuracy and robustly predicts ten structured clinical features: mass morphology, calcification type, ACR breast density, and BI-RADS categories. To fuse imaging and clinical insights, we developed two late-fusion strategies. By utilizing complementary multimodal data, late fusion strategies improve diagnostic precision and reduce inter-observer variability. Operationalized as a secure, user-friendly web application, OncoVision produces structured reports with dual-confidence scoring and attention-weighted visualizations for real-time diagnostic support to improve clinician trust and facilitate medical teaching. It can be easily incorporated into the clinic, making screening available in underprivileged areas around the world, such as rural South Asia. Combining accurate segmentation with clinical intuition, OncoVision raises the bar for AI-based mammography, offering a scalable and equitable solution to detect breast cancer at an earlier stage and enhancing treatment through timely interventions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On the Utility of Foundation Models for Fast MRI: Vision-Language-Guided Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19641v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To investigate whether a vision-language foundation model can enhance undersampled MRI reconstruction by providing high-level contextual information beyond conventional priors. Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework. Conclusion: The study highlights that vision-language foundation models can improve undersampled MRI reconstruction through semantic-space optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing Vision--Language Models (VLMs) struggle with generalization across heterogeneous platforms and lack precision in interface understanding and action execution. We introduce Yanyun-3, a VLM-based agent that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for visual reasoning and UI-TARS for interface execution. We propose a novel data organization principle -- combination granularity -- to distinguish intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing of multimodal data (static images, multi-image sequences, and videos). The model is fine-tuned using QLoRA on a curated dataset across three strategy game platforms. The optimal strategy (M*V+S) achieves a 12.98x improvement in BLEU-4 score and a 63% reduction in inference time compared to full fusion. Yanyun-3 successfully executes core tasks (e.g., target selection, resource allocation) across platforms without platform-specific tuning. Our findings demonstrate that structured multimodal data organization significantly enhances VLM performance in embodied tasks. Yanyun-3 offers a generalizable framework for GUI automation, with broader implications for robotics and autonomous systems.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures | None |

We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.</p></details> | technical report | None |

While recent CLIP-inspired methods attempt to leverage textual guidance for detection, they are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose DGSPNet, an end-to-end language prompt-driven framework. Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures | None |

We propose a novel densify beforehand approach that enhances the initialization of 3D scenes by combining sparse LiDAR data with monocular depth estimation from corresponding RGB images. Our ROI-aware sampling scheme prioritizes semantically and geometrically important regions, yielding a dense point cloud that improves visual fidelity and computational efficiency. This densify beforehand approach bypasses the adaptive density control that may introduce redundant Gaussians in the original pipeline, allowing the optimization to focus on the other attributes of 3D Gaussian primitives, reducing overlap while enhancing visual quality. Our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques while significantly lowering resource consumption and training time.

These include 1) input-level conflicts, where the conditioning image contradicts the text prompt, and 2) model-bias conflicts, where generative biases disrupt alignment even when conditions match the text. Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition. Experiments show BideDPO significantly improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and condition adherence. We also validate our approach using the COCO dataset.

However, existing methods struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention. Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in computer-assisted surgery (CAS).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to IPCAI 2025.

One subtle ability is to judge whether an image looks like a given object without being an instance of that object. We study whether vision-language models such as CLIP capture this distinction. We curated a dataset named RoLA (Real or Lookalike) of real and lookalike exemplars (e.g., toys, statues, drawings, pareidolia) across multiple categories, and first evaluate a prompt-based baseline with paired "real"/"lookalike" prompts. We then estimate a direction in CLIP's embedding space that moves representations between real and lookalike. Applying this direction to image and text embeddings improves discrimination in cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M, and also enhances captions produced by a CLIP prefix captioner.</p></details> |  | None |

To handle diverse unknown degradations, zero-shot IR methods have also been introduced. However, existing pre-trained and zero-shot IR approaches often fail to align with human preferences, resulting in restored images that may not be favored. This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed pipeline.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI26 | None |

However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

Although SAM is primarily trained on 2D images, attempts have been made to apply it to 3D medical image segmentation. However, the pseudo 3D processing used to adapt SAM results in spatial feature loss, limiting its performance. Additionally, most SAM-based methods still rely on manual prompts, which are challenging to implement in real-world scenarios and require extensive external expert knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce the Decoder Enhanced and Auto Prompt SAM (DEAP-3DSAM) to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we propose a Feature Enhanced Decoder that fuses the original image features with rich and detailed spatial information to enhance spatial features. We also design a Dual Attention Prompter to automatically obtain prompt information through Spatial Attention and Channel Attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four public abdominal tumor segmentation datasets. The results indicate that our DEAP-3DSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D image segmentation, outperforming or matching existing manual prompt methods. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BIBM 2024</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise. These two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic information to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to dynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant semantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the legitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's performance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose an alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the encryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method achieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak signalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.</p></details> |  | None |

Typical pre-trained models, notably Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), generate prompts directly at a single granularity level. However, this approach has two limitations: (1) Localizability, lacking mechanisms for autonomous region localization; (2) Scalability, limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability. It offers a unique granular computational perspective for prompt-free segmentation.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures | None |

Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA) |

Existing multi-scale approaches alleviate this issue by integrating hierarchical or hybrid features; however, they rely on fixed patch sizes and introduce redundant computation. To address these limitations, we propose Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT), a dynamic coarse-to-fine framework that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity. It comprises two key stages: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module, which assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to estimate suitable patch and window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module, which refines attention computation according to the selected granularity, enabling efficient and precise feature learning. Two learnable parameters, α and \b{eta}, are optimized end-to-end to balance global reasoning and local perception. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Introducing Visual Scenes and Reasoning: A More Realistic Benchmark for Spoken Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19005v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) consists of two sub-tasks: intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF). Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Rigorous evaluations on the widely-used MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that PFADSeg exhibits excellent performance, achieving an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its practical adoption is hindered by two critical limitations. First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of recent models. The benchmark effectively identifies the texture and structural preservation problems among current methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OMGSR: You Only Need One Mid-timestep Guidance for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08227v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) show promising potential in one-step Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Current one-step Real-ISR methods typically inject the low-quality (LQ) image latent representation at the start or end timestep of the DDPM scheduler. Recent studies have begun to note that the LQ image latent and the pre-trained noisy latent representations are intuitively closer at a mid-timestep. However, a quantitative analysis of these latent representations remains lacking. Considering these latent representations can be decomposed into signal and noise, we propose a method based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to pre-compute an average optimal mid-timestep for injection. To better approximate the pre-trained noisy latent representation, we further introduce the Latent Representation Refinement (LRR) loss via a LoRA-enhanced VAE encoder. We also fine-tune the backbone of the DDPM-based generative model using LoRA to perform one-step denoising at the average optimal mid-timestep. Based on these components, we present OMGSR, a GAN-based Real-ISR framework that employs a DDPM-based generative model as the generator and a DINOv3-ConvNeXt model with multi-level discriminator heads as the discriminator. We also propose the DINOv3-ConvNeXt DISTS (Dv3CD) loss, which is enhanced for structural perception at varying resolutions. Within the OMGSR framework, we develop OMGSR-S based on SD2.1-base. An ablation study confirms that our pre-computation strategy and LRR loss significantly improve the baseline. Comparative studies demonstrate that OMGSR-S achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.

Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations. To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both "where to go" and "where not to go." To be formal, we propose \textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision). This contrastive formulation transforms FM from a purely attractive, one-sided objective into a two-sided training signal, regularizing trajectory evolution and improving perceptual fidelity across datasets and backbones. On ImageNet-1K 256$\times$256, VeCoR yields 22\% and 35\% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, respectively, and achieves further FID gains (32\% relative) on MS-COCO text-to-image generation, demonstrating consistent improvements in stability, convergence, and image quality, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

To address this, we introduce TIGER (Text-Image Guided supEr-Resolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks this trade-off through a "text-first, image-later" paradigm. TIGER explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement: it first reconstructs precise text structures and uses them to guide full-image super-resolution. This ensures high fidelity and readability. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we present the UZ-ST (UltraZoom-Scene Text) dataset, the first Chinese scene text dataset with extreme zoom. Extensive experiments show TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing readability and image quality.</p></details> |  | None |

Although prompt learning has enabled a recent work named CLIP-ReID to achieve promising performance, the underlying mechanisms and the necessity of prompt learning remain unclear due to the absence of semantic labels in ReID tasks. In this work, we first analyze the role prompt learning in CLIP-ReID and identify its limitations. Based on our investigations, we propose a simple yet effective approach to adapt CLIP for supervised object Re-ID. Our approach directly fine-tunes the image encoder of CLIP using a prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) loss, eliminating the need for prompt learning. Experimental results on both person and vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared to CLIP-ReID. Furthermore, we extend our PCL-based CLIP fine-tuning approach to unsupervised scenarios, where we achieve state-of-the art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.</p></details> |  | None |

It has broad applications in traffic control, vehicle-vehicle communication, and vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. To address this task, we introduce Promptable 3D Detector (Pro3D), a novel detector design that leverages 2D detections as prompts. We build our Pro3D upon two key insights. First, compared to a typical 3D detector, a 2D detector is ``easier'' to train due to fewer loss terms and performs significantly better at localizing objects w.r.t 2D metrics. Second, once 2D detections precisely locate objects in the image, a 3D detector can focus on lifting these detections into 3D BEV, especially when fixed camera pose or scene geometry provide an informative prior. To encode and incorporate 2D detections, we explore three methods: (a) concatenating features from both 2D and 3D detectors, (b) attentively fusing 2D and 3D detector features, and (c) encoding properties of predicted 2D bounding boxes \{$x$, $y$, width, height, label\} and attentively fusing them with the 3D detector feature. Interestingly, the third method significantly outperforms the others, underscoring the effectiveness of 2D detections as prompts that offer precise object targets and allow the 3D detector to focus on lifting them into 3D. Pro3D is adaptable for use with a wide range of 2D and 3D detectors with minimal modifications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our Pro3D significantly enhances existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on two contemporary benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images, thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios. To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images), a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First, recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm, mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing dataset distillation methods perform well on balanced datasets, they struggle under long-tailed distributions, where imbalanced class frequencies induce biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates such as Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity. Extensive experiments on four long-tailed benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across varying degrees of class imbalance.Notably, our approach improves top-1 accuracy by 15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (Oral) | None |

Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging \textbf{D}epth awareness and \textbf{S}emantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic \textbf{Occ}upancy prediction (\textbf{DSOcc}). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated by non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make voxels aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Instead of enhancing feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods and achieves competitive performance on the SSCBench-KITTI-360 and Occ3D-nuScenes datasets.

| **[IAG: Input-aware Backdoor Attack on VLM-based Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09456v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly enhanced the visual grounding task, which involves locating objects in an image based on natural language queries. Despite these advancements, the security of VLM-based grounding systems has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper reveals a novel and realistic vulnerability: the first multi-target backdoor attack on VLM-based visual grounding. Unlike prior attacks that rely on static triggers or fixed targets, we propose IAG, a method that dynamically generates input-aware, text-guided triggers conditioned on any specified target object description to execute the attack. This is achieved through a text-conditioned UNet that embeds imperceptible target semantic cues into visual inputs while preserving normal grounding performance on benign samples. We further develop a joint training objective that balances language capability with perceptual reconstruction to ensure imperceptibility, effectiveness, and stealth. Extensive experiments on multiple VLMs (e.g., LLaVA, InternVL, Ferret) and benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, Flickr30k Entities, and ShowUI) demonstrate that IAG achieves the best ASRs compared with other baselines on almost all settings without compromising clean accuracy, maintaining robustness against existing defenses, and exhibiting transferability across datasets and models. These findings underscore critical security risks in grounding-capable VLMs and highlight the need for further research on trustworthy multimodal understanding.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 Figures | None |

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a popular and effective technique for improving text-image alignment in the generative process. However, CFG introduces significant computational overhead. In this paper, we present DIstilling CFG by sharpening text Embeddings (DICE) that replaces CFG in the sampling process with half the computational complexity while maintaining similar generation quality. DICE distills a CFG-based text-to-image diffusion model into a CFG-free version by refining text embeddings to replicate CFG-based directions. In this way, we avoid the computational drawbacks of CFG, enabling high-quality, well-aligned image generation at a fast sampling speed. Furthermore, examining the enhancement pattern, we identify the underlying mechanism of DICE that sharpens specific components of text embeddings to preserve semantic information while enhancing fine-grained details. Extensive experiments on multiple Stable Diffusion v1.5 variants, SDXL, and PixArt-$α$ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g., energy or entropy)--for this pixel-precise task. However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time. Our results demonstrate that SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key evaluation metrics, including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

Building on this capability, existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods have adapted the NeRF model and its variants for internal CT reconstruction. However, these approaches often neglect the significance of objects' anatomical priors for implicit learning, limiting both reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, particularly in ultra-sparse view scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning. Our approach integrates positional and structural encoding to facilitate voxel-wise implicit reconstruction, utilizing the target prior to guide voxel sampling and enrich structural encoding. This dual strategy significantly boosts both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid estimation of high-quality 3D target priors from sparse-view projections. Experiments utilizing projection data from a complex abdominal dataset demonstrate that the proposed model substantially enhances learning efficiency, outperforming the current leading model, NAF, by a factor of ten. In terms of reconstruction quality, it also exceeds the most accurate model, NeRP, achieving PSNR improvements of 3.57 dB, 5.42 dB, and 5.70 dB with 10, 20, and 30 projections, respectively.

However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion.

While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.</p></details> |  | None |

While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages (including references and supplementary material), 10 figures, 7 tables.

| **[Unsupervised Multi-View Visual Anomaly Detection via Progressive Homography-Guided Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18766v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.</p></details> |  | None |

Unpaired enhancement pipelines are typically GAN-based, however, they can distort clinically critical vasculature, altering vessel topology and endpoint integrity. Motivated by these structural alterations, we propose Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport (\textbf{VAOT}), a framework that combines an optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: (i) a skeleton-based loss to maintain global vascular connectivity and (ii) an endpoint-aware loss to stabilize local termini. These constraints guide learning in the unpaired setting, reducing noise while preserving vessel structure. Experimental results on synthetic degradation benchmark and downstream evaluations in vessel and lesion segmentation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods against several state-of-the art baselines.

In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[ProxT2I: Efficient Reward-Guided Text-to-Image Generation via Proximal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18742v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal Large Language Models with Adaptive Preference Optimization for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18740v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for sequential recommendation by enabling natural language reasoning over user behavior sequences. A common approach formulates recommendation as a language modeling task, where interaction histories are transformed into prompts and user preferences are learned via supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods operate solely in the textual modality and often miss users' fine-grained interests, especially when shaped by rich visual signals such as product images or movie posters. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by aligning text and vision in a shared semantic space. A prevalent training paradigm applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to model user preferences. Yet, two core challenges remain: 1) Imbalanced sample hardness, where random negative sampling causes overfitting on easy examples and under-training on hard ones; 2) Cross-modal semantic bias, where the fixed reference model in DPO prevents the policy model from correcting modality misalignments--especially over long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a Multimodal LLM framework that integrates Hardness-aware and Noise-regularized preference optimization for Recommendation (HaNoRec). Specifically, HaNoRec dynamically adjusts optimization weights based on both the estimated hardness of each training sample and the policy model's real-time responsiveness, prioritizing harder examples. It further introduces Gaussian-perturbed distribution optimization on output logits to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency and reduce modality bias inherited from the reference model.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures | None |

Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., canny edge) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning-based approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. Through an empirical analysis of existing methods, we identify a key limitation: the sampling schedule of condition features, previously unexplored, fails to account for the evolving interplay between structure preservation and domain alignment throughout diffusion steps. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible training-free framework that decouples the sampling schedule of condition features from the denoising process, and systematically investigate the spectrum of feature injection schedules for a higher-quality structure guidance in the feature space. Specifically, we find that condition features sampled from a single timestep are sufficient, yielding a simple yet efficient schedule that balances structure alignment and appearance quality. We further enhance the sampling process by introducing a restart refinement schedule, and improve the visual quality with an appearance-rich prompting strategy. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we propose ERANet, an innovative semi-supervised framework for meniscus segmentation that effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled images through advanced augmentation and learning strategies. ERANet integrates three key components: edge replacement augmentation (ERA), prototype consistency alignment (PCA), and a conditional self-training (CST) strategy within a mean teacher architecture. ERA introduces anatomically relevant perturbations by simulating meniscal variations, ensuring that augmentations align with the structural context. PCA enhances segmentation performance by aligning intra-class features and promoting compact, discriminative feature representations, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. CST improves segmentation robustness by iteratively refining pseudo-labels and mitigating the impact of label noise during training. Together, these innovations establish ERANet as a robust and scalable solution for meniscus segmentation, effectively addressing key barriers to practical implementation. We validated ERANet comprehensively on 3D Double Echo Steady State (DESS) and 3D Fast/Turbo Spin Echo (FSE/TSE) MRI sequences. The results demonstrate the superior performance of ERANet compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework achieves reliable and accurate segmentation of meniscus structures, even when trained on minimal labeled data. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the synergistic contributions of ERA, PCA, and CST, solidifying ERANet as a transformative solution for semi-supervised meniscus segmentation in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models.

Efficiently processing unstructured point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a significant challenge. In recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based representation methods have emerged to balance efficiency and performance by fusing 3D point clouds with 2D grids. However, the fundamental inconsistency between the pseudo-image representation and the original 3D information critically undermines 2D-3D feature fusion, posing a primary obstacle for coherent information fusion and leading to poor feature discriminability. This work proposes DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation framework designed to extract discriminative features. It incorporates three key components: first, a Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding (GL-FFE) module to enhance intra-set local feature correlation and capture global contextual information; second, a Multi-Branch Feature Extraction (MB-FE) network to capture richer neighborhood information and improve the discriminability of contour features; and third, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention (FFDFA) mechanism to refine cross-channel feature fusion precision. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DAGLFNet achieves mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores of 69.9% and 78.7% on the validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method achieves an excellent balance between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 6 figures</p></details> | None |

Compared to 3D representations like voxels and point clouds, mesh-based representations are preferred as they enable the application of differential geometry theory and are optimized for modern graphics pipelines. However, existing inverse rendering methods often fail catastrophically on high-genus surfaces, leading to the loss of key topological features, and tend to oversmooth low-genus surfaces, resulting in the loss of surface details. This failure stems from their overreliance on Adam-based optimizers, which can lead to vanishing and exploding gradients. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an adaptive V-cycle remeshing scheme in conjunction with a re-parametrized Adam optimizer to enhance topological and geometric awareness. By periodically coarsening and refining the deforming mesh, our method informs mesh vertices of their current topology and geometry before optimization, mitigating gradient issues while preserving essential topological features. Additionally, we enforce topological consistency by constructing topological primitives with genus numbers that match those of ground truth using Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Experimental results demonstrate that our inverse rendering approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and Volume IoU, particularly for high-genus surfaces, while also enhancing surface details for low-genus surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>3DV20...</summary><p>3DV2026 Accepted (Poster)</p></details> | None |
| **[A Theory-Inspired Framework for Few-Shot Cross-Modal Sketch Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18677v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketch based person re-identification aims to match hand-drawn sketches with RGB surveillance images, but remains challenging due to significant modality gaps and limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce KTCAA, a theoretically grounded framework for few-shot cross-modal generalization. Motivated by generalization theory, we identify two key factors influencing target domain risk: (1) domain discrepancy, which quantifies the alignment difficulty between source and target distributions; and (2) perturbation invariance, which evaluates the model's robustness to modality shifts. Based on these insights, we propose two components: (1) Alignment Augmentation (AA), which applies localized sketch-style transformations to simulate target distributions and facilitate progressive alignment; and (2) Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (KTC), which enhances invariance by introducing worst-case perturbations and enforcing consistency. These modules are jointly optimized under a meta-learning paradigm that transfers alignment knowledge from data-rich RGB domains to sketch-based scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KTCAA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 | None |

However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging.

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the "fake" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence - 2025</p></details> | None |

To address data leakage issues in existing benchmarks, we digitized all 46 questions (22 common and 24 elective) within two hours of the exam's public release, eliminating any possibility of inclusion in model training data. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs across varying input modalities (text, image, text+figure) and prompt languages (Korean, English). GPT-5 Codex achieved the only perfect score (100 points) with text input and Korean prompts, while Grok 4, GPT-5, and Deepseek R1 scored above 95 points. Notably, gpt-oss-20B achieved 95.7 points despite its relatively small size, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Problem-specific analysis revealed geometry as the weakest domain (77.7% average) with significant performance degradation on 4-point high-difficulty problems. Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale. In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (from 82.6 to 100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a real-exam-based LLM assessment framework, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations. Detailed results and model comparisons are available at the 2026 Korean CSAT LLM Evaluation Leaderboard (https://isoft.cnu.ac.kr/csat2026/).</p></details> | 52 pages, Korean | None |

In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings. On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data. Probabilistic calibration using GUESS enabled threshold-independent decision support for future clinical implementation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often rely on paired data or fail to model dynamic illumination and blur characteristics, leading to poor generalization. To tackle this, we propose a generative framework based on visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, guided by perceptual priors from the vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, to supply informative conditioning cues for VAR models, we deploy an adaptive curve estimation scheme to modulate the diverse illumination based on VLM-derived visibility scores. In addition, we integrate dynamic and spatial-frequency-aware Rotary Positional Encodings (SF-RoPE) into VAR to enhance its ability to model structures degraded by blur. Furthermore, we propose a recursive phase-domain modulation strategy that mitigates blur-induced artifacts in the phase domain via bounded iterative refinement guided by VLM-assessed blur scores. Our framework is fully unsupervised and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026; First Var-based method for joint LLIE and deblurring</p></details> | None |

Simulations provide galaxy images with ground-truth physical labels, but domain shifts in PSF, noise, backgrounds, selection, and label priors degrade transfer to real surveys. We present a preliminary domain adaptation pipeline that trains on simulated TNG50 galaxies and evaluates on real SDSS galaxies with morphology labels (elliptical/spiral/irregular). We train three backbones (CNN, $E(2)$-steerable CNN, ResNet-18) with focal loss and effective-number class weighting, and a feature-level domain loss $L_D$ built from GeomLoss (entropic Sinkhorn OT, energy distance, Gaussian MMD, and related metrics). We show that a combination of these losses with an OT-based "top_$k$ soft matching" loss that focuses $L_D$ on the worst-matched source-target pairs can further enhance domain alignment. With Euclidean distance, scheduled alignment weights, and top-$k$ matching, target accuracy (macro F1) rises from $\sim$46% ($\sim$30%) at no adaptation to $\sim$87% ($\sim$62.6%), with a domain AUC near 0.5, indicating strong latent-space mixing.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[LRDUN: A Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network for Efficient Spectral Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18513v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have achieved remarkable success and become the mainstream paradigm for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction. Existing DUNs are derived from full-HSI imaging models, where each stage operates directly on the high-dimensional HSI, refining the entire data cube based on the single 2D coded measurement. However, this paradigm leads to computational redundancy and suffers from the ill-posed nature of mapping 2D residuals back to 3D space of HSI. In this paper, we propose two novel imaging models corresponding to the spectral basis and subspace image by explicitly integrating low-rank (LR) decomposition with the sensing model. Compared to recovering the full HSI, estimating these compact low-dimensional components significantly mitigates the ill-posedness. Building upon these novel models, we develop the Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network (LRDUN), which jointly solves the two subproblems within an unfolded proximal gradient descent (PGD) framework. Furthermore, we introduce a Generalized Feature Unfolding Mechanism (GFUM) that decouples the physical rank in the data-fidelity term from the feature dimensionality in the prior module, enhancing the representational capacity and flexibility of the network. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed LRDUN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality with significantly reduced computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 16 figures,</p></details> | None |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification in HSI Reconstruction using Physics-Aware Diffusion Priors and Optics-Encoded Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18473v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image reconstruction from a compressed measurement is a highly ill-posed inverse problem. Current data-driven methods suffer from hallucination due to the lack of spectral diversity in existing hyperspectral image datasets, particularly when they are evaluated for the metamerism phenomenon. In this work, we formulate hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a framework, HSDiff, that utilizes an unconditionally trained, pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling to generate diverse HSI samples consistent with the measurements of various hyperspectral image formation models. We propose an enhanced metameric augmentation technique using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling to expand training with physically valid metameric spectra, strengthening the prior diversity and improving uncertainty calibration. We utilize HSDiff to investigate how the studied forward models shape the posterior distribution and demonstrate that guiding with effective spectral encoding provides calibrated informative uncertainty compared to non-encoded models. Through the lens of the Bayesian framework, HSDiff offers a complete, high-performance method for uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction. Our results also reiterate the significance of effective spectral encoding in snapshot hyperspectral imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the precision of depth estimation using stereoscopic methods depends on the accurate calibration of binocular vision sensors. Monocular cameras, while more accessible, often suffer from reduced accuracy, especially under challenging imaging conditions. Optical sensors, too, face limitations in adverse environments, leading researchers to explore radar technology as a reliable alternative. Although radar provides coarse but accurate signals, its integration with fine-grained monocular camera data remains underexplored. In this research, we propose DepthSense, a novel radar-assisted monocular depth enhancement approach. DepthSense employs an encoder-decoder architecture, a Radar Residual Network, feature fusion with a spatial attention mechanism, and an ordinal regression layer to deliver precise depth estimations. We conducted extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to validate the effectiveness of DepthSense. Our methodology not only surpasses existing approaches in quantitative performance but also reduces parameter complexity and inference times. Our findings demonstrate that DepthSense represents a significant advancement over traditional stereo methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for depth estimation in autonomous driving. By leveraging the complementary strengths of radar and monocular camera data, DepthSense sets a new benchmark in the field, paving the way for more reliable and accurate spatial perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, contemporary VLMs produce details that are inadequately aligned with the objectives of disaster assessment, primarily due to their deficiency in domain knowledge and the absence of a more refined descriptive process. This research presents the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a dedicated multimodal framework aimed at integrating external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to improve the captioning process. The objective is to produce disaster-specific descriptions that effectively convert raw visual data into actionable intelligence. VLCE utilizes two separate architectures: a CNN-LSTM model that incorporates a ResNet50 backbone, pretrained on EuroSat for satellite imagery (xBD dataset), and a Vision Transformer developed for UAV imagery (RescueNet dataset). In various architectural frameworks and datasets, VLCE exhibits a consistent advantage over baseline models such as LLaVA and QwenVL. Our optimal configuration reaches an impressive 95.33\% on InfoMetIC for UAV imagery while also demonstrating strong performance across satellite imagery. The proposed framework signifies a significant transition from basic visual classification to the generation of comprehensive situational intelligence, demonstrating immediate applicability for implementation in real-time disaster assessment systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures, 3 algorithms</p></details> | None |

This task requires accurate rendering of complex scenes containing multiple objects that exhibit diverse attributes as well as intricate spatial and semantic relationships, demanding both precise object placement and coherent inter-object interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel compositional curriculum reinforcement learning framework named CompGen that addresses compositional weakness in existing T2I models. Specifically, we leverage scene graphs to establish a novel difficulty criterion for compositional ability and develop a corresponding adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo graph sampling algorithm. This difficulty-aware approach enables the synthesis of training curriculum data that progressively optimize T2I models through reinforcement learning. We integrate our curriculum learning approach into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and investigate different curriculum scheduling strategies. Our experiments reveal that CompGen exhibits distinct scaling curves under different curriculum scheduling strategies, with easy-to-hard and Gaussian sampling strategies yielding superior scaling performance compared to random sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompGen significantly enhances compositional generation capabilities for both diffusion-based and auto-regressive T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving the compositional T2I generation systems.</p></details> |  | None |

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages,10 Figures, Project Website: https://idealistxy.github.io/Uni-MoE-v2.github.io/ Codes: https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/Uni-MoE</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/Uni-MoE) |

However, users still struggle to obtain content that aligns with their preferences due to the difficulty of crafting detailed prompts and the lack of mechanisms to retain their preferences. To address these challenges, we construct \textbf{UniPrefer-100K}, a large-scale dataset comprising images, videos, and associated text that describes the styles users tend to prefer. Based on UniPrefer-100K, we propose \textbf{MagicWand}, a universal generation and evaluation agent that enhances prompts based on user preferences, leverages advanced generation models for high-quality content, and applies preference-aligned evaluation and refinement. In addition, we introduce \textbf{UniPreferBench}, the first large-scale benchmark with over 120K annotations for assessing user preference alignment across diverse AIGC tasks. Experiments on UniPreferBench demonstrate that MagicWand consistently generates content and evaluations that are well aligned with user preferences across a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnyExperts: On-Demand Expert Allocation for Multimodal Language Models with Mixture of Expert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18314v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer a promising path toward scalable and efficient large vision-language systems. However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%. These results demonstrate that fine-grained, importance-driven expert allocation significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal MoE models.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. Our approach addresses this critical gap by providing a systematic framework for generating spatially coherent data. In this work, we introduce SKG2DATA, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2DATA employs an automated pipeline for constructing Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) that effectively captures human-like spatial cognition, including directional and distance relationships. These structured representations then serve as precise guidance for our integrated synthesis pipeline, where a diffusion model generates spatially-consistent images while a MLLM produces corresponding textual descriptions. The automated construction of SKG enables scalable generation of diverse yet realistic spatial configurations, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs markedly, albeit with a slight cost to their general capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence.

Both traditional prior-based approaches and deep learning-based methods have been used to address this problem. However, the inflexible assumption of the former often impairs their effectiveness in handling diverse underwater scenes, while the generalization of the latter to unseen images is usually weakened by insufficient data. In this study, we leverage both the physics-based Image Formation Model (IFM) and deep learning techniques for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE). To this end, we propose a novel Physics-Aware Triple-Stream Underwater Image Enhancement Network, i.e., PATS-UIENet, which comprises a Direct Signal Transmission Estimation Stream (D-Stream), a Backscatter Signal Transmission Estimation Stream (B-Stream) and an Ambient Light Estimation Stream (A-Stream). This network fulfills the UIE task by explicitly estimating the degradation parameters of a revised IFM. We also adopt an IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework, which exploits both the labeled and unlabeled images, to address the issue of insufficient data. To our knowledge, such a physics-aware deep network and the IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework have not been used for the UIE task before. Our method performs better than, or at least comparably to, sixteen baselines across four testing sets in the degradation estimation and UIE tasks. These promising results should be due to the fact that the proposed method can not only model the degradation but also learn the characteristics of diverse underwater scenes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[A Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework with PKCP-MixUp Augmentation for Pediatric Liver Tumor Diagnosis Using Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19478v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pediatric liver tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatrics, with differentiation of benign or malignant status and pathological classification critical for clinical treatment. While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses. This framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides actionable insights for CT phase selection and model design, and paves the way for precise, accessible pediatric liver tumor diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Virtual Follow-up LDCT Generation via Correlational Autoencoder and Latent Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18185v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and early diagnosis is critical because the survival rate declines sharply once the disease progresses to advanced stages. However, achieving an early diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in distinguishing subtle early signals of malignancy from those of benign conditions. In clinical practice, a patient with a high risk may need to undergo an initial baseline and several annual follow-up examinations (e.g., CT scans) before receiving a definitive diagnosis, which can result in missing the optimal treatment. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used for early diagnosis of lung cancer, but most existing algorithms focus on radiomic features extraction from single early-stage CT scans. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, this paper proposes a generative method, named CorrFlowNet, which creates a virtual, one-year follow-up CT scan after the initial baseline scan. This virtual follow-up would allow for an early detection of malignant/benign nodules, reducing the need to wait for clinical follow-ups. During training, our approach employs a correlational autoencoder to encode both early baseline and follow-up CT images into a latent space that captures the dynamics of nodule progression as well as the correlations between them, followed by a flow matching algorithm on the latent space with a neural ordinary differential equation. An auxiliary classifier is used to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Evaluations on a real clinical dataset show our method can significantly improve downstream lung nodule risk assessment compared with existing baseline models. Moreover, its diagnostic accuracy is comparable with real clinical CT follow-ups, highlighting its potential to improve cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Nested Unfolding Network for Real-World Concealed Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18164v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.</p></details> | 6 figures, 14 tables | None |
| **[UnfoldLDM: Deep Unfolding-based Blind Image Restoration with Latent Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18152v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.</p></details> | 6 figures, 11 tables | None |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

We study ObAct on a dual-arm robotic system equipped with wrist-mounted cameras. At test time, ObAct dynamically assigns observer and actor roles: the observer arm constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation from three images, virtually explores this to find an optimal camera pose, then moves to this pose; the actor arm then executes a policy using the observer's observations. This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies. We study this formulation with two existing imitation learning methods -- trajectory transfer and behavior cloning -- and experiments show that ObAct significantly outperforms static-camera setups: trajectory transfer improves by 145% without occlusion and 233% with occlusion, while behavior cloning improves by 75% and 143%, respectively.

However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions. Code will be released.</p></details> | 4 figures, 6 tables | None |

This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on complex auxiliary inputs such as body parsing and warped mask or require finely designed extract branches to process various input conditions, RefTON streamlines the process by directly generating try-on results from a source image and a target garment, without the need for structural guidance or auxiliary components to handle diverse inputs. Moreover, inspired by human clothing selection behavior, RefTON leverages additional reference images (the target garment worn on different individuals) to provide powerful guidance for refining texture alignment and maintaining the garment details. To enable this capability, we built a dataset containing unpaired reference images for training. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that RefTON achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a simple and efficient person-to-person design.</p></details> |  | None |

Early detection is essential to prevent progression to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology, with potential applications in screening workflows, education, and low-resource settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate IE-Critic-R1's superior subjective-alignments on the text-driven image editing task compared with previous metrics.

A primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues, and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable, leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views. To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance while requiring fewer training resources.

However, existing approaches mainly focus on directly enhancing the final resolution, often neglecting effective control over error propagation and accumulation during intermediate stages. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising approach that can represent the entire reconstruction process as a state sequence with multiple nodes, allowing for intermediate intervention. Nonetheless, its fixed linear mapper is limited by a narrow receptive field and restricted flexibility, which hampers its effectiveness in fine-grained images. To address this, we created a nonlinear state predictive control model \textbf{MambaX} that maps consecutive spectral bands into a latent state space and generalizes the SR task by dynamically learning the nonlinear state parameters of control equations. Compared to existing sequence models, MambaX 1) employs dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate the nonlinear differential coefficients of state-space models; 2) introduces a novel state cross-control paradigm for multimodal SR fusion; and 3) utilizes progressive transitional learning to mitigate heterogeneity caused by domain and modality shifts. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the dynamic spectrum-state representation model in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, highlighting its substantial potential to advance spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

Despite recent progress, two critical challenges persist in this setting. First, existing semantic prototypes, even when enriched by LLMs, are static and limited, failing to capture the rich intra-class visual variations induced by different object states (e.g., a cat's pose). Second, the standard pseudo-box generation introduces a semantic mismatch between visual region proposals (which contain context) and object-centric text embeddings. To tackle these issues, we introduce two complementary prototype enhancement strategies. To capture intra-class variations in appearance and state, we propose the State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP), which generates state-aware textual descriptions (e.g., "a sleeping cat") to capture diverse object appearances, yielding more discriminative prototypes. Building on this, we further introduce Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) to address the semantic mismatch. SAPP incorporates contextual semantics (e.g., "cat lying on sofa") and utilizes a soft alignment mechanism to promote contextually consistent visual-textual representations. By integrating SESP and SAPP, our method effectively enhances both the richness of semantic prototypes and the visual-textual alignment, achieving notable improvements.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, a novel approach inspired by multi-stage image restoration is proposed, incorporating Point Spread Function (PSF) mechanisms to reveal the image degradation process while combining dynamic physical modeling with sequential feature fusion transfer, named SD-PSFNet. Specifically, SD-PSFNet employs a sequential restoration architecture with three cascaded stages, allowing multiple dynamic evaluations and refinements of the degradation process estimation. The network utilizes components with learned PSF mechanisms to dynamically simulate rain streak optics, enabling effective rain-background separation while progressively enhancing outputs through novel PSF components at each stage. Additionally, SD-PSFNet incorporates adaptive gated fusion for optimal cross-stage feature integration, enabling sequential refinement from coarse rain removal to fine detail restoration. Our model achieves state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM metrics on Rain100H (33.12dB/0.9371), RealRain-1k-L (42.28dB/0.9872), and RealRain-1k-H (41.08dB/0.9838). In summary, SD-PSFNet demonstrates excellent capability in complex scenes and dense rainfall conditions, providing a new physics-aware approach to image deraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, Published in AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.</p></details> |  | None |

Models such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure, explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts.

With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

Existing In-Context-Learning based methods are limited by their highly coupled training paradigm. These methods attempt to achieve both high subject fidelity and multi-dimensional human preference alignment within a single training stage, relying on a single, indirect reconstruction loss, which is difficult to simultaneously satisfy both these goals. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a framework that decouples this task into two distinct training stages. First, in a pre-training stage, we introduce an explicit positional supervision mechanism that effectively resolves attention bleeding and drastically enhances subject fidelity. Second, in a post-training stage, we propose Identity-Preserving Preference Optimization, a novel online reinforcement learning framework. We feature a scoring mechanism to accurately assess multi-subject fidelity based on the Hungarian matching algorithm, which allows the model to optimize for aesthetics and prompt alignment while ensuring subject fidelity achieved in the first stage. Experiments validate that our decoupling framework significantly improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wutao-cs.github.io/MultiCrafter/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wutao-cs.github.io/MultiCrafter) |

While prior works address this problem through either text-guided image manipulation or video prediction, these tasks are typically treated in isolation. This separation reveals a fundamental issue: image manipulation methods overlook how actions unfold over time, while video prediction models often ignore the intended outcomes. To this end, we propose ShowMe, a unified framework that enables both tasks by selectively activating the spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models. In addition, we introduce structure and motion consistency rewards to improve structural fidelity and temporal coherence. Notably, this unification brings dual benefits: the spatial knowledge gained through video pretraining enhances contextual consistency and realism in non-rigid image edits, while the instruction-guided manipulation stage equips the model with stronger goal-oriented reasoning for video prediction. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms expert models in both instructional image and video generation, highlighting the strength of video diffusion models as a unified action-object state transformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability "look" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination.

While deepfake detection has been extensively studied in facial contexts, satellite imagery presents distinct challenges, including terrain-level inconsistencies and structural artifacts. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for detecting AI-generated satellite images. Using a curated dataset of over 130,000 labeled RGB images from the DM-AER and FSI datasets, we show that ViTs significantly outperform CNNs in both accuracy (95.11 percent vs. 87.02 percent) and overall robustness, owing to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global semantic structures. We further enhance model transparency using architecture-specific interpretability methods, including Grad-CAM for CNNs and Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs, revealing distinct detection behaviors and validating model trustworthiness. Our results highlight the ViT's superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns characteristic of synthetic imagery. Future work will extend this research to multispectral and SAR modalities and integrate frequency-domain analysis to further strengthen detection capabilities and safeguard satellite imagery integrity in high-stakes applications.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[CORA: Consistency-Guided Semi-Supervised Framework for Reasoning Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17755v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation seeks pixel-accurate masks for targets referenced by complex, often implicit instructions, requiring context-dependent reasoning over the scene. Recent multimodal language models have advanced instruction following segmentation, yet generalization remains limited. The key bottleneck is the high cost of curating diverse, high-quality pixel annotations paired with rich linguistic supervision leading to brittle performance under distribution shift. Therefore, we present CORA, a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that jointly learns from limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. CORA introduces three main components: 1) conditional visual instructions that encode spatial and contextual relationships between objects; 2) a noisy pseudo-label filter based on the consistency of Multimodal LLM's outputs across semantically equivalent queries; and 3) a token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to enhance feature consistency. These components enable CORA to perform robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings. CORA achieves state-of-the-art results, requiring as few as 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, a benchmark dataset for urban scene understanding, surpassing the baseline by $+2.3\%$. Similarly, CORA improves performance by $+2.4\%$ with only 180 labeled images on PanNuke, a histopathology dataset.</p></details> | WACV 2026 accepted | None |
| **[AngioDG: Interpretable Channel-informed Feature-modulated Single-source Domain Generalization for Coronary Vessel Segmentation in X-ray Angiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17724v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with X-ray Coronary Angiography (XCA) as the gold standard during real-time cardiac interventions. Segmentation of coronary vessels from XCA can facilitate downstream quantitative assessments, such as measurement of the stenosis severity and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models for XCA is challenging due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics that cause domain shifts. These limitations are exacerbated by the lack of annotated datasets, making Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) a necessary solution for achieving generalization. Existing SDG methods are largely augmentation-based, which may not guarantee the mitigation of overfitting to augmented or synthetic domains. We propose a novel approach, ``AngioDG", to bridge this gap by channel regularization strategy to promote generalization. Our method identifies the contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics for DG, facilitating interpretability, and then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones. We evaluate AngioDG on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessels segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among the compared methods, while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Adversarial Transferability through Block Stretch and Shrink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17688v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks introduce small, deliberately crafted perturbations that mislead neural networks, and their transferability from white-box to black-box target models remains a critical research focus. Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments.</p></details> | code will be releace | None |
| **[Dual-Path Knowledge-Augmented Contrastive Alignment Network for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17685v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Oral, extended version</p></details> | None |
