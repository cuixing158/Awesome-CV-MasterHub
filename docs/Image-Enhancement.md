Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TiViBench: Benchmarking Think-in-Video Reasoning for Video Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13704v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of video generative models has shifted their focus from producing visually plausible outputs to tackling tasks requiring physical plausibility and logical consistency. However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://haroldchen19.github.io/TiViBench-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://haroldchen19.github.io/TiViBench-Page) |
| **[Crossing Borders: A Multimodal Challenge for Indian Poetry Translation and Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13689v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, has a rich and varied heritage spanning thousands of years. However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BIOMERO 2.0: end-to-end FAIR infrastructure for bioimaging data import, analysis, and provenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13611v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present BIOMERO 2.0, a major evolution of the BIOMERO framework that transforms OMERO into a FAIR-compliant (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), provenance-aware bioimaging platform. BIOMERO 2.0 integrates data import, preprocessing, analysis, and workflow monitoring through an OMERO.web plugin and containerized components. The importer subsystem facilitates in-place import using containerized preprocessing and metadata enrichment via forms, while the analyzer subsystem coordinates and tracks containerized analyses on high-performance computing systems via the BIOMERO Python library. All imports and analyses are recorded with parameters, versions, and results, ensuring real-time provenance accessible through integrated dashboards. This dual approach places OMERO at the heart of the bioimaging analysis process: the importer ensures provenance from image acquisition through preprocessing and import into OMERO, while the analyzer records it for downstream processing. These integrated layers enhance OMEROs FAIRification, supporting traceable, reusable workflows for image analysis that bridge the gap between data import, analysis, and sharing.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 25 pages supplemental information; for software, see https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO) |
| **[AtlasMorph: Learning conditional deformable templates for brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13609v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable templates, or atlases, are images that represent a prototypical anatomy for a population, and are often enhanced with probabilistic anatomical label maps. They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ICLR: Inter-Chrominance and Luminance Interaction for Natural Color Restoration in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13607v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) task aims at improving contrast while restoring details and textures for images captured in low-light conditions. HVI color space has made significant progress in this task by enabling precise decoupling of chrominance and luminance. However, for the interaction of chrominance and luminance branches, substantial distributional differences between the two branches prevalent in natural images limit complementary feature extraction, and luminance errors are propagated to chrominance channels through the nonlinear parameter. Furthermore, for interaction between different chrominance branches, images with large homogeneous-color regions usually exhibit weak correlation between chrominance branches due to concentrated distributions. Traditional pixel-wise losses exploit strong inter-branch correlations for co-optimization, causing gradient conflicts in weakly correlated regions. Therefore, we propose an Inter-Chrominance and Luminance Interaction (ICLR) framework including a Dual-stream Interaction Enhancement Module (DIEM) and a Covariance Correction Loss (CCL). The DIEM improves the extraction of complementary information from two dimensions, fusion and enhancement, respectively. The CCL utilizes luminance residual statistics to penalize chrominance errors and balances gradient conflicts by constraining chrominance branches covariance. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed ICLR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-26 | None |
| **[Power Homotopy for Zeroth-Order Non-Convex Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13592v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GS-PowerHP, a novel zeroth-order method for non-convex optimization problems of the form $\max_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)$. Our approach leverages two key components: a power-transformed Gaussian-smoothed surrogate $F_{N,σ}(μ) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{N}(μ,σ^2 I_d)}[e^{N f(x)}]$ whose stationary points cluster near the global maximizer $x^*$ of $f$ for sufficiently large $N$, and an incrementally decaying $σ$ for enhanced data efficiency. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence in expectation to a small neighborhood of $x^*$ with the iteration complexity of $O(d^2 \varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirical results show our approach consistently ranks among the top three across a suite of competing algorithms. Its robustness is underscored by the final experiment on a substantially high-dimensional problem ($d=150,528$), where it achieved first place on least-likely targeted black-box attacks against images from ImageNet, surpassing all competing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Multi-Scale Integration Unlocks Robust Cell Annotation in Histopathology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13586v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying cell types and subtypes from routine histopathology images is essential for improving the computational understanding of human disease. Existing tile-based models can capture detailed nuclear morphology but often fail to incorporate the broader tissue context that influences a cell's function and identity. In addition, available human annotations are typically coarse-grained and unevenly distributed across studies, making fine-grained subtype-level supervision difficult to obtain. To address these limitations, we introduce NuClass, a pathologist workflow inspired framework for cell-wise multi-scale integration of nuclear morphology and microenvironmental context. NuClass includes two main components: Path local, which focuses on nuclear morphology from 224-by-224 pixel crops, and Path global, which models the surrounding 1024-by-1024 pixel neighborhood. A learnable gating module adaptively balances local detail and contextual cues. To encourage complementary learning, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided objective that directs the global path to prioritize regions where the local path is uncertain. We also provide calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability. To overcome the lack of high-quality annotations, we construct a marker-guided dataset from Xenium spatial transcriptomics assays, yielding single-cell resolution labels for more than two million cells across eight organs and 16 classes. Evaluated on three fully held-out cohorts, NuClass achieves up to 96 percent F1 for its best-performing class, outperforming strong baselines. Our results show that multi-scale, uncertainty-aware fusion can bridge the gap between slide-level pathological foundation models and reliable, cell-level phenotype prediction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Prompt Learning for Image- and Text-Based Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13575v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve target pedestrian images given either visual queries (image-to-image, I2I) or textual descriptions (text-to-image, T2I). Although both tasks share a common retrieval objective, they pose distinct challenges: I2I emphasizes discriminative identity learning, while T2I requires accurate cross-modal semantic alignment. Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Robust Defense Strategies for Multimodal Contrastive Learning: Efficient Fine-tuning Against Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13545v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of multimodal deep learning models, such as CLIP, has unlocked new frontiers in a wide range of applications, from image-text understanding to classification tasks. However, these models are not safe for adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, which can subtly manipulate model behavior. Moreover, existing defense methods typically involve training from scratch or fine-tuning using a large dataset without pinpointing the specific labels that are affected. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Patch-wise Tumor Classification on High-Resolution Multimodal Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13527v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patch-wise multi-label classification provides an efficient alternative to full pixel-wise segmentation on high-resolution images, particularly when the objective is to determine the presence or absence of target objects within a patch rather than their precise spatial extent. This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EurIPS 2025 Workshop: Unifying Perspectives on Learning Biases (UPLB)</p></details> | None |
| **[Beyond Patches: Mining Interpretable Part-Prototypes for Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12197v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems grow more capable, it becomes increasingly important that their decisions remain understandable and aligned with human expectations. A key challenge is the limited interpretability of deep models. Post-hoc methods like GradCAM offer heatmaps but provide limited conceptual insight, while prototype-based approaches offer example-based explanations but often rely on rigid region selection and lack semantic consistency. To address these limitations, we propose PCMNet, a part-prototypical concept mining network that learns human-comprehensible prototypes from meaningful image regions without additional supervision. By clustering these prototypes into concept groups and extracting concept activation vectors, PCMNet provides structured, concept-level explanations and enhances robustness to occlusion and challenging conditions, which are both critical for building reliable and aligned AI systems. Experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks show that PCMNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in interpretability, stability, and robustness. This work contributes to AI alignment by enhancing transparency, controllability, and trustworthiness in AI systems.

| **[Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16124v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-powered robots for enhanced human-robot interaction (HRI). To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Unlocking the Forgery Detection Potential of Vanilla MLLMs: A Novel Training-Free Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13442v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning for Interpretable Quality As- sessment of Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13353v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal image quality assessment (RIQA) supports computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases. However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper seeks to harness the capabilities of diffusion models within a visuomotor policy framework that merges visual and textual inputs to generate precise robotic trajectories. By employing reference demonstrations during training, the model learns to execute manipulation tasks specified through textual commands within the robot's immediate environment. The proposed research aims to extend an existing model by leveraging improved embeddings, and adapting techniques from diffusion models for image generation. We evaluate our methods on the CALVIN dataset, proving enhanced performance on various manipulation tasks and an increased long-horizon success rate when multiple tasks are executed in sequence. Our approach reinforces the usefulness of diffusion models and contributes towards general multitask manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages; 2 figures; 1 table.

| **[Nearest Neighbor Projection Removal Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07673v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

This work presents SF-Recon, a method that directly reconstructs lightweight building surfaces from multi-view images without post-hoc mesh simplification. We first train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) field to obtain a view-consistent representation. Building structure is then distilled by a normal-gradient-guided Gaussian optimization that selects primitives aligned with roof and wall boundaries, followed by multi-view edge-consistency pruning to enhance structural sharpness and suppress non-structural artifacts without external supervision. Finally, a multi-view depth-constrained Delaunay triangulation converts the structured Gaussian field into a lightweight, structurally faithful building mesh. Based on a proposed SF dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that our SF-Recon can directly reconstruct lightweight building models from multi-view imagery, achieving substantially fewer faces and vertices while maintaining computational efficiency.

Although many approaches adapt foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a parameter-efficient adaptation of one of the foundational pre-trained vision encoders. The proposed method, GenD, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters (0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical feature manifold using L2 normalization and metric learning on it. We conducted an extensive evaluation on 14 benchmark datasets spanning from 2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC. Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older, diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities. This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method, proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted, minimal changes to a pre-trained foundational image encoder model.

However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision, we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a diverse set of downstream tasks.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{GeoX-Bench}, a comprehensive \underline{Bench}mark designed to explore and evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in \underline{cross}-view \underline{Geo}-localization and pose estimation. Specifically, GeoX-Bench contains 10,859 panoramic-satellite image pairs spanning 128 cities in 49 countries, along with corresponding 755,976 question-answering (QA) pairs. Among these, 42,900 QA pairs are designated for benchmarking, while the remaining are intended to enhance the capabilities of LMMs. Based on GeoX-Bench, we evaluate the capabilities of 25 state-of-the-art LMMs on cross-view geo-localization and pose estimation tasks, and further explore the empowered capabilities of instruction-tuning. Our benchmark demonstrate that while current LMMs achieve impressive performance in geo-localization tasks, their effectiveness declines significantly on the more complex pose estimation tasks, highlighting a critical area for future improvement, and instruction-tuning LMMs on the training data of GeoX-Bench can significantly improve the cross-view geo-sense abilities.

Previous research has transformed reference images with salient objects into one-dimensional prompts, yielding significant results. We explore ways to enhance performance through multi-context fusion of rich salient image features and camouflaged object features. Therefore, we propose RFMNet, which utilizes features from multiple encoding stages of the reference salient images and performs interactive fusion with the camouflage features at the corresponding encoding stages. Given that the features in salient object images contain abundant object-related detail information, performing feature fusion within local areas is more beneficial for detecting camouflaged objects. Therefore, we propose an Overlapped Windows Cross-attention mechanism to enable the model to focus more attention on the local information matching based on reference features. Besides, we propose the Referring Feature Aggregation (RFA) module to decode and segment the camouflaged objects progressively. Extensive experiments on the Ref-COD benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7figures, This work is supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62203291)</p></details> | None |

We propose MRIQT, a 3D conditional diffusion framework for image quality transfer (IQT) from uLF to HF MRI. MRIQT combines realistic K-space degradation for physics-consistent uLF simulation, v-prediction with classifier-free guidance for stable image-to-image generation, and an SNR-weighted 3D perceptual loss for anatomical fidelity. The model denoises from a noised uLF input conditioned on the same scan, leveraging volumetric attention-UNet architecture for structure-preserving translation. Trained on a neonatal cohort with diverse pathologies, MRIQT surpasses recent GAN and CNN baselines in PSNR 15.3% with 1.78% over the state of the art, while physicians rated 85% of its outputs as good quality with clear pathology present. MRIQT enables high-fidelity, diffusion-based enhancement of portable ultra-low-field (uLF) MRI for deliable neonatal brain assessment.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Towards Prospective Medical Image Reconstruction via Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17644v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Clustering via Gradual Community Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02036v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep clustering is an essential task in modern artificial intelligence, aiming to partition a set of data samples into a given number of homogeneous groups (i.e., clusters). Recent studies have proposed increasingly advanced deep neural networks and training strategies for deep clustering, effectively improving performance. However, deep clustering generally remains challenging due to the inadequacy of supervision signals. Building upon the existing representation learning backbones, this paper proposes a novel clustering strategy of gradual community detection. It initializes clustering by partitioning samples into many pseudo-communities and then gradually expands clusters by community merging. Compared with the existing clustering strategies, community detection factors in the new perspective of cluster network analysis in the clustering process. The new perspective can effectively leverage global structural characteristics to enhance cluster pseudo-label purity, which is critical to the performance of self-supervision. We have implemented the proposed approach based on the popular backbones and evaluated its efficacy on benchmark image datasets. Our extensive experiments have shown that the proposed clustering strategy can effectively improve the SOTA performance. Our ablation study also demonstrates that the new network perspective can effectively improve community pseudo-label purity, resulting in improved self-supervision.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures | None |

Queries in XMC are associated with relevant labels from extremely large label spaces, where it is critical to strike a balance between efficiency and performance. Therefore, many recent approaches efficiently pose XMC as a maximum inner product search between embeddings learned from small encoder-only transformer architectures. In this paper, we address two important aspects in XMC: how to effectively harness larger decoder-only models, and how to exploit visual information while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate that both play a critical role in XMC separately and can be combined for improved performance. We show that a few billion-size decoder can deliver substantial improvements while keeping computational overhead manageable. Furthermore, our Vision-enhanced eXtreme Multi-label Learning framework (ViXML) efficiently integrates foundation vision models by pooling a single embedding per image. This limits computational growth while unlocking multi-modal capabilities. Remarkably, ViXML with small encoders outperforms text-only decoder in most cases, showing that an image is worth billions of parameters. Finally, we present an extension of existing text-only datasets to exploit visual metadata and make them available for future benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments across four public text-only datasets and their corresponding image enhanced versions validate our proposals' effectiveness, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by up to +8.21\% in P@1 on the largest dataset.

Preference optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes through CFG. However, prior NPO approaches rely on costly and fragile procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose Self-NPO, specifically truncated diffusion fine-tuning, a data-free approach of negative preference optimization by directly learning from the model itself, eliminating the need for manual data labeling or reward model training. This data-free approach is highly efficient (less than 1% training cost of Diffusion-NPO) and achieves comparable performance to Diffusion-NPO in a data-free manner. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences, consistently enhancing both their generation quality and alignment with human preferences.

Although deep learning has achieved great success in many cross-modal tasks, its performance on SAR-Optical registration tasks is still unsatisfactory. Gradient-based information has traditionally played a crucial role in handcrafted descriptors by highlighting structural differences. However, such gradient cues have not been effectively leveraged in deep learning frameworks for SAR-Optical image matching. To address this gap, we propose SOMA, a dense registration framework that integrates structural gradient priors into deep features and refines alignment through a hybrid matching strategy. Specifically, we introduce the Feature Gradient Enhancer (FGE), which embeds multi-scale, multi-directional gradient filters into the feature space using attention and reconstruction mechanisms to boost feature distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose the Global-Local Affine-Flow Matcher (GLAM), which combines affine transformation and flow-based refinement within a coarse-to-fine architecture to ensure both structural consistency and local accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SOMA significantly improves registration precision, increasing the CMR@1px by 12.29% on the SEN1-2 dataset and 18.50% on the GFGE_SO dataset. In addition, SOMA exhibits strong robustness and generalizes well across diverse scenes and resolutions.</p></details> |  | None |

A key challenge is to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$ circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025. 10 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Virtual Multiplex Staining for Histological Images using a Marker-wise Conditioned Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14681v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling complex data distributions by utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers. To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches. This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&E image repositories.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 accepted | None |

In telecommunications, they hold the potential to transform network optimization, automate troubleshooting, enhance customer support, and ensure regulatory compliance. However, their deployment in telecom is hindered by domain-specific challenges that demand specialized adaptation. To overcome these challenges and to accelerate the adaptation of LLMs for telecom, we propose MM-Telco, a comprehensive suite of multimodal benchmarks and models tailored for the telecom domain. The benchmark introduces various tasks (both text based and image based) that address various practical real-life use cases such as network operations, network management, improving documentation quality, and retrieval of relevant text and images. Further, we perform baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. The models fine-tuned on our dataset exhibit a significant boost in performance. Our experiments also help analyze the weak areas in the working of current state-of-art multimodal LLMs, thus guiding towards further development and research.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong temporal reasoning capabilities, making them a promising tool for enhancing reconstruction quality under sparse-view settings. However, existing approaches are primarily designed for modest viewpoint variations, which struggle in capturing fine-grained details in close-up scenarios since input information is severely limited. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based framework, called CloseUpShot, for close-up novel view synthesis from sparse inputs via point-conditioned video diffusion. Specifically, we observe that pixel-warping conditioning suffers from severe sparsity and background leakage in close-up settings. To address this, we propose hierarchical warping and occlusion-aware noise suppression, enhancing the quality and completeness of the conditioning images for the video diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce global structure guidance, which leverages a dense fused point cloud to provide consistent geometric context to the diffusion process, to compensate for the lack of globally consistent 3D constraints in sparse conditioning inputs. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, especially in close-up novel view synthesis, clearly validating the effectiveness of our design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Link: https://zyqz97.github.io/CloseUpShot/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zyqz97.github.io/CloseUpShot) |

While existing deraining methods have made considerable progress, they often struggle with fidelity of semantic and spatial details. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Prior Hierarchical Mamba (MPHM) network for image deraining. This novel architecture synergistically integrates macro-semantic textual priors (CLIP) for task-level semantic guidance and micro-structural visual priors (DINOv2) for scene-aware structural information. To alleviate potential conflicts between heterogeneous priors, we devise a progressive Priors Fusion Injection (PFI) that strategically injects complementary cues at different decoder levels. Meanwhile, we equip the backbone network with an elaborate Hierarchical Mamba Module (HMM) to facilitate robust feature representation, featuring a Fourier-enhanced dual-path design that concurrently addresses global context modeling and local detail recovery. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MPHM's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 0.57 dB PSNR gain on the Rain200H dataset while delivering superior generalization on real-world rainy scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Implicit Neural Degradation Representation for Unpaired Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13110v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing is an important task in the field of computer vision, aiming at restoring clear and detail-rich visual content from haze-affected images. However, when dealing with complex scenes, existing methods often struggle to strike a balance between fine-grained feature representation of inhomogeneous haze distribution and global consistency modeling. Furthermore, to better learn the common degenerate representation of haze in spatial variations, we propose an unsupervised dehaze method for implicit neural degradation representation. Firstly, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a mechanism combining the channel-independent and channel-dependent mechanisms, which efficiently enhances the ability to learn from nonlinear dependencies. which in turn achieves good visual perception in complex scenes. Moreover, we design an implicit neural representation to model haze degradation as a continuous function to eliminate redundant information and the dependence on explicit feature extraction and physical models. To further learn the implicit representation of the haze features, we also designed a dense residual enhancement module from it to eliminate redundant information. This achieves high-quality image restoration. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive dehaze performance on various public and real-world datasets.

| **[Low-Level Dataset Distillation for Medical Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13106v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image enhancement is clinically valuable, but existing methods require large-scale datasets to learn complex pixel-level mappings. However, the substantial training and storage costs associated with these datasets hinder their practical deployment. While dataset distillation (DD) can alleviate these burdens, existing methods mainly target high-level tasks, where multiple samples share the same label. This many-to-one mapping allows distilled data to capture shared semantics and achieve information compression. In contrast, low-level tasks involve a many-to-many mapping that requires pixel-level fidelity, making low-level DD an underdetermined problem, as a small distilled dataset cannot fully constrain the dense pixel-level mappings. To address this, we propose the first low-level DD method for medical image enhancement. We first leverage anatomical similarities across patients to construct the shared anatomical prior based on a representative patient, which serves as the initialization for the distilled data of different patients. This prior is then personalized for each patient using a Structure-Preserving Personalized Generation (SPG) module, which integrates patient-specific anatomical information into the distilled dataset while preserving pixel-level fidelity. For different low-level tasks, the distilled data is used to construct task-specific high- and low-quality training pairs. Patient-specific knowledge is injected into the distilled data by aligning the gradients computed from networks trained on the distilled pairs with those from the corresponding patient's raw data. Notably, downstream users cannot access raw patient data. Instead, only a distilled dataset containing abstract training information is shared, which excludes patient-specific details and thus preserves privacy.</p></details> |  | None |

While this paradigm enhances robustness and flexibility by disentangling the dependency of support images, our critical analysis reveals two inherent limitations of static joint embedding: (1) polysemy-induced cross-category ambiguity during the matching process(e.g., the concept "leg" exhibiting divergent visual manifestations across humans and furniture), and (2) insufficient discriminability for fine-grained intra-category variations (e.g., posture and fur discrepancies between a sleeping white cat and a standing black cat). To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework that innovatively integrates hierarchical cross-modal interaction with dual-stream feature refinement, enhancing the joint embedding with both class-level and instance-specific cues from textual description and specific images. Experiments on the MP-100 dataset demonstrate that, regardless of the network backbone, CapeNext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CAPE methods by a large margin.</p></details> |  | None |

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a powerful vision foundation model originally designed for natural image segmentation, has shown remarkable potential when adapted to medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing SAM adaptation methods follow a single-expert paradigm, developing models based on individual expert annotations to predict deterministic masks. These methods systematically ignore the inherent uncertainty and variability in expert annotations, which fundamentally contradicts clinical practice, where multiple specialists provide different yet equally valid interpretations that collectively enhance diagnostic confidence. We propose an Uncertainty-aware Adapter, the first SAM adaptation framework designed to transition from single expert mindset to collective intelligence representation. Our approach integrates stochastic uncertainty sampling from a Conditional Variational Autoencoder into the adapters, enabling diverse prediction generation that captures expert knowledge distributions rather than individual expert annotations. We employ a novel position-conditioned control mechanism to integrate multi-expert knowledge, ensuring that the output distribution closely aligns with the multi-annotation distribution. Comprehensive evaluations across seven medical segmentation benchmarks have demonstrated that our collective intelligence-based adaptation achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new adaptation framework for reliable clinical implementation.</p></details> |  | None |

While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, acquiring HSI data remains costly and technically demanding. Hyperspectral image reconstruction offers a practical solution by recovering HSI data from accessible modalities, such as RGB. While general domain datasets are abundant, the scarcity of human HSI data limits progress in medical applications. To tackle this, we propose SpectralAdapt, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that bridges the domain gap between general and human-centered HSI datasets. To fully exploit limited labels and abundant unlabeled data, we enhance spectral reasoning by introducing Spectral Density Masking (SDM), which adaptively masks RGB channels based on their spectral complexity, encouraging recovery of informative regions from complementary cues during consistency training. Furthermore, we introduce Spectral Endmember Representation Alignment (SERA), which derives physically interpretable endmembers from valuable labeled pixels and employs them as domain-invariant anchors to guide unlabeled predictions, with momentum updates ensuring adaptability and stability. These components are seamlessly integrated into SpectralAdapt, a spectral prior-guided framework that effectively mitigates domain shift, spectral degradation, and data scarcity in HSI reconstruction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity, cross-domain generalization, and training stability, highlighting the promise of SSDA as an efficient solution for hyperspectral imaging in healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose the Quadtree Diffusion Model (QDM), a region-adaptive diffusion framework that leverages a quadtree structure to selectively enhance detail-rich regions while reducing computations in homogeneous areas. By guiding the diffusion with a quadtree derived from the low-quality input, QDM identifies key regions-represented by leaf nodes-where fine detail is essential and applies minimal refinement elsewhere. This mask-guided, two-stream architecture adaptively balances quality and efficiency, producing high-fidelity outputs with low computational redundancy. Experiments demonstrate QDM's effectiveness in high-resolution SR tasks across diverse image types, particularly in medical imaging (e.g., CT scans), where large homogeneous regions are prevalent.

Such cross-modal couplings can produce unsafe semantics even when individual inputs are benign, exposing the fragile safety awareness of current MLLMs. While recent works enhance safety by guiding models to reason about potential risks, unregulated reasoning traces may compromise alignment; although Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers self-rewarded refinement without human supervision, it lacks verifiable signals for reasoning safety. To address this, we propose SafeGRPO a self-rewarded multimodal safety alignment framework that integrates rule-governed reward construction into GRPO, enabling interpretable and verifiable optimization of reasoning safety. Built upon the constructed SafeTag-VL-3K dataset with explicit visual, textual, and combined safety tags, SafeGRPO performs step-guided safety thinking to enforce structured reasoning and behavior alignment, substantially improving multimodal safety awareness, compositional robustness, and reasoning stability across diverse benchmarks without sacrificing general capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image.

While computational methods predict gene expression from H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs), existing approaches often fail to capture the intricate biological heterogeneity within spots and are susceptible to morphological noise when integrating contextual information from surrounding tissue. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiFusion, a novel deep learning framework that integrates two complementary components. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Intra-Spot Modeling module that extracts fine-grained morphological representations through multi-resolution sub-patch decomposition, guided by a feature alignment loss to ensure semantic consistency across scales. Concurrently, we present the Context-aware Cross-scale Fusion module, which employs cross-attention to selectively incorporate biologically relevant regional context, thereby enhancing representational capacity. This architecture enables comprehensive modeling of both cellular-level features and tissue microenvironmental cues, which are essential for accurate gene expression prediction. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ST datasets demonstrate that HiFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across both 2D slide-wise cross-validation and more challenging 3D sample-specific scenarios. These results underscore HiFusion's potential as a robust, accurate, and scalable solution for ST inference from routine histopathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026. 7 pages (main text), 12 pages total including references and supplementary material. 6 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Fast Kernel-Space Diffusion for Remote Sensing Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18991v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pansharpening seeks to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) and low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images into a single image with both fine spatial and rich spectral detail. Despite progress in deep learning-based approaches, existing methods often fail to capture global priors inherent in remote sensing data distributions. Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as promising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities, however, they suffer from heavy inference latency. We introduce KSDiff, a fast kernel-space diffusion framework that generates convolutional kernels enriched with global context to enhance pansharpening quality and accelerate inference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the integration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator, orchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, facilitating integration into existing pansharpening architectures. Experiments show that KSDiff achieves superior performance compared to recent promising methods, and with over $500 \times$ faster inference than diffusion-based pansharpening baselines. Ablation studies, visualizations and further evaluations substantiate the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be released upon possible acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ProtoAnomalyNCD: Prototype Learning for Multi-class Novel Anomaly Discovery in Industrial Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12938v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing industrial anomaly detection methods mainly determine whether an anomaly is present. However, real-world applications also require discovering and classifying multiple anomaly types. Since industrial anomalies are semantically subtle and current methods do not sufficiently exploit image priors, direct clustering approaches often perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose ProtoAnomalyNCD, a prototype-learning-based framework for discovering unseen anomaly classes of multiple types that can be integrated with various anomaly detection methods. First, to suppress background clutter, we leverage Grounded SAM with text prompts to localize object regions as priors for the anomaly classification network. Next, because anomalies usually appear as subtle and fine-grained patterns on the product, we introduce an Anomaly-Map-Guided Attention block. Within this block, we design a Region Guidance Factor that helps the attention module distinguish among background, object regions, and anomalous regions. By using both localized product regions and anomaly maps as priors, the module enhances anomalous features while suppressing background noise and preserving normal features for contrastive learning. Finally, under a unified prototype-learning framework, ProtoAnomalyNCD discovers and clusters unseen anomaly classes while simultaneously enabling multi-type anomaly classification. We further extend our method to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the MVTec AD, MTD, and Real-IAD datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures | None |

However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the existing fine-tuning methods often ignore cross-modal heterogeneity, limiting their full potential. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy by injecting beneficial random noise, which outperforms previous methods and even surpasses full fine-tuning, with minimal additional parameters. The proposed Multimodal Noise Generator (MuNG) enables efficient modality fine-tuning by injecting customized noise into the frozen MLLMs. Specifically, we reformulate the reasoning process of MLLMs from a variational inference perspective, upon which we design a multimodal noise generator that dynamically analyzes cross-modal relationships in image-text pairs to generate task-adaptive beneficial noise. Injecting this type of noise into the MLLMs effectively suppresses irrelevant semantic components, leading to significantly improved cross-modal representation alignment and enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two mainstream MLLMs, QwenVL and LLaVA, demonstrate that our method surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning and other existing fine-tuning approaches, while requiring adjustments to only about $1\sim2\%$ additional parameters.

| **[ActVAR: Activating Mixtures of Weights and Tokens for Efficient Visual Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12893v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models enable efficient image generation via next-scale prediction but face escalating computational costs as sequence length grows. Existing static pruning methods degrade performance by permanently removing weights or tokens, disrupting pretrained dependencies. To address this, we propose ActVAR, a dynamic activation framework that introduces dual sparsity across model weights and token sequences to enhance efficiency without sacrificing capacity. ActVAR decomposes feedforward networks (FFNs) into lightweight expert sub-networks and employs a learnable router to dynamically select token-specific expert subsets based on content. Simultaneously, a gated token selector identifies high-update-potential tokens for computation while reconstructing unselected tokens to preserve global context and sequence alignment. Training employs a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, where the original VAR model supervises the learning of routing and gating policies to align with pretrained knowledge. Experiments on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark demonstrate that ActVAR achieves up to $21.2\%$ FLOPs reduction with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Physics-Aware Semi-Supervised Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11470v6)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images normally suffer from degradation due to the transmission medium of water bodies. Both traditional prior-based approaches and deep learning-based methods have been used to address this problem. However, the inflexible assumption of the former often impairs their effectiveness in handling diverse underwater scenes, while the generalization of the latter to unseen images is usually weakened by insufficient data. In this study, we leverage both the physics-based underwater Image Formation Model (IFM) and deep learning techniques for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE). To this end, we propose a novel Physics-Aware Dual-Stream Underwater Image Enhancement Network, i.e., PA-UIENet, which comprises a Transmission Estimation Steam (T-Stream) and an Ambient Light Estimation Stream (A-Stream). This network fulfills the UIE task by explicitly estimating the degradation parameters of the IFM. We also adopt an IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework, which exploits both the labeled and unlabeled images, to address the issue of insufficient data. Our method performs better than, or at least comparably to, eight baselines across five testing sets in the degradation estimation and UIE tasks. This should be due to the fact that it not only can model the degradation but also can learn the characteristics of diverse underwater scenes.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |

Recently, SR methods have been developed that not only increase resolution while preserving the original image information but also enhance the perceived quality. However, evaluating the quality of SR images generated from low-quality sources, such as SR-enhanced broadcast content, is challenging due to the need to consider both distortions and improvements. Additionally, assessing SR image quality without original high-quality sources presents another significant challenge. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of research specifically addressing the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of SR images under these conditions. In this work, we introduce a new IQA dataset for SR broadcast images in both 2K and 4K resolutions. We conducted a subjective quality evaluation to obtain Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for these SR images and performed a comprehensive human study to identify key factors influencing perceived quality. Finally, we evaluated the performance of existing IQA metrics on our dataset. This study reveals the limitations of current metrics, highlighting the need for a more robust IQA metric that better correlates with the perceived quality of SR images. The proposed dataset and the subjective evaluation platform are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/hanyang.ac.kr/ivml/datasets/sreb.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 258% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Appreciate the View: A Task-Aware Evaluation Framework for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12675v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is to generate realistic images of a given content from unseen viewpoints. But how can we trust that a generated image truly reflects the intended transformation? Evaluating its reliability remains a major challenge. While recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based approaches, have significantly improved NVS quality, existing evaluation metrics struggle to assess whether a generated image is both realistic and faithful to the source view and intended viewpoint transformation. Standard metrics, such as pixel-wise similarity and distribution-based measures, often mis-rank incorrect results as they fail to capture the nuanced relationship between the source image, viewpoint change, and generated output. We propose a task-aware evaluation framework that leverages features from a strong NVS foundation model, Zero123, combined with a lightweight tuning step to enhance discrimination. Using these features, we introduce two complementary evaluation metrics: a reference-based score, $D_{\text{PRISM}}$, and a reference-free score, $\text{MMD}_{\text{PRISM}}$. Both reliably identify incorrect generations and rank models in agreement with human preference studies, addressing a fundamental gap in NVS evaluation. Our framework provides a principled and practical approach to assessing synthesis quality, paving the way for more reliable progress in novel view synthesis. To further support this goal, we apply our reference-free metric to six NVS methods across three benchmarks: Toys4K, Google Scanned Objects (GSO), and OmniObject3D, where $\text{MMD}_{\text{PRISM}}$ produces a clear and stable ranking, with lower scores consistently indicating stronger models.</p></details> | <details><summary>3DV 2...</summary><p>3DV 2026.

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on complex auxiliary inputs such as body parsing and warped mask or require finely designed extract branches to process various input conditions, RefTON streamlines the process by directly generating try-on results from a source image and a target garment, without the need for structural guidance or auxiliary components to handle diverse inputs. Moreover, inspired by human clothing selection behavior, RefTON leverages additional reference images (the target garment worn on different individuals) to provide powerful guidance for refining texture alignment and maintaining the garment details. To enable this capability, we built a dataset containing unpaired reference images for training. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that RefTON achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a simple and efficient person-to-person design.</p></details> |  | None |

However, fine-tuning these models is resource-intensive due to their large number of parameters. Prompt tuning has emerged as a viable solution to mitigate memory usage and reduce training time while maintaining competitive performance. Nevertheless, the challenge is that existing prompt tuning methods cannot precisely distinguish different kinds of medical concepts, which miss essentially specific disease-related features across various medical imaging modalities in medical image classification tasks. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora, are particularly adept at providing this specialized medical knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose incorporating LLMs into the prompt tuning process. Specifically, we introduce the CILMP, Conditional Intervention of Large Language Models for Prompt Tuning, a method that bridges LLMs and VLMs to facilitate the transfer of medical knowledge into VLM prompts. CILMP extracts disease-specific representations from LLMs, intervenes within a low-rank linear subspace, and utilizes them to create disease-specific prompts. Additionally, a conditional mechanism is incorporated to condition the intervention process on each individual medical image, generating instance-adaptive prompts and thus enhancing adaptability. Extensive experiments across diverse medical image datasets demonstrate that CILMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Yet, due to hardware limitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images often suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have witnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing works usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics of fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover comprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the target of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical image-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale target-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE) that employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural information and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving hierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real fundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local structural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA) module is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts. Experimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement performance with a more lightweight architecture. Furthermore, our approach generalizes to other ophthalmic image processing tasks without supervised fine-tuning, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Neural Networks (Elsevier), 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP), which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its overall effectiveness.

This task challenges both traditional segmentation methods and modern foundation models, which fail dramatically on camouflaged objects. We identify six fundamental challenges in COD: Intrinsic Similarity, Edge Disruption, Extreme Scale Variation, Environmental Complexities, Contextual Dependencies, and Salient-Camouflaged Object Disambiguation. These challenges frequently co-occur and compound the difficulty of detection, requiring comprehensive architectural solutions. We propose C3Net, which addresses all challenges through a specialized dual-pathway decoder architecture. The Edge Refinement Pathway employs gradient-initialized Edge Enhancement Modules to recover precise boundaries from early features. The Contextual Localization Pathway utilizes our novel Image-based Context Guidance mechanism to achieve intrinsic saliency suppression without external models. An Attentive Fusion Module synergistically combines the two pathways via spatial gating.

While existing progression prediction techniques demonstrate potential with multimodal data, they are highly limited by their reliance on labelled data and fail to account for a key element of future progression prediction: not all features extracted at the current moment may be relevant for predicting progression several years later. To address these limitations in the literature, we design a novel semi-supervised multimodal learning hypergraph architecture, termed HIBMatch, by harnessing hypergraph knowledge based on information bottleneck and consistency regularisation strategies. Firstly, our framework utilises hypergraphs to represent multimodal data, encompassing both imaging and non-imaging modalities. Secondly, to harmonise relevant information from the currently captured data for future MCI conversion prediction, we propose a Hypergraph Information Bottleneck (HIB) that discriminates against irrelevant information, thereby focusing exclusively on harmonising relevant information for future MCI conversion prediction. Thirdly, our method enforces consistency regularisation between the HIB and a discriminative classifier to enhance the robustness and generalisation capabilities of HIBMatch under both topological and feature perturbations. Finally, to fully exploit the unlabeled data, HIBMatch incorporates a cross-modal contrastive loss for data efficiency. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed HIBMatch framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in Alzheimer's disease prognosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (To appear)</p></details> | None |

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the Qwen2.5-7B dense architecture, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%).

This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566 participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns (Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78) outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79). Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures | None |

To improve efficiency, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning, reducing computational costs while maintaining high detection accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on a morphing dataset built from three publicly available face datasets, incorporating ten different morphing generation algorithms to assess robustness. The proposed method is benchmarked against six state-of-the-art S-MAD techniques, demonstrating superior detection performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, we propose MR-COSMO, a Visual-Text Memory Recall and Direct CrOSs-MOdal Alignment Method for Query-Driven 3D Segmentation, establishing explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and text/2D image data through a dedicated direct cross-modal alignment module while implementing a visual-text memory module with specialized feature banks. This direct alignment mechanism enables precise fusion of geometric and semantic features, while the memory module employs specialized banks storing text features, visual features, and their correspondence mappings to dynamically enhance scene-specific representations via attention-based knowledge recall. Comprehensive experiments across 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation benchmarks confirm state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

However, existing methods fail to effectively exploit shallow structural information and struggle to capture fine-grained semantic differences through contrastive samples generated by image augmentations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal recognition of both structural and discriminative details in ultrasound standard planes. To address these issues, we propose SEMC, a novel Structure-Enhanced Mixture-of-Experts Contrastive learning framework that combines structure-aware feature fusion with expert-guided contrastive learning. Specifically, we first introduce a novel Semantic-Structure Fusion Module (SSFM) to exploit multi-scale structural information and enhance the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structural details by effectively aligning shallow and deep features. Then, a novel Mixture-of-Experts Contrastive Recognition Module (MCRM) is designed to perform hierarchical contrastive learning and classification across multi-level features using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism, further improving class separability and recognition performance. More importantly, we also curate a large-scale and meticulously annotated liver ultrasound dataset containing six standard planes. Extensive experimental results on our in-house dataset and two public datasets demonstrate that SEMC outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Existing methods suffer from inadequate generalization capabilities, resulting in unsatisfactory performance on emerging generative models. To address this issue, this paper presents NIRNet (Noise-based Imprint Revealing Network), a novel framework that leverages noise-based imprint for the detection task. Specifically, we propose a novel Noise-based Imprint Simulator to capture intrinsic patterns imprinted in images generated by different models. By aggregating imprint from various generative models, imprint of future models can be extrapolated to expand training data, thereby enhancing generalization and robustness. Furthermore, we design a new pipeline that pioneers the use of noise patterns, derived from a Noise-based Imprint Extractor, alongside other visual features for AI-generated image detection, significantly improving detection performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven diverse benchmarks, including five public datasets and two newly proposed generalization tests, demonstrating its superior generalization and effectiveness.

We observe that pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit inter-layer redundancy akin to that in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, dense convolutional layers can be efficiently replaced by derived "child" layers generated from a shared "parent" convolutional kernel through an adapter. To address these limitations and implement the weight-sharing mechanism, we propose a lightweight convolution kernel plug-in, named KernelDNA. It decouples kernel adaptation into input-dependent dynamic routing and pre-trained static modulation, ensuring both parameter efficiency and hardware-friendly inference. Unlike existing dynamic convolutions that expand parameters via multi-kernel ensembles, our method leverages cross-layer weight sharing and adapter-based modulation, enabling dynamic kernel specialization without altering the standard convolution structure. This design preserves the native computational efficiency of standard convolutions while enhancing representation power through input-adaptive kernel adjustments. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction tasks demonstrate that KernelDNA achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency balance among dynamic convolution variants.</p></details> |  | None |

This enables improved detection accuracy and more efficient hardware designs by bypassing the ISP. However, RAW object detection is challenging due to limited training data, unbalanced pixel distributions, and sensor noise. To address this, we propose SimROD, a lightweight and effective approach for RAW object detection. We introduce a Global Gamma Enhancement (GGE) module, which applies a learnable global gamma transformation with only four parameters, improving feature representation while keeping the model efficient. Additionally, we leverage the green channel's richer signal to enhance local details, aligning with the human eye's sensitivity and Bayer filter design. Extensive experiments on multiple RAW object detection datasets and detectors demonstrate that SimROD outperforms state-of-the-art methods like RAW-Adapter and DIAP while maintaining efficiency. Our work highlights the potential of RAW data for real-world object detection.

Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings, (2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging. MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further development within the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

In this study, we present a deep learning-based system capable of identifying both brain tumors and strokes from MRI images, along with their respective stages. We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation. The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\% and validation accuracy up to 88\%. While ResNet-50 demonstrated slightly better results, Mobile Net V2 remains a promising option for real-time diagnosis in low resource settings due to its lightweight architecture. This research offers a practical AI-driven solution for early brain abnormality detection, with potential for clinical deployment and future enhancement through larger datasets and multi modal inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint version of the manuscript.

| **[RoboAfford++: A Generative AI-Enhanced Dataset for Multimodal Affordance Learning in Robotic Manipulation and Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12436v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation and navigation are fundamental capabilities of embodied intelligence, enabling effective robot interactions with the physical world. Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text-Guided Channel Perturbation and Pretrained Knowledge Integration for Unified Multi-Modality Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12432v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modality image fusion enhances scene perception by combining complementary information. Unified models aim to share parameters across modalities for multi-modality image fusion, but large modality differences often cause gradient conflicts, limiting performance. Some methods introduce modality-specific encoders to enhance feature perception and improve fusion quality. However, this strategy reduces generalisation across different fusion tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified multi-modality image fusion framework based on channel perturbation and pre-trained knowledge integration (UP-Fusion). To suppress redundant modal information and emphasize key features, we propose the Semantic-Aware Channel Pruning Module (SCPM), which leverages the semantic perception capability of a pre-trained model to filter and enhance multi-modality feature channels. Furthermore, we proposed the Geometric Affine Modulation Module (GAM), which uses original modal features to apply affine transformations on initial fusion features to maintain the feature encoder modal discriminability. Finally, we apply a Text-Guided Channel Perturbation Module (TCPM) during decoding to reshape the channel distribution, reducing the dependence on modality-specific channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods on both multi-modality image fusion and downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Conditional Panoramic Image Generation via Masked Autoregressive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16862v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in panoramic image generation has underscored two critical limitations in existing approaches. First, most methods are built upon diffusion models, which are inherently ill-suited for equirectangular projection (ERP) panoramas due to the violation of the identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise assumption caused by their spherical mapping. Second, these methods often treat text-conditioned generation (text-to-panorama) and image-conditioned generation (panorama outpainting) as separate tasks, relying on distinct architectures and task-specific data. In this work, we propose a unified framework, Panoramic AutoRegressive model (PAR), which leverages masked autoregressive modeling to address these challenges. PAR avoids the i.i.d. assumption constraint and integrates text and image conditioning into a cohesive architecture, enabling seamless generation across tasks. To address the inherent discontinuity in existing generative models, we introduce circular padding to enhance spatial coherence and propose a consistency alignment strategy to improve generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in text-to-image generation and panorama outpainting tasks while showcasing promising scalability and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

However, real-world images are often degraded by adverse weather, and weather restoration methods may sacrifice high-frequency details critical for analyzing small objects. A natural solution is to apply super-resolution (SR) after weather removal to recover both clarity and fine structures. However, simply cascading restoration and SR struggle to bridge their inherent conflict: removal aims to remove high-frequency weather-induced noise, while SR aims to hallucinate high-frequency textures from existing details, leading to inconsistent restoration contents. In this paper, we take deraining as a case study and propose DHGM, a Diffusion-based High-frequency Guided Model for generating clean and high-resolution images. DHGM integrates pre-trained diffusion priors with high-pass filters to simultaneously remove rain artifacts and enhance structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHGM achieves superior performance over existing methods, with lower costs.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring through multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Our method integrates both time and frequency domains by first passing the raw EEG signals through the convolutional encoder to obtain the time domain representations. Next, we measure the Power Spectral Density (PSD) for all five EEG frequency bands and generate the channel power values as 2D images referred to as multi-spectral topography maps. These multi-spectral topography maps are then fed to a separate encoder to obtain the representations in frequency domain. Our solution employs a multi-domain attention module that maps these domain-specific embeddings onto a shared embedding space to emphasize more on important inter-domain relationships to enhance the representations for cognitive load classification. Additionally, we incorporate an orthogonal projection constraint during the training of our method to effectively increase the inter-class distances while improving intra-class clustering. This enhancement allows efficient discrimination between different cognitive states and aids in better grouping of similar states within the feature space. We validate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on two public EEG datasets, CL-Drive and CLARE for cognitive load classification. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our multi-domain approach over the traditional single-domain techniques. Moreover, we conduct ablation and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of various components of our method. Finally, robustness experiments on different amounts of added noise demonstrate the stability of our method compared to other state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Transactions on Human Machine Systems for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, they often struggle to generalise beyond the training distribution due to decision boundaries that lack a clear definition of normality. Existing approaches typically address this by regularising the representation space during training, leading to separate optimisation in latent and label spaces. The learned normality is therefore not directly utilised at inference, and their anomaly scores often fall within arbitrary ranges that require explicit mapping or calibration for probabilistic interpretation. To achieve unified learning of geometric normality and label discrimination, we propose Centre-Enhanced Discriminative Learning (CEDL), a novel supervised anomaly detection framework that embeds geometric normality directly into the discriminative objective. CEDL reparameterises the conventional sigmoid-derived prediction logit through a centre-based radial distance function, unifying geometric and discriminative learning in a single end-to-end formulation. This design enables interpretable, geometry-aware anomaly scoring without post-hoc thresholding or reference calibration. Extensive experiments on tabular, time-series, and image data demonstrate that CEDL achieves competitive and balanced performance across diverse real-world anomaly detection tasks, validating its effectiveness and broad applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

This study leverages a hybrid quantum-classical framework in this regard. We combine a pretrained ResNet50 encoder, with a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) to explore quantum-assisted diagnosis. We pre-process the kidney images using denoising and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to enhance feature extraction. We address class imbalance through data augmentation and weighted sampling. Latent features extracted by the encoder are transformed into qubits via angle encoding and processed by a QCNN. The model is evaluated on both 8-qubit and 12-qubit configurations. Both architectures achieved rapid convergence with stable learning curves and high consistency between training and validation performance. The models reached a test accuracy of 0.99, with the 12-qubit configuration providing improvements in overall recall and precision, particularly for Cyst and Tumor detection, where it achieved perfect recall for Cysts and a tumor F1-score of 0.9956. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed reliable classification behavior across all classes, with very few misclassifications. Results demonstrate that integrating classical pre-processing and deep feature extraction with quantum circuits enhances medical diagnostic performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the usefulness of existing attention-based models in capturing complex visual patterns for medical image classification, underlying architectures often face challenges in effectively distinguishing subtle classes since they struggle to capture inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, resulting in incorrect diagnosis. To address this, we propose AGGRNet framework to extract informative and non-informative features to effectively understand fine-grained visual patterns and improve classification for complex medical image analysis tasks. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various medical imaging datasets, with the best improvement up to 5% over SOTA models on the Kvasir dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, single-task models are predominantly used, overlooking the shared information across tasks. This oversight leads to inefficiencies in real-life applications. In this work, we propose MTMed3D, a novel end-to-end Multi-task Transformer-based model to address the limitations of single-task models by jointly performing 3D detection, segmentation, and classification in medical imaging. Our model uses a Transformer as the shared encoder to generate multi-scale features, followed by CNN-based task-specific decoders. The proposed framework was evaluated on the BraTS 2018 and 2019 datasets, achieving promising results across all three tasks, especially in detection, where our method achieves better results than prior works. Additionally, we compare our multi-task model with equivalent single-task variants trained separately. Our multi-task model significantly reduces computational costs and achieves faster inference speed while maintaining comparable performance to the single-task models, highlighting its efficiency advantage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage Transformers for multi-task learning that simultaneously covers detection, segmentation, and classification tasks in 3D medical imaging, presenting its potential to enhance diagnostic processes.

While CNNs excel at local feature extraction and transformers capture long-range dependencies, their isolated application yields suboptimal results due to quadratic complexity and insufficient inductive biases. We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck. The model employs a multi-scale convolutional stem with deep residual blocks and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module for hierarchical spatial features, followed by spectral encoder layers combining bidirectional RNNs (LSTM/GRU) with Multi-Scale Spectral Latent Attention (MSLA). MSLA reduces complexity from $\mathcal{O}(T^2D)$ to $\mathcal{O}(T\log(T)D)$ by adaptive latent token allocation (8-64 tokens) that scales logarithmically with the sequence length. Hierarchical cross-attention fusion dynamically aggregates multi-level representations for robust classification. Experiments conducted on the Indian Pines and Salinas datasets show state-of-the-art performance, achieving overall accuracies of 99.71% and 99.96%, significantly surpassing HybridSN, SSRN, and SpectralFormer. The learned embeddings exhibit superior inter-class separability and compact intra-class clustering, validating CLAReSNet's effectiveness under limited samples and severe class imbalance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Time in Static Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12321v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)</p></details> | None |

However, most existing efforts remain limited to single-modality inputs and channel-specific objec- tives, overlooking the broader potential of large foundation models for unified wireless sensing. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSense, a multi-modal, multi-task foundation model that jointly addresses channel-centric, environment-aware, and human-centered sensing. Our framework integrates image, radar, LiDAR, and textual data by transforming them into vision- compatible representations, enabling effective cross-modal align- ment within a unified feature space. A modality gating mecha- nism adaptively fuses these representations, while a vision-based large language model backbone enables unified feature align- ment and instruction-driven task adaptation. Furthermore, task- specific sequential attention and uncertainty-based loss weighting mechanisms enhance cross-task generalization. Experiments on real wireless scenario datasets show that our approach outper- forms both task-specific and large-model baselines, confirming its strong generalization across heterogeneous sensing tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rethinking Bias in Generative Data Augmentation for Medical AI: a Frequency Recalibration Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12301v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing Medical AI relies on large datasets and easily suffers from data scarcity. Generative data augmentation (GDA) using AI generative models offers a solution to synthesize realistic medical images. However, the bias in GDA is often underestimated in medical domains, with concerns about the risk of introducing detrimental features generated by AI and harming downstream tasks. This paper identifies the frequency misalignment between real and synthesized images as one of the key factors underlying unreliable GDA and proposes the Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method to reduce the frequency distributional discrepancy and thus improve GDA. FreRec involves (1) Statistical High-frequency Replacement (SHR) to roughly align high-frequency components and (2) Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) to enhance image quality and reconstruct high-frequency details. Extensive experiments were conducted in various medical datasets, including brain MRIs, chest X-rays, and fundus images. The results show that FreRec significantly improves downstream medical image classification performance compared to uncalibrated AI-synthesized samples. FreRec is a standalone post-processing step that is compatible with any generative model and can integrate seamlessly with common medical GDA pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for AAAI 2026 (Main Track Poster)</p></details> | None |
| **[Realism Control One-step Diffusion for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10122v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions. While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency. Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary materials is included.

While diffusion models have advanced MDE with impressive generalization, they often exhibit limitations in accurately reconstructing far-range regions. This difficulty arises from two key challenges. First, the implicit multi-scale processing in standard spatial-domain models can be insufficient for preserving the fine-grained, high-frequency details crucial for distant structures. Second, the intrinsic long-tail distribution of depth data imposes a strong training bias towards more prevalent near-range regions. To address these, we propose VistaDepth, a novel diffusion framework designed for balanced and accurate depth perception. We introduce two key innovations. First, the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module enhances the model's ability to represent high-frequency details. It operates by having a lightweight network predict a dynamic, content-aware spectral filter to refine latent features, thereby improving the reconstruction of distant structures. Second, our BiasMap mechanism introduces an adaptive reweighting of the diffusion loss strategically scaled across diffusion timesteps. It further aligns the supervision with the progressive denoising process, establishing a more consistent learning signal. As a result, it mitigates data bias without sacrificing training stability. Experiments show that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion-based MDE, particularly excelling in reconstructing detailed and accurate depth in far-range regions.</p></details> |  | None |

This work introduces a drone detection methodology built upon the medium-sized YOLOv11 object detection model. To enhance its performance on small targets, we implemented a multi-scale approach in which the input image is processed both as a whole and in segmented parts, with subsequent prediction aggregation. We also utilized a copy-paste data augmentation technique to enrich the training dataset with diverse drone and bird examples. Finally, we implemented a post-processing technique that leverages frame-to-frame consistency to mitigate missed detections.

Although transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable results, their high computational cost hinders clinical deployment. To address this issue, we propose TM-UNet, a novel lightweight framework that integrates token sequence modeling with an efficient memory mechanism for efficient medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale token-memory (MSTM) block that transforms 2D spatial features into token sequences through strategic spatial scanning, leveraging matrix memory cells to selectively retain and propagate discriminative contextual information across tokens. This novel token-memory mechanism acts as a dynamic knowledge store that captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient global reasoning without redundant computation. Our MSTM block further incorporates exponential gating to identify token effectiveness and multi-scale contextual extraction via parallel pooling operations, enabling hierarchical representation learning without computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TM-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse medical segmentation tasks with substantially reduced computation cost.

To bridge these gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench}) based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion) transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

However, existing methods are limited by Fa}lse Negatives (FaNe) induced by semantically similar texts and insufficient fine-grained cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose FaNe, a semantic-enhanced VLP framework. To mitigate false negatives, we introduce a semantic-aware positive pair mining strategy based on text-text similarity with adaptive normalization. Furthermore, we design a text-conditioned sparse attention pooling module to enable fine-grained image-text alignment through localized visual representations guided by textual cues. To strengthen intra-modal discrimination, we develop a hard-negative aware contrastive loss that adaptively reweights semantically similar negatives. Extensive experiments on five downstream medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FaNe achieves state-of-the-art performance across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, validating the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

This paper presents an AI-powered system to automate traffic violation detection, significantly enhancing enforcement efficiency and road safety. The system leverages YOLOv8 for robust object detection and EasyOCR for license plate recognition. Trained on a custom dataset of annotated images (augmented for diversity), it identifies helmet non-compliance, the absence of rear-view mirrors on motorcycles, an innovative contribution to automated checks, and extracts vehicle registration numbers. A Streamlit-based interface facilitates real-time monitoring and violation logging. Advanced image preprocessing enhances license plate recognition, particularly under challenging conditions. Based on evaluation results, the model achieves an overall precision of 0.9147, a recall of 0.886, and a mean Average Precision (mAP@50) of 0.843. The mAP@50 95 of 0.503 further indicates strong detection capability under stricter IoU thresholds. This work demonstrates a practical and effective solution for automated traffic rule enforcement, with considerations for real-world deployment discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[GeoMVD: Geometry-Enhanced Multi-View Generation Model Based on Geometric Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12204v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view image generation holds significant application value in computer vision, particularly in domains like 3D reconstruction, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Most existing methods, which rely on extending single images, face notable computational challenges in maintaining cross-view consistency and generating high-resolution outputs. To address these issues, we propose the Geometry-guided Multi-View Diffusion Model, which incorporates mechanisms for extracting multi-view geometric information and adjusting the intensity of geometric features to generate images that are both consistent across views and rich in detail. Specifically, we design a multi-view geometry information extraction module that leverages depth maps, normal maps, and foreground segmentation masks to construct a shared geometric structure, ensuring shape and structural consistency across different views. To enhance consistency and detail restoration during generation, we develop a decoupled geometry-enhanced attention mechanism that strengthens feature focus on key geometric details, thereby improving overall image quality and detail preservation. Furthermore, we apply an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes the model to better capture spatial relationships and visual coherence between the generated views, ensuring realistic results. Our model also incorporates an iterative refinement process that progressively improves the output quality through multiple stages of image generation. Finally, a dynamic geometry information intensity adjustment mechanism is proposed to adaptively regulate the influence of geometric data, optimizing overall quality while ensuring the naturalness of generated images.

However, these methods often suffer from shape and texture misalignment across generated multi-view images, leading to low-quality 3D generation results, such as incomplete geometric details and textural ghosting. Some methods are mainly optimized for the frontal perspective and exhibit poor robustness to oblique perspective inputs. In this paper, to tackle the above challenges, we propose a high-quality image-to-3D approach, named LSS3D, with learnable spatial shifting to explicitly and effectively handle the multiview inconsistencies and non-frontal input view. Specifically, we assign learnable spatial shifting parameters to each view, and adjust each view towards a spatially consistent target, guided by the reconstructed mesh, resulting in high-quality 3D generation with more complete geometric details and clean textures. Besides, we include the input view as an extra constraint for the optimization, further enhancing robustness to non-frontal input angles, especially for elevated viewpoint inputs. We also provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation pipeline that can contribute to the community in performance comparisons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves leading results in both geometric and texture evaluation metrics across more flexible input viewpoints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MPD-SGR: Robust Spiking Neural Networks with Membrane Potential Distribution-Driven Surrogate Gradient Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12199v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surrogate gradient (SG) method has shown significant promise in enhancing the performance of deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), but it also introduces vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and its implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potential lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG function variants, and spike encoding schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[A Segmentation-driven Editing Method for Bolt Defect Augmentation and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10509v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines. However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset. First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed method.

Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS). Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. Furthermore, SynSeg is a lightweight end-to-end solution without using any mid-term output from large-scale pretrained models and capable for real-time inference. In general, SynSeg effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination under weak supervision in an efficient manner. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Particularly, SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines with a ratio from 6.9\% up to 26.2\%.</p></details> |  | None |

While flow-based inversion-free methods offer high efficiency by avoiding latent inversion, they often fail to effectively integrate source information, leading to poor background preservation, spatial inconsistencies, and over-editing due to the lack of effective integration of source information. In this paper, we present FIA-Edit, a novel inversion-free framework that achieves high-fidelity and semantically precise edits through a Frequency-Interactive Attention. Specifically, we design two key components: (1) a Frequency Representation Interaction (FRI) module that enhances cross-domain alignment by exchanging frequency components between source and target features within self-attention, and (2) a Feature Injection (FIJ) module that explicitly incorporates source-side queries, keys, values, and text embeddings into the target branch's cross-attention to preserve structure and semantics. Comprehensive and extensive experiments demonstrate that FIA-Edit supports high-fidelity editing at low computational cost (~6s per 512 * 512 image on an RTX 4090) and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse tasks in visual quality, background fidelity, and controllability. Furthermore, we are the first to extend text-guided image editing to clinical applications. By synthesizing anatomically coherent hemorrhage variations in surgical images, FIA-Edit opens new opportunities for medical data augmentation and delivers significant gains in downstream bleeding classification.

However, their performance often declines when applied to data from different domains, primarily due to domain shift - the variation in data distributions between source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets - including HCTP, a newly introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset - we conduct a systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability while reducing the computational cost of model training. DoSReMC can be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and generalizable mammography classification systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing work has primarily focused on text-only scenario and largely overlooked the role of multimodality. We introduce MAVIS, the first benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal source attribution systems that understand user intent behind visual questions, retrieve multimodal evidence, and generate long-form answers with citations. Our dataset comprises 157K visual QA instances, where each answer is annotated with fact-level citations referring to multimodal documents. We develop fine-grained automatic metrics along three dimensions of informativeness, groundedness, and fluency, and demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgments. Our key findings are threefold: (1) LVLMs with multimodal RAG generate more informative and fluent answers than unimodal RAG, but they exhibit weaker groundedness for image documents than for text documents, a gap amplified in multimodal settings. (2) Given the same multimodal documents, there is a trade-off between informativeness and groundedness across different prompting methods. (3) Our proposed method highlights mitigating contextual bias in interpreting image documents as a crucial direction for future research.

Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 12pages, 6 figures | None |

While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we construct a polarization imaging system and curate a new dataset of over 13,000 paired Polar-H&E images. Visualizations of polarization properties reveal distinctive optical signatures in pathological tissues, underscoring its diagnostic value. Building on this dataset, we propose PolarHE, a dual-modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the latter ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> | None |

Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> | None |

While supervised methods achieve strong performance, their reliance on extensive pairwise annotations limits scalability. Unsupervised alternatives avoid annotation costs but suffer from noisy pseudo-labels due to intrinsic cross-view domain gaps. To address these limitations, we propose $\textit{UniABG}$, a novel dual-stage unsupervised cross-view geo-localization framework integrating adversarial view bridging with graph-based correspondence calibration.

We present DCMM-Transformer, a novel ViT architecture for medical image analysis that incorporates a Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership (DCMM) model as an additive bias in self-attention. Unlike prior approaches that rely on multiplicative masking and binary sampling, our method introduces community structure and degree heterogeneity in a fully differentiable and interpretable manner. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets, including brain, chest, breast, and ocular modalities, demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of the proposed approach.

However, existing methods often fail to recover fine texture details. This limitation stems from the inherent lack of high-frequency information in LR inputs. To address this, we propose \textbf{SRSplat}, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs high-resolution 3D scenes from only a few LR views. Our main insight is to compensate for the deficiency of texture information by jointly leveraging external high-quality reference images and internal texture cues. We first construct a scene-specific reference gallery, generated for each scene using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and diffusion models. To integrate this external information, we introduce the \textit{Reference-Guided Feature Enhancement (RGFE)} module, which aligns and fuses features from the LR input images and their reference twin image. Subsequently, we train a decoder to predict the Gaussian primitives using the multi-view fused feature obtained from \textit{RGFE}. To further refine predicted Gaussian primitives, we introduce \textit{Texture-Aware Density Control (TADC)}, which adaptively adjusts Gaussian density based on the internal texture richness of the LR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SRSplat outperforms existing methods on various datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU, and exhibits strong cross-dataset and cross-resolution generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI2...</summary><p>AAAI2026-Oral.

Existing methods typically rely solely on the model itself to learn semantic dependencies among visual token sequences. However, directly learning such semantic dependencies from data is challenging because the individual tokens lack clear semantic meanings, and these sequences are usually long. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Knowledge-Augmented Masked Image Generation framework, named KA-MIG, which introduces explicit knowledge of token-level semantic dependencies (\emph{i.e.}, extracted from the training data) as priors to learn richer representations for improving performance. In particular, we explore and identify three types of advantageous token knowledge graphs, including two positive and one negative graphs (\emph{i.e.}, the co-occurrence graph, the semantic similarity graph, and the position-token incompatibility graph). Based on three prior knowledge graphs, we design a graph-aware encoder to learn token and position-aware representations. After that, a lightweight fusion mechanism is introduced to integrate these enriched representations into the existing MIG methods. Resorting to such prior knowledge, our method effectively enhances the model's ability to capture semantic dependencies, leading to improved generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves upon existing MIG for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet.</p></details> | AAAI-26 | None |

We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

This paper presents a novel multi-camera computer vision framework for real-time safety assessment through Post-Encroachment Time (PET) computation, demonstrated at the intersection of H Street and Broadway in Chula Vista, California. Four synchronized cameras provide continuous visual coverage, with each frame processed on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier devices using YOLOv11 segmentation for vehicle detection. Detected vehicle polygons are transformed into a unified bird's-eye map using homography matrices, enabling alignment across overlapping camera views. A novel pixel-level PET algorithm measures vehicle position without reliance on fixed cells, allowing fine-grained hazard visualization via dynamic heatmaps, accurate to 3.3 sq-cm. Timestamped vehicle and PET data is stored in an SQL database for long-term monitoring. Results over various time intervals demonstrate the framework's ability to identify high-risk regions with sub-second precision and real-time throughput on edge devices, producing data for an 800 x 800 pixel logarithmic heatmap at an average of 2.68 FPS. This study validates the feasibility of decentralized vision-based PET analysis for intelligent transportation systems, offering a replicable methodology for high-resolution, real-time, and scalable intersection safety evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[AniMer+: Unified Pose and Shape Estimation Across Mammalia and Aves via Family-Aware Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00298v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TPAMI2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing probabilistic verification methods often fail to scale with the complexity and dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, producing guarantees that are overly conservative and of limited practical value. We propose a probabilistic verification framework that is architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional input-output spaces. Our approach employs conformal inference (CI), enhanced by a novel technique that we call the \textbf{clipping block}, to provide provable guarantees while mitigating the excessive conservatism of prior methods. Experiments on large-scale segmentation models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrate that our framework delivers reliable safety guarantees while substantially reducing conservatism compared to state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation tasks. We also provide a public GitHub repository (https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/SSN_Reach_CLP_Surrogate) for this approach, to support reproducibility.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/SSN_Reach_CLP_Surrogate) |

The investigated architectures were: (1) BEGL-UNet with Border-Enhanced Gaussian Loss function; (2) Attention-Residual BEGL-UNet, incorporating residual blocks and gated attention mechanisms; and (3) Spatial Channel Attention BEGL-UNet, which employs spatial-channel attention modules based on Convolutional Block Attention Module. All implementations employed the BEGL loss function combining binary cross-entropy with Gaussian edge enhancement. Experiments were conducted on images from the Poço da Bebidinha Archaeological Complex, Piauí, Brazil, using 5-fold cross-validation. Among the architectures, Attention-Residual BEGL-UNet achieved the best overall performance with Dice Score of 0.710, validation loss of 0.067, and highest recall of 0.854. Spatial Channel Attention BEGL-UNet obtained comparable performance with DSC of 0.707 and recall of 0.857. The baseline BEGL-UNet registered DSC of 0.690. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of attention mechanisms for archaeological heritage digital preservation, with Dice Score improvements of 2.5-2.9% over the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Prompt Triage: Structured Optimization Enhances Vision-Language Model Performance on Medical Imaging Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11898v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) show promise for diverse imaging tasks but often underperform on medical benchmarks. Prior efforts to improve performance include model finetuning, which requires large domain-specific datasets and significant compute, or manual prompt engineering, which is hard to generalize and often inaccessible to medical institutions seeking to deploy these tools. These challenges motivate interest in approaches that draw on a model's embedded knowledge while abstracting away dependence on human-designed prompts to enable scalable, weight-agnostic performance improvements. To explore this, we adapt the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) framework for structured automated prompt optimization in medical vision-language systems through a comprehensive, formal evaluation. We implement prompting pipelines for five medical imaging tasks across radiology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, evaluating 10 open-source VLMs with four prompt optimization techniques. Optimized pipelines achieved a median relative improvement of 53% over zero-shot prompting baselines, with the largest gains ranging from 300% to 3,400% on tasks where zero-shot performance is low. These results highlight the substantial potential of applying automated prompt optimization to medical AI systems, demonstrating significant gains for vision-based applications requiring accurate clinical image interpretation. By reducing dependence on prompt design to elicit intended outputs, these techniques allow clinicians to focus on patient care and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, our experiments offer scalability and preserve data privacy, demonstrating performance improvement on open-source VLMs. We publicly release our evaluation pipelines to support reproducible research on specialized medical tasks, available at https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab) |

This paper presents a novel transformer-based learning framework to address the single-channel noise suppression problem for real-time applications. Although existing deep learning networks have shown remarkable improvements in handling stationary noise, their performance often diminishes in real-world environments characterized by non-stationary noise (e.g., dog barking, baby crying). The proposed dual-input acoustic-image feature fusion using a hybrid ViT framework effectively models both temporal and spectral dependencies in noisy signals. Designed for real-world audio environments, the proposed framework is computationally lightweight and suitable for implementation on embedded devices. To evaluate its effectiveness, four standard and commonly used quality measurements, namely PESQ, STOI, Seg SNR, and LLR, are utilized. Experimental results obtained using the Librispeech dataset as the clean speech source and the UrbanSound8K and Google Audioset datasets as the noise sources, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves noise reduction, speech intelligibility, and perceptual quality compared to the noisy input signal, achieving performance close to the clean reference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Weyl-Heisenberg Transform Capabilities in JPEG Compression Standard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11766v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is devoted to the development and research of a new compression technology based on Weyl-Heisenberg bases (WH-technology) for modifying the JPEG compression standard and improving its characteristics. For this purpose, the paper analyzes the main stages of the JPEG compression algorithm, notes its key features and problems that limit further enhancement of its efficiency. To overcome these limitations, it is proposed to use the real version of the two-dimensional discrete orthogonal Weyl-Heisenberg transform (DWHT) instead of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the stage of transformation coding. This transformation, unlike DCT, initially has a block structure and is built on the basis of the Weyl-Heisenberg optimal signal basis, the functions of which are orthogonal and well localized both in the frequency and time domains. This feature of DWHT allows for more efficient decorrelation and compression of element values in each block of the image after transformation coding. As a result, it is possible to obtain more efficient selection and screening of insignificant elements at the subsequent stages of quantization and information coding. Based on DWHT, a new version of the JPEG compression algorithm was developed, and convenient criteria for evaluating the compression efficiency and metrics of quality losses were proposed. The results of an experimental study are presented, confirming the higher compression efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the JPEG compression standard.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OpenUS: A Fully Open-Source Foundation Model for Ultrasound Image Analysis via Self-Adaptive Masked Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11510v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning.

| **[ImAgent: A Unified Multimodal Agent Framework for Test-Time Scalable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11483v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 6 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection via Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01603v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In AI-generated image detection, current cutting-edge methods typically adapt pre-trained foundation models through partial-parameter fine-tuning. However, these approaches often struggle to generalize to forgeries from unseen generators, as the fine-tuned models capture only limited patterns from training data and fail to reflect the evolving traits of new ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), a novel paradigm that dynamically adjusts the prompts fed into the encoder according to each testing image, rather than fixing them after training. This design significantly enhances robustness and adaptability to diverse forged images. The dynamic prompts integrate conditional information with test-time adaptive tokens through a lightweight learnable scaling factor. The conditional information is produced by a Conditional Information Learner, which leverages CNN-based feature extractors to model both forgery-specific and general conditions. The test-time adaptive tokens are optimized during inference on a single sample by enforcing prediction consistency across multiple views, ensuring that the parameters align with the current image. For the final decision, the optimal input with the highest prediction confidence is selected. Extensive experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mean accuracies of 95.61% and 96.7% on the widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage datasets, respectively.

Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, Under review</p></details> | None |

For example, the Sigmoid activation is the de-facto activation in balanced classification tasks, however, in imbalanced classification, it proves inappropriate due to bias towards frequent classes. In this work, we delve deeper in this phenomenon by performing a comprehensive statistical analysis in the classification and intermediate layers of both balanced and imbalanced networks and we empirically show that aligning the activation function with the data distribution, enhances the performance in both balanced and imbalanced tasks. To this end, we propose the Adaptive Parametric Activation (APA) function, a novel and versatile activation function that unifies most common activation functions under a single formula. APA can be applied in both intermediate layers and attention layers, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art on several imbalanced benchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist2018, Places-LT, CIFAR100-LT and LVIS. Also, we extend APA to a plethora of other tasks such as classification, detection, visual instruction following tasks, image generation and next-text-token prediction benchmarks.

Nevertheless, these methods suffer from severe content degradation within video chunks. Furthermore, the absence of a robust frame alignment scheme compromises intra-chunk and inter-chunk spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the entire video. To address these limitations, we propose VidPivot, a novel framework that decouples video inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation. Our approach introduces frame interval priors as spatiotemporal cues to guide the inpainting process. To enhance cross-frame coherence, we design a FrameProp Module that implements a frame content propagation strategy, diffusing reference frame content into subsequent frames via a splicing mechanism. Additionally, a dedicated context controller encodes these coherent frame priors into the I2V generative backbone, effectively serving as soft constrain to suppress content distortion during generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidPivot achieves competitive performance across diverse benchmarks and generalizes well to different video inpainting scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git) |

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Mixing Architecture for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15497v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of deep learning, low-light RAW image enhancement (LLRIE) has achieved remarkable progress. However, the challenge that how to simultaneously achieve strong enhancement quality and high efficiency still remains. Leveraging the inherent efficiency of Channel Attention and Mamba, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA), a hybrid LLRIE framework built upon two core modules. Specifically, we introduce Large Scale Block (LSB) for upper layers and Small Scale Block (SSB) for lower layers that reduce the parameters while improve the performance. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel Local Distribution Adjustment (LoDA) module that adaptively aligns local feature statistics in a content-aware manner by learning to adjust regional luminance and contrast distributions. Moreover, to alleviate the domain ambiguity commonly observed in existing LLRIE pipelines, we design a Multi-Prior Fusion (MPF) module that leverages three complementary priors extracted from the first stage of the hybrid architecture to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior performance with fewer parameters.

| **[Deep Learning-Enhanced Analysis for Delineating Anticoagulant Essay Efficacy Using Phase Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11158v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The coagulation of blood after it is drawn from the body poses a significant challenge for hematological analysis, potentially leading to inaccurate test results and altered cellular characteristics, compromising diagnostic reliability. This paper presents a deep learning-enhanced framework for delineating anticoagulant efficacy ex vivo using Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM). We demonstrate a label-free, non-invasive approach for analyzing human blood samples, capable of accurate cell counting and morphological estimation. A DHM with an automated image processing and deep learning pipeline is built for morphological analysis of the blood cells under two different anti-coagulation agents, e.g. conventional EDTA and novel potassium ferric oxalate nanoparticles (KFeOx-NPs). This enables automated high-throughput screening of cells and estimation of blood coagulation rates when samples are treated with different anticoagulants. Results indicated that KFeOx-NPs prevented human blood coagulation without altering the cellular morphology of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas EDTA incubation caused notable changes within 6 hours of incubation. The system allows for quantitative analysis of coagulation dynamics by assessing parameters like cell clustering and morphology over time in these prepared samples, offering insights into the comparative efficacy and effects of anticoagulants outside the body.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities. Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse) |
| **[Enhancing Meme Emotion Understanding with Multi-Level Modality Enhancement and Dual-Stage Modal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11126v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

| **[MILD: Multi-Layer Diffusion Strategy for Complex and Precise Multi-IP Aware Human Erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06543v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in image customization tasks. However, existing mask-guided human erasing methods still struggle in complex scenarios such as human-human occlusion, human-object entanglement, and human-background interference, mainly due to the lack of large-scale multi-instance datasets and effective spatial decoupling to separate foreground from background. To bridge these gaps, we curate the MILD dataset capturing diverse poses, occlusions, and complex multi-instance interactions. We then define the Cross-Domain Attention Gap (CAG), an attention-gap metric to quantify semantic leakage. On top of these, we propose Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD), which decomposes the generation process into independent denoising pathways, enabling separate reconstruction of each foreground instance and the background. To enhance human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance, a plug-and-play module that incorporates pose, parsing, and spatial relationships into the diffusion process to improve structural awareness and restoration quality. Additionally, we present Spatially-Modulated Attention, an adaptive mechanism that leverages spatial mask priors to modulate attention across semantic regions, further widening the CAG to effectively minimize boundary artifacts and mitigate semantic leakage. Experiments show that MILD significantly outperforms existing methods. Datasets and code are publicly available at: https://mild-multi-layer-diffusion.github.io/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://mild-multi-layer-diffusion.github.io/) |
| **[AccKV: Towards Efficient Audio-Video LLMs Inference via Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV Cache Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11106v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) have enhanced their capabilities in tasks like audio-visual question answering and multimodal dialog systems. Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities. The experimental results show that AccKV can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Active Contour Models Driven by Hyperbolic Mean Curvature Flow for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06712v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are widely used for image segmentation, yet they suffer severe degradation under high-intensity noise because gradient-descent evolutions exhibit the well-known zig-zag phenomenon. To overcome this drawback, we propose hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs). This novel framework incorporates an adjustable acceleration field to autonomously regulate curve evolution smoothness, providing dual degrees of freedom for adaptive selection of both initial contours and velocity fields. We rigorously prove that HMCF-ACMs are normal flows and establish their numerical equivalence to wave equations through a level set formulation with signed distance functions. An efficient numerical scheme combining spectral discretization and optimized temporal integration is developed to solve the governing equations, and its stability condition is derived through Fourier analysis. Extensive experiments on natural and medical images validate that HMCF-ACMs achieve superior performance under high-noise conditions, demonstrating reduced parameter sensitivity, enhanced noise robustness, and improved segmentation accuracy compared to PMCF-ACMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SemanticNN: Compressive and Error-Resilient Semantic Offloading for Extremely Weak Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11038v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MRT: Learning Compact Representations with Mixed RWKV-Transformer for Extreme Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06717v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in extreme image compression have revealed that mapping pixel data into highly compact latent representations can significantly improve coding efficiency. However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

While vision-centric methods suffer from geometric inaccuracies, LiDAR-based approaches often lack rich semantic information. To address these limitations, MS-Occ, a novel multi-stage LiDAR-camera fusion framework which includes middle-stage fusion and late-stage fusion, is proposed, integrating LiDAR's geometric fidelity with camera-based semantic richness via hierarchical cross-modal fusion. The framework introduces innovations at two critical stages: (1) In the middle-stage feature fusion, the Gaussian-Geo module leverages Gaussian kernel rendering on sparse LiDAR depth maps to enhance 2D image features with dense geometric priors, and the Semantic-Aware module enriches LiDAR voxels with semantic context via deformable cross-attention; (2) In the late-stage voxel fusion, the Adaptive Fusion (AF) module dynamically balances voxel features across modalities, while the High Classification Confidence Voxel Fusion (HCCVF) module resolves semantic inconsistencies using self-attention-based refinement. Experiments on two large-scale benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On nuScenes-OpenOccupancy, MS-Occ achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 32.1% and a mean IoU (mIoU) of 25.3%, surpassing the state-of-the-art by +0.7% IoU and +2.4% mIoU. Furthermore, on the SemanticKITTI benchmark, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art mIoU of 24.08%, robustly validating its generalization capabilities.Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each individual module, highlighting substantial improvements in the perception of small objects and reinforcing the practical value of MS-Occ for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

However, despite advancements, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs performance in multi-object sentiment analysis, a key task in semantic understanding. To address this gap, we introduce MOSABench, a novel evaluation dataset designed specifically for multi-object sentiment analysis. MOSABench includes approximately 1,000 images with multiple objects, requiring MLLMs to independently assess the sentiment of each object, thereby reflecting real-world complexities. Key innovations in MOSABench include distance-based target annotation, post-processing for evaluation to standardize outputs, and an improved scoring mechanism. Our experiments reveal notable limitations in current MLLMs: while some models, like mPLUG-owl and Qwen-VL2, demonstrate effective attention to sentiment-relevant features, others exhibit scattered focus and performance declines, especially as the spatial distance between objects increases. This research underscores the need for MLLMs to enhance accuracy in complex, multi-object sentiment analysis tasks and establishes MOSABench as a foundational tool for advancing sentiment analysis capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of fine-tuning for stability enhancement.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |

However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The results confirmed that the proposed model outperformed YOLOv8 by 0.1% in mAP (0.5) and surpassed YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.</p></details> |  | None |

Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning approaches such as CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced this field, they often struggle with complex or high-resolution blur and computational demands. We propose a new dual-domain architecture that unifies Vision Transformers with a frequency-domain FFT-ReLU module, explicitly bridging spatial attention modeling and frequency sparsity. In this structure, the ViT backbone captures local and global dependencies, while the FFT-ReLU component enforces frequency-domain sparsity to suppress blur-related artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this architecture achieves superior PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Both quantitative metrics, qualitative comparisons, and human preference evaluations confirm its effectiveness, establishing a practical and generalizable paradigm for real-world image restoration.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.</p></details> | 2 figures, 11 pages | None |
| **[Panda: Test-Time Adaptation with Negative Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10481v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a "detect-and-refine" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lane Departure Accident Prevention in Foggy Conditions: A Prior-Guided Dynamic Feature Fusion Transformer Framework for Real-Time Lane Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06121v11)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane departure accident prevention plays a critical role in enhancing road safety, and lane detection is a core technology to achieve this goal, especially under complex weather conditions. While existing lane detection algorithms perform well under favorable weather conditions, their effectiveness significantly degrades in foggy environments, which increases the risk of traffic accidents. In response to this challenge, we propose PDT-Net, a robust Prior-Guided Dynamic Feature Fusion Transformer framework designed for real-time lane detection in foggy conditions. This framework integrates three key modules: a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture the relationship between local and global features in foggy images, a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Prior-Guided Edge Enhancement Module (PEM) to recover lost edge details in foggy environments. Furthermore, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, a real-world dataset that specifically targets lane detection in foggy conditions, along with two synthesized datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, to address the lack of fog-specific data for lane detection. Extensive experiments show that PDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with F1-scores of 95.04% on FoggyLane, 79.85% on FoggyCULane, and 96.95% on FoggyTusimple. Moreover, with TensorRT acceleration, our method achieves a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capability and robustness in challenging foggy environments. By improving the precision of lane detection, our framework can contribute to active safety warning systems, helping to prevent accidents in foggy conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[National Institute on Aging PREPARE Challenge: Early Detection of Cognitive Impairment Using Speech -- The SpeechCARE Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08132v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Depth-Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting via Physical Defocus Modeling and Multi-View Geometric Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10316v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent transformer-based single-image monocular depth estimation models perform well on single images but struggle with depth consistency across video frames. Traditional methods aim to improve temporal consistency using multi-frame temporal modules or prior information like optical flow and camera parameters. However, these approaches face issues such as high memory use, reduced performance with dynamic or irregular motion, and limited motion understanding. We propose STATIC, a novel model that independently learns temporal consistency in static and dynamic area without additional information. A difference mask from surface normals identifies static and dynamic area by measuring directional variance. For static area, the Masked Static (MS) module enhances temporal consistency by focusing on stable regions. For dynamic area, the Surface Normal Similarity (SNS) module aligns areas and enhances temporal consistency by measuring feature similarity between frames. A final refinement integrates the independently learned static and dynamic area, enabling STATIC to achieve temporal consistency across the entire sequence. Our method achieves state-of-the-art video depth estimation on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets without additional information.</p></details> |  | None |

While reconstruction methods such as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687 annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO), together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research.

This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2026</p></details> | None |

Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.</p></details> |  | None |

In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent advancements have explored optimization-based and learning-based layer-wise image vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://layerpeeler.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor (SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global semantics.

| **[Perceive, Act and Correct: Confidence Is Not Enough for Hyperspectral Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10068v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Image Aesthetic Reasoning via HCM-GRPO: Empowering Compact Model for Superior Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10055v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MuSc-V2: Zero-Shot Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Classification and Segmentation with Mutual Scoring of Unlabeled Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10047v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) methods aim to identify and outline defects without using any labeled samples. In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\textbf{+23.7\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\textbf{+19.3\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

This paper proposes TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed to achieve accurate and efficient detection of transmission line defects from UAV-acquired images. The model integrates four major components: an edge-enhanced ResNet backbone to strengthen boundary-sensitive representations, a stride-free space-to-depth module to enable detail-preserving downsampling, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention mechanism to jointly model global context and local cues, and a Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve the localization of small and difficult objects. Together, these designs effectively mitigate the limitations of conventional detectors. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR achieves superior detection performance and strong generalization capability, while maintaining modest computational overhead. The accuracy and efficiency of TinyDef-DETR make it a suitable method for UAV-based transmission line defect detection, particularly in scenarios involving small and ambiguous objects.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing multi-modal sarcasm detection approaches have been shown to excessively depend on superficial cues within the textual modality, exhibiting limited capability to accurately discern sarcasm through subtle text-image interactions. To address this limitation, a novel framework, InterCLIP-MEP, is proposed. This framework integrates Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP), which employs an efficient training strategy to derive enriched cross-modal representations by embedding inter-modal information directly into each encoder, while using approximately 20.6$\times$ fewer trainable parameters compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP) is introduced, featuring a dynamic dual-channel memory mechanism that captures and retains valuable knowledge from test samples during inference, serving as a non-parametric classifier to enhance sarcasm detection robustness. Extensive experiments on MMSD, MMSD2.0, and DocMSU show that InterCLIP-MEP achieves SOTA performance, specifically improving accuracy by 1.08% and F1 score by 1.51% on MMSD2.0. Under distributional shift evaluation, it attains 73.96% accuracy, exceeding its memory-free variant by nearly 10% and the previous SOTA by over 15%, demonstrating superior stability and adaptability.

| **[Mitigating Perception Bias: A Training-Free Approach to Enhance LMM for Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12791v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in high-level visual tasks, their capacity for image quality assessment (IQA) remains limited. One main reason is that LMMs are primarily trained for high-level tasks (e.g., image captioning), emphasizing unified image semantics extraction under varied quality. Such semantic-aware yet quality-insensitive perception bias inevitably leads to a heavy reliance on image semantics when those LMMs are forced for quality rating. In this paper, instead of retraining or tuning an LMM costly, we propose a training-free debiasing framework, in which the image quality prediction is rectified by mitigating the bias caused by image semantics. Specifically, we first explore several semantic-preserving distortions that can significantly degrade image quality while maintaining identifiable semantics. By applying these specific distortions to the query or test images, we ensure that the degraded images are recognized as poor quality while their semantics mainly remain. During quality inference, both a query image and its corresponding degraded version are fed to the LMM along with a prompt indicating that the query image quality should be inferred under the condition that the degraded one is deemed poor quality. This prior condition effectively aligns the LMM's quality perception, as all degraded images are consistently rated as poor quality, regardless of their semantic variance. Finally, the quality scores of the query image inferred under different prior conditions (degraded versions) are aggregated using a conditional probability model. Extensive experiments on various IQA datasets show that our debiasing framework could consistently enhance the LMM performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method is compatible with previous problem-agnostic DMIR methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs.

| **[Autonomous Concept Drift Threshold Determination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09953v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$.

| **[MCM: Multi-layer Concept Map for Efficient Concept Learning from Masked Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00266v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masking strategies commonly employed in natural language processing are still underexplored in vision tasks such as concept learning, where conventional methods typically rely on full images. However, using masked images diversifies perceptual inputs, potentially offering significant advantages in concept learning with large-scale Transformer models. To this end, we propose Multi-layer Concept Map (MCM), the first work to devise an efficient concept learning method based on masked images. In particular, we introduce an asymmetric concept learning architecture by establishing correlations between different encoder and decoder layers, updating concept tokens using backward gradients from reconstruction tasks. The learned concept tokens at various levels of granularity help either reconstruct the masked image patches by filling in gaps or guide the reconstruction results in a direction that reflects specific concepts. Moreover, we present both quantitative and qualitative results across a wide range of metrics, demonstrating that MCM significantly reduces computational costs by training on fewer than 75% of the total image patches while enhancing concept prediction performance. Additionally, editing specific concept tokens in the latent space enables targeted image generation from masked images, aligning both the visible contextual patches and the provided concepts. By further adjusting the testing time mask ratio, we could produce a range of reconstructions that blend the visible patches with the provided concepts, proportional to the chosen ratios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MAUGIF: Mechanism-Aware Unsupervised General Image Fusion via Dual Cross-Image Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08272v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion aims to integrate structural and complementary information from multi-source images. However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.

Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.</p></details> | Accepted in WACV2026 | None |

However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures.

We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Fourier-Based Global Denoising Model for Smart Artifacts Removing of Microscopy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09734v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopy such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are essential tools in material imaging at micro- and nanoscale resolutions to extract physical knowledge and materials structure-property relationships. However, tuning microscopy controls (e.g. scanning speed, current setpoint, tip bias etc.) to obtain a high-quality of images is a non-trivial and time-consuming effort. On the other hand, with sub-standard images, the key features are not accurately discovered due to noise and artifacts, leading to erroneous analysis. Existing denoising models mostly build on generalizing the weak signals as noises while the strong signals are enhanced as key features, which is not always the case in microscopy images, thus can completely erase a significant amount of hidden physical information. To address these limitations, we propose a global denoising model (GDM) to smartly remove artifacts of microscopy images while preserving weaker but physically important features. The proposed model is developed based on 1) first designing a two-imaging input channel of non-pair and goal specific pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off information between two channels and 2) then integrating a loss function of pixel- and fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) based on training the U-net model. We compared the proposed GDM with the non-FFT denoising model over STM-generated images of Copper(Cu) and Silicon(Si) materials, AFM-generated Pantoea sp.YR343 bio-film images and SEM-generated plastic degradation images. We believe this proposed workflow can be extended to improve other microscopy image quality and will benefit the experimentalists with the proposed design flexibility to smartly tune via domain-experts preferences.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures | None |

The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this raises an important question: do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images. EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8 essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content. Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks. Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI.

Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

Recent studies have demonstrated the practical advantages of Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS), notably its ability to achieve stable information embedding and extraction without any additional network training. However, the stego images generated by FNNS still exhibit noticeable distortion and limited robustness. These drawbacks compromise the security of the embedded information and restrict the practical applicability of the method. To address these limitations, we propose Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography (RFNNS). Specifically, a texture-aware localization technique selectively embeds perturbations carrying secret information into regions of complex textures, effectively preserving visual quality. Additionally, a robust steganographic perturbation generation (RSPG) strategy is designed to enhance the decoding accuracy, even under common and unknown attacks. These robust perturbations are combined with AI-generated cover images to produce stego images. Experimental results demonstrate that RFNNS significantly improves robustness compared to state-of-the-art FNNS methods, achieving an average increase in SSIM of 23\% for recovered secret images under common attacks. Furthermore, the LPIPS value of recovered secrets images against previously unknown attacks achieved by RFNNS was reduced to 39\% of the SOTA method, underscoring its practical value for covert communication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DualVision ArthroNav: Investigating Opportunities to Enhance Localization and Reconstruction in Image-based Arthroscopy Navigation via External Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10699v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arthroscopic procedures can greatly benefit from navigation systems that enhance spatial awareness, depth perception, and field of view. However, existing optical tracking solutions impose strict workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow. Vision-based alternatives, though less invasive, often rely solely on the monocular arthroscope camera, making them prone to drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to rapid motion or occlusion. We propose DualVision ArthroNav, a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope. The external camera provides stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope video enables dense scene reconstruction. By combining these complementary views, our system resolves the scale ambiguity and long-term drift inherent in monocular SLAM and ensures robust relocalization. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively compensates for calibration errors, achieving an average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm. The reconstructed scenes reach an average target registration error of 2.16 mm, with high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19). These results indicate that our system provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation, bridging the gap between optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, and paving the way toward clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FedeCouple: Fine-Grained Balancing of Global-Generalization and Local-Adaptability in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09599v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RL-U$^2$Net: A Dual-Branch UNet with Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Multimodal Feature Fusion for Accurate 3D Whole-Heart Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02557v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal 3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel CAD data annotation engine that leverages intrinsic attributes from systematically archived CAD drawings to automatically generate high-quality annotations, thus significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. Utilizing this engine, we construct ArchCAD-400K, a large-scale CAD dataset consisting of 413,062 chunks from 5538 highly standardized drawings, making it over 26 times larger than the largest existing CAD dataset. ArchCAD-400K boasts an extended drawing diversity and broader categories, offering line-grained annotations. Furthermore, we present a new baseline model for panoptic symbol spotting, termed Dual-Pathway Symbol Spotter (DPSS). It incorporates an adaptive fusion module to enhance primitive features with complementary image features, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DPSS, demonstrating the value of ArchCAD-400K and its potential to drive innovation in architectural design and construction.</p></details> |  | None |
