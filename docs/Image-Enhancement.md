| **[SINET: Sparsity-driven Interpretable Neural Network for Underwater Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01022v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the quality of underwater images is essential for advancing marine research and technology. This work introduces a sparsity-driven interpretable neural network (SINET) for the underwater image enhancement (UIE) task. Unlike pure deep learning methods, our network architecture is based on a novel channel-specific convolutional sparse coding (CCSC) model, ensuring good interpretability of the underlying image enhancement process. The key feature of SINET is that it estimates the salient features from the three color channels using three sparse feature estimation blocks (SFEBs). The architecture of SFEB is designed by unrolling an iterative algorithm for solving the $\ell_1$ regularized convolutional sparse coding (CSC) problem. Our experiments show that SINET surpasses state-of-the-art PSNR value by $1.05$ dB with $3873$ times lower computational complexity.

| **[Zero-Shot Low Light Image Enhancement with Diffusion Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13401v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a simple yet highly effective ``free lunch'' solution for low-light image enhancement (LLIE), which aims to restore low-light images as if acquired in well-illuminated environments. Our method necessitates no training, fine-tuning, text conditioning, or hyperparameter adjustments, yet it consistently reconstructs low-light images with superior fidelity. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion prior, learned from training on a large collection of natural images, and the features present in the model itself to guide the inference, in contrast to existing methods that depend on customized constraints. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms SOTA methods on established datasets, while qualitative analyses indicate enhanced color accuracy and the rectification of subtle chromatic deviations. Furthermore, additional experiments reveal that our method, without any modifications, achieves SOTA-comparable performance in the auto white balance (AWB) task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CARNet: Collaborative Adversarial Resilience for Robust Underwater Image Enhancement and Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01102v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the uneven absorption of different light wavelengths in aquatic environments, underwater images suffer from low visibility and clear color deviations. With the advancement of autonomous underwater vehicles, extensive research has been conducted on learning-based underwater enhancement algorithms. These works can generate visually pleasing enhanced images and mitigate the adverse effects of degraded images on subsequent perception tasks. However, learning-based methods are susceptible to the inherent fragility of adversarial attacks, causing significant disruption in enhanced results. In this work, we introduce a collaborative adversarial resilience network, dubbed CARNet, for underwater image enhancement and subsequent detection tasks. Concretely, we first introduce an invertible network with strong perturbation-perceptual abilities to isolate attacks from underwater images, preventing interference with visual quality enhancement and perceptual tasks. Furthermore, an attack pattern discriminator is introduced to adaptively identify and eliminate various types of attacks. Additionally, we propose a bilevel attack optimization strategy to heighten the robustness of the network against different types of attacks under the collaborative adversarial training of vision-driven and perception-driven attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outputs visually appealing enhancement images and performs an average 6.71% higher detection mAP than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures | None |
| **[DPF-Net: Physical Imaging Model Embedded Data-Driven Underwater Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12470v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the complex interplay of light absorption and scattering in the underwater environment, underwater images experience significant degradation. This research presents a two-stage underwater image enhancement network called the Data-Driven and Physical Parameters Fusion Network (DPF-Net), which harnesses the robustness of physical imaging models alongside the generality and efficiency of data-driven methods. We first train a physical parameter estimate module using synthetic datasets to guarantee the trustworthiness of the physical parameters, rather than solely learning the fitting relationship between raw and reference images by the application of the imaging equation, as is common in prior studies. This module is subsequently trained in conjunction with an enhancement network, where the estimated physical parameters are integrated into a data-driven model within the embedding space. To maintain the uniformity of the restoration process amid underwater imaging degradation, we propose a physics-based degradation consistency loss. Additionally, we suggest an innovative weak reference loss term utilizing the entire dataset, which alleviates our model's reliance on the quality of individual reference images. Our proposed DPF-Net demonstrates superior performance compared to other benchmark methods across multiple test sets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

| **[DPEC: Dual-Path Error Compensation Method for Enhanced Low-Light Image Clarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09553v5)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the task of low-light image enhancement, deep learning-based algorithms have demonstrated superiority and effectiveness compared to traditional methods. However, these methods, primarily based on Retinex theory, tend to overlook the noise and color distortions in input images, leading to significant noise amplification and local color distortions in enhanced results. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Path Error Compensation (DPEC) method, designed to improve image quality under low-light conditions by preserving local texture details while restoring global image brightness without amplifying noise. DPEC incorporates precise pixel-level error estimation to capture subtle differences and an independent denoising mechanism to prevent noise amplification. We introduce the HIS-Retinex loss to guide DPEC's training, ensuring the brightness distribution of enhanced images closely aligns with real-world conditions. To balance computational speed and resource efficiency while training DPEC for a comprehensive understanding of the global context, we integrated the VMamba architecture into its backbone. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in low-light image enhancement. The code is publicly available online at https://github.com/wangshuang233/DPEC.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/wangshuang233/DPEC) |
| **[Enhanced Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction by Domain and Task Shifting Gaussian Denoisers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03551v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computed tomography from a low radiation dose (LDCT) is challenging due to high noise in the projection data. Popular approaches for LDCT image reconstruction are two-stage methods, typically consisting of the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm followed by a neural network for LDCT image enhancement. Two-stage methods are attractive for their simplicity and potential for computational efficiency, typically requiring only a single FBP and a neural network forward pass for inference. However, the best reconstruction quality is currently achieved by unrolled iterative methods (Learned Primal-Dual and ItNet), which are more complex and thus have a higher computational cost for training and inference. We propose a method combining the simplicity and efficiency of two-stage methods with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Our strategy utilizes a neural network pretrained for Gaussian noise removal from natural grayscale images, fine-tuned for LDCT image enhancement. We call this method FBP-DTSGD (Domain and Task Shifted Gaussian Denoisers) as the fine-tuning is a task shift from Gaussian denoising to enhancing LDCT images and a domain shift from natural grayscale to LDCT images. An ablation study with three different pretrained Gaussian denoisers indicates that the performance of FBP-DTSGD does not depend on a specific denoising architecture, suggesting future advancements in Gaussian denoising could benefit the method. The study also shows that pretraining on natural images enhances LDCT reconstruction quality, especially with limited training data. Notably, pretraining involves no additional cost, as existing pretrained models are used. The proposed method currently holds the top mean position in the LoDoPaB-CT challenge.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Toward Generalized Image Quality Assessment: Relaxing the Perfect Reference Quality Assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11221v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) generally assumes that reference images are of perfect quality. However, this assumption is flawed due to the sensor and optical limitations of modern imaging systems. Moreover, recent generative enhancement methods are capable of producing images of higher quality than their original. All of these challenge the effectiveness and applicability of current FR-IQA models. To relax the assumption of perfect reference image quality, we build a large-scale IQA database, namely DiffIQA, containing approximately 180,000 images generated by a diffusion-based image enhancer with adjustable hyper-parameters. Each image is annotated by human subjects as either worse, similar, or better quality compared to its reference. Building on this, we present a generalized FR-IQA model, namely Adaptive Fidelity-Naturalness Evaluator (A-FINE), to accurately assess and adaptively combine the fidelity and naturalness of a test image. A-FINE aligns well with standard FR-IQA when the reference image is much more natural than the test image. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that A-FINE surpasses standard FR-IQA models on well-established IQA datasets and our newly created DiffIQA. To further validate A-FINE, we additionally construct a super-resolution IQA benchmark (SRIQA-Bench), encompassing test images derived from ten state-of-the-art SR methods with reliable human quality annotations. Tests on SRIQA-Bench re-affirm the advantages of A-FINE. The code and dataset are available at https://tianhewu.github.io/A-FINE-page.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://tianhewu.github.io/A-FINE-page.github.io) |
| **[Multi-Knowledge-oriented Nighttime Haze Imaging Enhancer for Vision-driven Intelligent Transportation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07351v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality and hinder reliable object detection in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-knowledge-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MKoIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MKoIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead to meet the requirements of real-time ITS deployment. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MKoIE surpasses existing methods, enhancing the reliability, accuracy, and operational efficiency of ITS. The code is available at https://github.com/Ai-Chen-Lab/MKoIE.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Ai-Chen-Lab/MKoIE) |
| **[Dream-IF: Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent for Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10109v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion aims to integrate comprehensive information from images acquired through multiple sources. However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[QUIET-SR: Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Single Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08759v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using deep learning have significantly improved image restoration quality. However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. These findings highlight the potential of scalable variational quantum machine learning models for SISR, marking a step toward practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution.</p></details> | 10 figures, 3 pages | None |
| **[PromptLNet: Region-Adaptive Aesthetic Enhancement via Prompt Guidance in Low-Light Enhancement Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08276v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning and improving large language models through human preference feedback has become a mainstream approach, but it has rarely been applied to the field of low-light image enhancement. Existing low-light enhancement evaluations typically rely on objective metrics (such as FID, PSNR, etc.), which often result in models that perform well objectively but lack aesthetic quality. Moreover, most low-light enhancement models are primarily designed for global brightening, lacking detailed refinement. Therefore, the generated images often require additional local adjustments, leading to research gaps in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the following innovations: 1) We collect human aesthetic evaluation text pairs and aesthetic scores from multiple low-light image datasets (e.g., LOL, LOL2, LOM, DCIM, MEF, etc.) to train a low-light image aesthetic evaluation model, supplemented by an optimization algorithm designed to fine-tune the diffusion model. 2) We propose a prompt-driven brightness adjustment module capable of performing fine-grained brightness and aesthetic adjustments for specific instances or regions. 3) We evaluate our method alongside existing state-of-the-art algorithms on mainstream benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms traditional methods in terms of visual quality but also provides greater flexibility and controllability, paving the way for improved aesthetic quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TSCnet: A Text-driven Semantic-level Controllable Framework for Customized Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08168v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based image enhancement methods show significant advantages in reducing noise and improving visibility in low-light conditions. These methods are typically based on one-to-one mapping, where the model learns a direct transformation from low light to specific enhanced images. Therefore, these methods are inflexible as they do not allow highly personalized mapping, even though an individual's lighting preferences are inherently personalized. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new light enhancement task and a new framework that provides customized lighting control through prompt-driven, semantic-level, and quantitative brightness adjustments. The framework begins by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand natural language prompts, enabling it to identify target objects for brightness adjustments. To localize these target objects, the Retinex-based Reasoning Segment (RRS) module generates precise target localization masks using reflection images. Subsequently, the Text-based Brightness Controllable (TBC) module adjusts brightness levels based on the generated illumination map. Finally, an Adaptive Contextual Compensation (ACC) module integrates multi-modal inputs and controls a conditional diffusion model to adjust the lighting, ensuring seamless and precise enhancements accurately. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework's superior performance at increasing visibility, maintaining natural color balance, and amplifying fine details without creating artifacts. Furthermore, its robust generalization capabilities enable complex semantic-level lighting adjustments in diverse open-world environments through natural language interactions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Few-Shot Class-Incremental Model Attribution Using Learnable Representation From CLIP-ViT Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08148v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, images that distort or fabricate facts using generative models have become a social concern. To cope with continuous evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, model attribution (MA) is necessary beyond just detection of synthetic images. However, current deep learning-based MA methods must be trained from scratch with new data to recognize unseen models, which is time-consuming and data-intensive. This work proposes a new strategy to deal with persistently emerging generative models. We adapt few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) mechanisms for MA problem to uncover novel generative AI models. Unlike existing FSCIL approaches that focus on object classification using high-level information, MA requires analyzing low-level details like color and texture in synthetic images. Thus, we utilize a learnable representation from different levels of CLIP-ViT features. To learn an effective representation, we propose Adaptive Integration Module (AIM) to calculate a weighted sum of CLIP-ViT block features for each image, enhancing the ability to identify generative models. Extensive experiments show our method effectively extends from prior generative models to recent ones.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |
| **[Enhancing Prohibited Item Detection through X-ray-Specific Augmentation and Contextual Feature Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18078v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray prohibited item detection faces challenges due to the long-tail distribution and unique characteristics of X-ray imaging. Traditional data augmentation strategies, such as copy-paste and mixup, are ineffective at improving the detection of rare items due to the complex interactions between overlapping objects. Furthermore, X-ray imaging removes easily distinguishable features like color and texture, making it difficult to differentiate between visually similar categories. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose the X-ray Imaging-driven Detection Network (XIDNet). Inspired by the unique characteristics of X-ray imaging, this network introduces two key innovations: a novel X-ray-specific augmentation strategy that generates more realistic training samples for rare items, thereby improving detection performance for categories with insufficient samples, and an contextual feature integration algorithm that captures the spatial and semantic interactions between objects and surroundings under X-ray imaging, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between similar categories. Extensive experimental results show that XIDNet effectively leverages X-ray imaging characteristics to significantly improve detection performance, outperforming popular SoTA methods by up to 17.2% in tail categories.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Deep Perceptual Enhancement for Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08027v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to numerous hardware shortcomings, medical image acquisition devices are susceptible to producing low-quality (i.e., low contrast, inappropriate brightness, noisy, etc.) images. Regrettably, perceptually degraded images directly impact the diagnosis process and make the decision-making manoeuvre of medical practitioners notably complicated. This study proposes to enhance such low-quality images by incorporating end-to-end learning strategies for accelerating medical image analysis tasks. To the best concern, this is the first work in medical imaging which comprehensively tackles perceptual enhancement, including contrast correction, luminance correction, denoising, etc., with a fully convolutional deep network. The proposed network leverages residual blocks and a residual gating mechanism for diminishing visual artefacts and is guided by a multi-term objective function to perceive the perceptually plausible enhanced images. The practicability of the deep medical image enhancement method has been extensively investigated with sophisticated experiments. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed method could outperform the existing enhancement methods for different medical image modalities by 5.00 to 7.00 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics and 4.00 to 6.00 in DeltaE metrics. Additionally, the proposed method can drastically improve the medical image analysis tasks' performance and reveal the potentiality of such an enhancement method in real-world applications.

| **[Transform-Dependent Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08443v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet conventional attack methods utilize static adversarial perturbations that induce fixed mispredictions. In this work, we exploit an overlooked property of adversarial perturbations--their dependence on image transforms--and introduce transform-dependent adversarial attacks. Unlike traditional attacks, our perturbations exhibit metamorphic properties, enabling diverse adversarial effects as a function of transformation parameters. We demonstrate that this transform-dependent vulnerability exists across different architectures (e.g., CNN and transformer), vision tasks (e.g., image classification and object detection), and a wide range of image transforms. Additionally, we show that transform-dependent perturbations can serve as a defense mechanism, preventing sensitive information disclosure when image enhancement transforms pose a risk of revealing private content. Through analysis in blackbox and defended model settings, we show that transform-dependent perturbations achieve high targeted attack success rates, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer attacks by 17-31% in blackbox scenarios. Our work introduces novel, controllable paradigm for adversarial attack deployment, revealing a previously overlooked vulnerability in deep networks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods lack generalization and are limited to specific tasks such as image recovery. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Gated-Mechanism Mixture-of-Experts (GM-MoE)}, the first framework to introduce a mixture-of-experts network for low-light image enhancement. GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MoE achieves superior generalization with respect to 25 compared approaches, reaching state-of-the-art performance on PSNR on 5 benchmarks and SSIM on 4 benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

The online constraints comprise limited onboard storage capacity and communication bandwidth to the surface, whereas the offline constraints entail the time and effort required for the selection of desired key frames from the video data. An example use case of targeted underwater visual monitoring is finding the most interesting visual frames of fish in a long sequence of an AUV's visual experience. This challenge of targeted informative sampling is further aggravated in murky waters with poor visibility. In this paper, we present MERLION, a novel framework that provides semantically aligned and visually enhanced summaries for murky underwater marine environment monitoring and exploration. Specifically, our framework integrates (a) an image-text model for semantically aligning the visual samples to the users' needs, (b) an image enhancement model for murky water visual data and (c) an informative sampler for summarizing the monitoring experience. We validate our proposed MERLION framework on real-world data with user studies and present qualitative and quantitative results using our evaluation metric and show improved results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

These issues hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous driving.Traditional enhancement techniques, such as multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details and often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images under complex lighting conditions. Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance Network (DLEN), a novel architecture that incorporates two distinct attention mechanisms, considering both spatial and frequency domains. Our model introduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation phase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and texture details. Additionally, we design a dual-branch structure that leverages the power of the Transformer architecture to enhance both the illumination and structural components of the image.Through extensive experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.Code is available here: https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN</p></details> | <details><summary>some ...</summary><p>some technical problems are found and need some improvement</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN) |

This paper presents an adaptive enhancement framework integrating illumination compensation, multi-domain filtering, and dynamic color correction. A hybrid illumination compensation strategy combining CLAHE, Gamma correction, and Retinex enhances visibility. A two-stage filtering process, including spatial-domain (Gaussian, Bilateral, Guided) and frequency-domain (Fourier, Wavelet) methods, effectively reduces noise while preserving details. To correct color distortion, an adaptive color compensation (ACC) model estimates spectral attenuation and water type to combine RCP, DCP, and MUDCP dynamically. Finally, a perceptually guided color balance mechanism ensures natural color restoration. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in contrast enhancement, color correction, and structural preservation, making the framework robust for underwater imaging applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Perceptual Multi-Exposure Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09604v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an ever-increasing demand for high dynamic range (HDR) scene shooting, multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) technology has abounded. In recent years, multi-scale exposure fusion approaches based on detail-enhancement have led the way for improvement in highlight and shadow details. Most of such methods, however, are too computationally expensive to be deployed on mobile devices. This paper presents a perceptual multi-exposure fusion method that not just ensures fine shadow/highlight details but with lower complexity than detailenhanced methods. We analyze the potential defects of three classical exposure measures in lieu of using detail-enhancement component and improve two of them, namely adaptive Wellexposedness (AWE) and the gradient of color images (3-D gradient). AWE designed in YCbCr color space considers the difference between varying exposure images. 3-D gradient is employed to extract fine details. We build a large-scale multiexposure benchmark dataset suitable for static scenes, which contains 167 image sequences all told. Experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed method exceeds existing eight state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visually and MEF-SSIM value. Moreover, our approach can achieve a better improvement for current image enhancement techniques, ensuring fine detail in bright light.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Night-Voyager: Consistent and Efficient Nocturnal Vision-Aided State Estimation in Object Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20054v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous robotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ERetinex: Event Camera Meets Retinex Theory for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02484v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light image enhancement aims to restore the under-exposure image captured in dark scenarios. Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Wavelet-Enhanced Desnowing: A Novel Single Image Restoration Approach for Traffic Surveillance under Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01339v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration under adverse weather conditions refers to the process of removing degradation caused by weather particles while improving visual quality. Most existing deweathering methods rely on increasing the network scale and data volume to achieve better performance which requires more expensive computing power. Also, many methods lack generalization for specific applications. In the traffic surveillance screener, the main challenges are snow removal and veil effect elimination. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-enhanced snow removal method that use a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform feature enhancement module and a dynamic convolution acceleration module to address snow degradation in surveillance images. We also use a residual learning restoration module to remove veil effects caused by rain, snow, and fog. The proposed architecture extracts and analyzes information from snow-covered regions, significantly improving snow removal performance. And the residual learning restoration module removes veiling effects in images, enhancing clarity and detail. Experiments show that it performs better than some popular desnowing methods. Our approach also demonstrates effectiveness and accuracy when applied to real traffic surveillance images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-supervision via Controlled Transformation and Unpaired Self-conditioning for Low-light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00642v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world low-light images captured by imaging devices suffer from poor visibility and require a domain-specific enhancement to produce artifact-free outputs that reveal details. In this paper, we propose an unpaired low-light image enhancement network leveraging novel controlled transformation-based self-supervision and unpaired self-conditioning strategies. The model determines the required degrees of enhancement at the input image pixels, which are learned from the unpaired low-lit and well-lit images without any direct supervision. The self-supervision is based on a controlled transformation of the input image and subsequent maintenance of its enhancement in spite of the transformation. The self-conditioning performs training of the model on unpaired images such that it does not enhance an already-enhanced image or a well-lit input image. The inherent noise in the input low-light images is handled by employing low gradient magnitude suppression in a detail-preserving manner. In addition, our noise handling is self-conditioned by preventing the denoising of noise-free well-lit images. The training based on low-light image enhancement-specific attributes allows our model to avoid paired supervision without compromising significantly in performance. While our proposed self-supervision aids consistent enhancement, our novel self-conditioning facilitates adequate enhancement. Extensive experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that our model, in general, outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and subjectively. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of our self-supervision and self-conditioning strategies, and the related loss functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2024 IEEE.

| **[Flow Matching for Medical Image Synthesis: Bridging the Gap Between Speed and Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00266v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for various medical applications. However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications.

However, recent research on utilizing event data has primarily focused on low-light image enhancement, neglecting image enhancement and brightness adjustment across a broader range of lighting conditions, such as normal or high illumination. Based on this, we propose a novel research question: how to employ events to enhance and adaptively adjust the brightness of images captured under broad lighting conditions? To investigate this question, we first collected a new dataset, SEE-600K, consisting of 610,126 images and corresponding events across 202 scenarios, each featuring an average of four lighting conditions with over a 1000-fold variation in illumination. Subsequently, we propose a framework that effectively utilizes events to smoothly adjust image brightness through the use of prompts. Our framework captures color through sensor patterns, uses cross-attention to model events as a brightness dictionary, and adjusts the image's dynamic range to form a broad light-range representation (BLR), which is then decoded at the pixel level based on the brightness prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only performs well on the low-light enhancement dataset but also shows robust performance on broader light-range image enhancement using the SEE-600K dataset. Additionally, our approach enables pixel-level brightness adjustment, providing flexibility for post-processing and inspiring more imaging applications.

Many existing LLIE methods are based on standard RGB (sRGB) space, which often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due to inherent high color sensitivity in sRGB. While converting the images using Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) color space helps resolve the brightness issue, it introduces significant red and black noise artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a new color space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by polarized HS maps and learnable intensity. The former enforces small distances for red coordinates to remove the red artifacts, while the latter compresses the low-light regions to remove the black artifacts. To fully leverage the chromatic and intensity information, a novel Color and Intensity Decoupling Network (CIDNet) is further introduced to learn accurate photometric mapping function under different lighting conditions in the HVI space. Comprehensive results from benchmark and ablation experiments show that the proposed HVI color space with CIDNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

| **[Striving for Faster and Better: A One-Layer Architecture with Auto Re-parameterization for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19867v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based low-light image enhancers have made significant progress in recent years, with a trend towards achieving satisfactory visual quality while gradually reducing the number of parameters and improving computational efficiency. In this work, we aim to delving into the limits of image enhancers both from visual quality and computational efficiency, while striving for both better performance and faster processing. To be concrete, by rethinking the task demands, we build an explicit connection, i.e., visual quality and computational efficiency are corresponding to model learning and structure design, respectively. Around this connection, we enlarge parameter space by introducing the re-parameterization for ample model learning of a pre-defined minimalist network (e.g., just one layer), to avoid falling into a local solution. To strengthen the structural representation, we define a hierarchical search scheme for discovering a task-oriented re-parameterized structure, which also provides powerful support for efficiency. Ultimately, this achieves efficient low-light image enhancement using only a single convolutional layer, while maintaining excellent visual quality. Experimental results show our sensible superiority both in quality and efficiency against recently-proposed methods. Especially, our running time on various platforms (e.g., CPU, GPU, NPU, DSP) consistently moves beyond the existing fastest scheme.

However, low illumination and uneven brightness in underground environments significantly degrade image quality, posing challenges for enhancement methods that often rely on difficult-to-obtain paired reference images. Additionally, there is a trade-off between enhancement performance and computational efficiency on edge devices within IoVT systems.To address these issues, we propose a multimodal image enhancement method tailored for coal mine IoVT, utilizing an ISP-CNN fusion architecture optimized for uneven illumination. This two-stage strategy combines global enhancement with detail optimization, effectively improving image quality, especially in poorly lit areas. A CLIP-based multimodal iterative optimization allows for unsupervised training of the enhancement algorithm. By integrating traditional image signal processing (ISP) with convolutional neural networks (CNN), our approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining high performance, making it suitable for real-time deployment on edge devices.Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates uneven brightness and enhances key image quality metrics, with PSNR improvements of 2.9%-4.9%, SSIM by 4.3%-11.4%, and VIF by 4.9%-17.8% compared to seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Simulated coal mine monitoring scenarios validate our method's ability to balance performance and computational demands, facilitating real-time enhancement and supporting safer mining operations.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed method combines logarithmic image processing models in a PDE formulation refined with linear filter-based operators in either spatial or frequency domain. Additionally, a fast, simplified de-hazing function approximation of the hazy image formation model is developed in combination with fuzzy homomorphic refinement. The proposed algorithm solves the problem of image darkening and over-enhancement of edges in addition to enhancement of dark image regions encountered in previous formulations. This is in addition to avoiding enhancement of sky regions in de-hazed images while avoiding halo effect. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is utilized for underwater and dust storm image enhancement with the incorporation of a modified global contrast enhancement algorithm.

This study introduces an optimized hybrid approach that combines the Perona-Malik Diffusion (PMD) filter with contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to enhance Pap smear image quality. The PMD filter reduces the image noise, whereas CLAHE improves the image contrast. The hybrid method was optimized using spider monkey optimization (SMO PMD-CLAHE). BRISQUE and CEIQ are the new objective functions for the PMD filter and CLAHE optimization, respectively. The simulations were conducted using the SIPaKMeD dataset. The results indicate that SMO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in optimizing the PMD filter and CLAHE. The proposed method achieved an average effective measure of enhancement (EME) of 5.45, root mean square (RMS) contrast of 60.45, Michelson's contrast (MC) of 0.995, and entropy of 6.80.

A comprehensive evaluation benchmark for fundus image enhancement is indispensable for three main reasons: 1) The existing denoising metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) are hardly to extend to downstream real-world clinical research (e.g., Vessel morphology consistency). 2) There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation for both paired and unpaired enhancement methods, along with the need for expert protocols to accurately assess clinical value. 3) An ideal evaluation system should provide insights to inform future developments of fundus image enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel comprehensive benchmark, EyeBench, to provide insights that align enhancement models with clinical needs, offering a foundation for future work to improve the clinical relevance and applicability of generative models for fundus image enhancement. EyeBench has three appealing properties: 1) multi-dimensional clinical alignment downstream evaluation: In addition to evaluating the enhancement task, we provide several clinically significant downstream tasks for fundus images, including vessel segmentation, DR grading, denoising generalization, and lesion segmentation. 2) Medical expert-guided evaluation design: We introduce a novel dataset that promote comprehensive and fair comparisons between paired and unpaired methods and includes a manual evaluation protocol by medical experts. 3) Valuable insights: Our benchmark study provides a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of existing methods across different downstream tasks, assisting medical experts in making informed choices. Additionally, we offer further analysis of the challenges faced by existing methods.

We propose IRSRMamba, a novel framework integrating wavelet transform feature modulation for multi-scale adaptation and an SSMs-based semantic consistency loss to restore fragmented contextual information. This design enhances global-local feature fusion, structural coherence, and fine-detail preservation while mitigating block-induced artifacts.

Meanwhile, existing unsupervised methods lack effective bridging capabilities for unknown degradation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-reference lighting estimation diffusion model for low-light image enhancement called Zero-LED. It utilizes the stable convergence ability of diffusion models to bridge the gap between low-light domains and real normal-light domains and successfully alleviates the dependence on pairwise training data via zero-reference learning. Specifically, we first design the initial optimization network to preprocess the input image and implement bidirectional constraints between the diffusion model and the initial optimization network through multiple objective functions. Subsequently, the degradation factors of the real-world scene are optimized iteratively to achieve effective light enhancement. In addition, we explore a frequency-domain based and semantically guided appearance reconstruction module that encourages feature alignment of the recovered image at a fine-grained level and satisfies subjective expectations. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach to other state-of-the-art methods and more significant generalization capabilities. We will open the source code upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing singular modality image enhancement methods struggle to restore image regions lacking valid information. By leveraging light-impervious infrared images, visible and infrared image fusion methods have the potential to reveal information hidden in darkness. However, they primarily emphasize inter-modal complementation but neglect intra-modal enhancement, limiting the perceptual quality of output images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, dubbed visible and infrared information synthesis (VIIS), which aims to achieve both information enhancement and fusion of the two modalities. Given the difficulty in obtaining ground truth in the VIIS task, we design an information synthesis pretext task (ISPT) based on image augmentation. We employ a diffusion model as the framework and design a sparse attention-based dual-modalities residual (SADMR) conditioning mechanism to enhance information interaction between the two modalities. This mechanism enables features with prior knowledge from both modalities to adaptively and iteratively attend to each modality's information during the denoising process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms not only the state-of-the-art methods in relevant fields but also the newly designed baselines capable of both information enhancement and fusion.

These uses include advertising campaigns, educational resources, and social networking platforms. There is an increasing need for high-quality graphic information as people become more visually focused. However, captured images frequently have poor visibility and a high amount of noise due to the limitations of image-capturing devices and lighting conditions. Improving the visual quality of images taken in low illumination is the aim of low-illumination image enhancement. This problem is addressed by traditional image enhancement techniques, which alter noise, brightness, and contrast. Deep learning-based methods, however, have dominated recently made advances in this area. These methods have effectively reduced noise while preserving important information, showing promising results in the improvement of low-illumination images. An extensive summary of image signal processing methods for enhancing low-illumination images is provided in this paper. Three categories are classified in the review for approaches: hybrid techniques, deep learning-based methods, and traditional approaches. Conventional techniques include denoising, automated white balancing, and noise reduction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in deep learningbased techniques to recognize and extract characteristics from low-light images. To get better results, hybrid approaches combine deep learning-based methodologies with more conventional methods.

While this concept is well-established in Natural Language Inference, it remains unexplored in visual entailment. At a high level, DVE enables models to refine their initial interpretations, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in various applications such as detecting misleading information in images, enhancing visual question answering, and refining decision-making processes in autonomous systems. Existing metrics do not adequately capture the change in the entailment relationship brought by updates. To address this, we propose a novel inference-aware evaluator designed to capture changes in entailment strength induced by updates, using pairwise contrastive learning and categorical information learning. Additionally, we introduce a reward-driven update optimization method to further enhance the quality of updates generated by multimodal models.

Increased extreme weather events associated with climate change can result in alterations to river and stream connectivity. While traditional stream flow gauges are costly to deploy and limited to large river bodies, trail camera methods are a low-cost and easily deployed alternative to collect hourly data. Image capturing, however requires stream ecologists to manually curate (select and label) tens of thousands of images per year. To improve this workflow, we developed an automated instream trail camera image classification system consisting of three parts: (1) image processing, (2) image augmentation and (3) machine learning. The image preprocessing consists of seven image quality filters, foliage-based luma variance reduction, resizing and bottom-center cropping. Images are balanced using variable amount of generative augmentation using diffusion models and then passed to a machine learning classification model in labeled form. By using the vision transformer architecture and temporal image enhancement in our framework, we are able to increase the 75% base accuracy to 90% for a new unseen site image. We make use of a dataset captured and labeled by staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection between 2018-2020. Our results indicate that a combination of temporal image processing and attention-based models are effective at classifying unseen river connectivity images.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures | None |

GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text-to-Image Generation for Vocabulary Learning Using the Keyword Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17099v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 'keyword method' is an effective technique for learning vocabulary of a foreign language. It involves creating a memorable visual link between what a word means and what its pronunciation in a foreign language sounds like in the learner's native language. However, these memorable visual links remain implicit in the people's mind and are not easy to remember for a large set of words. To enhance the memorisation and recall of the vocabulary, we developed an application that combines the keyword method with text-to-image generators to externalise the memorable visual links into visuals. These visuals represent additional stimuli during the memorisation process. To explore the effectiveness of this approach we first run a pilot study to investigate how difficult it is to externalise the descriptions of mental visualisations of memorable links, by asking participants to write them down. We used these descriptions as prompts for text-to-image generator (DALL-E2) to convert them into images and asked participants to select their favourites. Next, we compared different text-to-image generators (DALL-E2, Midjourney, Stable and Latent Diffusion) to evaluate the perceived quality of the generated images by each. Despite heterogeneous results, participants mostly preferred images generated by DALL-E2, which was used also for the final study. In this study, we investigated whether providing such images enhances the retention of vocabulary being learned, compared to the keyword method only. Our results indicate that people did not encounter difficulties describing their visualisations of memorable links and that providing corresponding images significantly improves memory retention.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Directing Mamba to Complex Textures: An Efficient Texture-Aware State Space Model for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16583v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to recover details and enhance contrast in degraded images. With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |
| **[PEP-GS: Perceptually-Enhanced Precise Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05731v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved significant success in real-time, high-quality 3D scene rendering. However, it faces several challenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture view-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and specular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for color representation often struggle to effectively capture specular highlights and anisotropic components, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex lighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color saturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a perceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes, including opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical harmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which enables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects and specular highlights. By employing a stable and interpretable framework for opacity and covariance estimation, PEP-GS avoids the removal of essential Gaussians prematurely, ensuring a more accurate scene representation. Furthermore, perceptual optimization is applied to the final rendered images, enhancing perceptual consistency across different views and ensuring high-quality renderings with improved texture fidelity and fine-scale detail preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that PEP-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving view-dependent effects, specular reflections, and fine-scale details.</p></details> |  | None |

A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

Early research in this area was primarily based on horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs), but as more diverse RS datasets have become available, tasks involving oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) and segmentation masks have emerged. In practical applications, different targets require different grounding types: HBB can localize an object's position, OBB provides its orientation, and mask depicts its shape. However, existing specialized methods are typically tailored to a single type of RS visual grounding task and are hard to generalize across tasks. In contrast, large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit powerful multi-task learning capabilities but struggle to handle dense prediction tasks like segmentation. This paper proposes GeoGround, a novel framework that unifies support for HBB, OBB, and mask RS visual grounding tasks, allowing flexible output selection. Rather than customizing the architecture of VLM, our work aims to elegantly support pixel-level visual grounding output through the Text-Mask technique. We define prompt-assisted and geometry-guided learning to enhance consistency across different signals. To support model training, we present refGeo, a large-scale RS visual instruction-following dataset containing 161k image-text pairs. Experimental results show that GeoGround demonstrates strong performance across four RS visual grounding tasks, matching or surpassing the performance of specialized methods on multiple benchmarks.

The optical system's point spread function (PSF) and common CLSM image degradation mechanisms namely photon shot noise, dark current noise, motion blur, speckle noise, and undersampling were modeled and were directly included into model architecture. The model reconstructs high fidelity images from heavily noisy inputs by using convolutional and transposed convolutional layers. Following the advances in compressed sensing, our approach significantly reduces data acquisition requirements without compromising image resolution. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on simulated CLSM images of diverse structures, including lipid droplets, neuronal networks, and fibrillar systems. Comparisons with traditional deconvolution algorithms such as Richardson-Lucy (RL), non-negative least squares (NNLS), and other methods like Total Variation (TV) regularization, Wiener filtering, and Wavelet denoising demonstrate the superiority of the network in restoring fine structural details with high fidelity. Assessment metrics like Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), underlines that the AdaptivePhysicsAutoencoder achieved robust image enhancement across diverse CLSM conditions, helping faster acquisition, reduced photodamage, and reliable performance in low light and sparse sampling scenarios holding promise for applications in live cell imaging, dynamic biological studies, and high throughput material characterization.</p></details> |  | None |

Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> | None |
| **[Quality Enhancement of Radiographic X-ray Images by Interpretable Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12245v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray imaging is the most widely used medical imaging modality. However, in the common practice, inconsistency in the initial presentation of X-ray images is a common complaint by radiologists. Different patient positions, patient habitus and scanning protocols can lead to differences in image presentations, e.g., differences in brightness and contrast globally or regionally. To compensate for this, additional work will be executed by clinical experts to adjust the images to the desired presentation, which can be time-consuming. Existing deep-learning-based end-to-end solutions can automatically correct images with promising performances. Nevertheless, these methods are hard to be interpreted and difficult to be understood by clinical experts. In this manuscript, a novel interpretable mapping method by deep learning is proposed, which automatically enhances the image brightness and contrast globally and locally. Meanwhile, because the model is inspired by the workflow of the brightness and contrast manipulation, it can provide interpretable pixel maps for explaining the motivation of image enhancement. The experiment on the clinical datasets show the proposed method can provide consistent brightness and contrast correction on X-ray images with accuracy of 24.75 dB PSNR and 0.8431 SSIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE ...</summary><p>SPIE Medical Imaging 2025</p></details> | None |

The problem of enhancing images captured during night or in dark environments has been well-studied in the image signal processing literature. However, current deep learning-based solutions struggle with efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios (e.g. scenes with noise, saturated pixels, bad illumination). We propose a lightweight neural network that combines image processing in the frequency and spatial domains.

| **[When No-Reference Image Quality Models Meet MAP Estimation in Diffusion Latents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06406v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) models can effectively quantify perceived image quality, often achieving strong correlations with human perceptual scores on standard IQA benchmarks. Yet, limited efforts have been devoted to treating NR-IQA models as natural image priors for real-world image enhancement, and consequently comparing them from a perceptual optimization standpoint. In this work, we show -- for the first time -- that NR-IQA models can be plugged into the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework for image enhancement. This is achieved by performing gradient ascent in the diffusion latent space rather than in the raw pixel domain, leveraging a pretrained differentiable and bijective diffusion process. Likely, different NR-IQA models lead to different enhanced outputs, which in turn provides a new computational means of comparing them. Unlike conventional correlation-based measures, our comparison method offers complementary insights into the respective strengths and weaknesses of the competing NR-IQA models in perceptual optimization scenarios. Additionally, we aim to improve the best-performing NR-IQA model in diffusion latent MAP estimation by incorporating the advantages of other top-performing methods. The resulting model delivers noticeably better results in enhancing real-world images afflicted by unknown and complex distortions, all preserving a high degree of image fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

Rapid and accurate flood detection and monitoring are crucial for mitigating these impacts. This study compares the performance of three deep learning models UNet, ResNet, and DeepLabv3 for pixelwise water segmentation to aid in flood detection, utilizing images from drones, in field observations, and social media. This study involves creating a new dataset that augments wellknown benchmark datasets with flood-specific images, enhancing the robustness of the models. The UNet, ResNet, and DeepLab v3 architectures are tested to determine their effectiveness in various environmental conditions and geographical locations, and the strengths and limitations of each model are also discussed here, providing insights into their applicability in different scenarios by predicting image segmentation masks. This fully automated approach allows these models to isolate flooded areas in images, significantly reducing processing time compared to traditional semi-automated methods. The outcome of this study is to predict segmented masks for each image effected by a flood disaster and the validation accuracy of these models. This methodology facilitates timely and continuous flood monitoring, providing vital data for emergency response teams to reduce loss of life and economic damages. It offers a significant reduction in the time required to generate flood maps, cutting down the manual processing time. Additionally, we present avenues for future research, including the integration of multimodal data sources and the development of robust deep learning architectures tailored specifically for flood detection tasks.

The mamba-based low-light enhancer, equipped with an illumination estimator and a damage restorer, achieves global image enhancement while preserving the details and structure of low-light images. Additionally, we advance a cross-modal mamba network to achieve efficient interactive learning between vision and language modalities.

However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance.

Mainstream LLIE methods typically learn an end-to-end mapping based on pairs of low-light and normal-light images. However, normal-light images under varying illumination conditions serve as reference images, making it difficult to define a ``perfect'' reference image This leads to the challenge of reconciling metric-oriented and visual-friendly results. Recently, many cross-modal studies have found that side information from other related modalities can guide visual representation learning. Based on this, we introduce a Natural Language Supervision (NLS) strategy, which learns feature maps from text corresponding to images, offering a general and flexible interface for describing an image under different illumination. However, image distributions conditioned on textual descriptions are highly multimodal, which makes training difficult. To address this issue, we design a Textual Guidance Conditioning Mechanism (TCM) that incorporates the connections between image regions and sentence words, enhancing the ability to capture fine-grained cross-modal cues for images and text. This strategy not only utilizes a wider range of supervised sources, but also provides a new paradigm for LLIE based on visual and textual feature alignment. In order to effectively identify and merge features from various levels of image and textual information, we design an Information Fusion Attention (IFA) module to enhance different regions at different levels. We integrate the proposed TCM and IFA into a Natural Language Supervision network for LLIE, named NaLSuper. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and superior effectiveness of our proposed NaLSuper.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, addressing extreme exposure variations in images remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and contrast inconsistencies across regions. Current methods often struggle to adapt effectively to these variations, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose HipyrNet, a novel approach that integrates a HyperNetwork within a Laplacian Pyramid-based framework to tackle the challenges of mixed-exposure image enhancement. The inclusion of a HyperNetwork allows the model to adapt to these exposure variations. HyperNetworks dynamically generates weights for another network, allowing dynamic changes during deployment. In our model, the HyperNetwork employed is used to predict optimal kernels for Feature Pyramid decomposition, which enables a tailored and adaptive decomposition process for each input image. Our enhanced translational network incorporates multiscale decomposition and reconstruction, leveraging dynamic kernel prediction to capture and manipulate features across varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HipyrNet outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios with extreme exposure variations, achieving superior results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our approach sets a new benchmark for mixed-exposure image enhancement, paving the way for future research in adaptive image translation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing 3D-RES approaches face two major challenges: feature ambiguity and intent ambiguity. Feature ambiguity arises from information loss or distortion during point cloud acquisition due to limitations such as lighting and viewpoint. Intent ambiguity refers to the model's equal treatment of all queries during the decoding process, lacking top-down task-specific guidance. In this paper, we introduce an Image enhanced Prompt Decoding Network (IPDN), which leverages multi-view images and task-driven information to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. To address feature ambiguity, we propose the Multi-view Semantic Embedding (MSE) module, which injects multi-view 2D image information into the 3D scene and compensates for potential spatial information loss. To tackle intent ambiguity, we designed a Prompt-Aware Decoder (PAD) that guides the decoding process by deriving task-driven signals from the interaction between the expression and visual features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IPDN outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 1.9 and 4.2 points in mIoU metrics on the 3D-RES and 3D-GRES tasks, respectively.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |

| **[Adaptive deep learning framework for robust unsupervised underwater image enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08983v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges in deep learning-based underwater image enhancement is the limited availability of high-quality training data. Underwater images are difficult to capture and are often of poor quality due to the distortion and loss of colour and contrast in water. This makes it difficult to train supervised deep learning models on large and diverse datasets, which can limit the model's performance. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to supervised underwater image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised underwater image enhancement framework that employs a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to train a deep learning model with probabilistic adaptive instance normalization (PAdaIN) and statistically guided multi-colour space stretch that produces realistic underwater images. The resulting framework is composed of a U-Net as a feature extractor and a PAdaIN to encode the uncertainty, which we call UDnet. To improve the visual quality of the images generated by UDnet, we use a statistically guided multi-colour space stretch module that ensures visual consistency with the input image and provides an alternative to training using a ground truth image. The proposed model does not need manual human annotation and can learn with a limited amount of data and achieves state-of-the-art results on underwater images. We evaluated our proposed framework on eight publicly-available datasets. The results show that our proposed framework yields competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches in quantitative as well as qualitative metrics.

However, existing task-driven IQE models tend to overlook an underlying fact -- different levels of vision tasks have varying and sometimes conflicting requirements of image features. To address this problem, this paper proposes a generalized gradient promotion (GradProm) training strategy for task-driven IQE of medical images. Specifically, we partition a task-driven IQE system into two sub-models, i.e., a mainstream model for image enhancement and an auxiliary model for visual recognition. During training, GradProm updates only parameters of the image enhancement model using gradients of the visual recognition model and the image enhancement model, but only when gradients of these two sub-models are aligned in the same direction, which is measured by their cosine similarity. In case gradients of these two sub-models are not in the same direction, GradProm only uses the gradient of the image enhancement model to update its parameters. Theoretically, we have proved that the optimization direction of the image enhancement model will not be biased by the auxiliary visual recognition model under the implementation of GradProm. Empirically, extensive experimental results on four public yet challenging medical image datasets demonstrated the superior performance of GradProm over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> | None |

Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work.

Many deep learning-based methods have been developed to address this issue and have shown promising results in recent years. However, single-stage methods, which attempt to unify the complex mapping across both domains, leading to limited denoising performance. In contrast, two-stage approaches typically decompose a raw image with color filter arrays (CFA) into a four-channel RGGB format before feeding it into a neural network. However, this strategy overlooks the critical role of demosaicing within the Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, leading to color distortions under varying lighting conditions, especially in low-light scenarios. To address these issues, we design a novel Mamba scanning mechanism, called RAWMamba, to effectively handle raw images with different CFAs. Furthermore, we present a Retinex Decomposition Module (RDM) grounded in Retinex prior, which decouples illumination from reflectance to facilitate more effective denoising and automatic non-linear exposure correction. By bridging demosaicing and denoising, better raw image enhancement is achieved. Experimental evaluations conducted on public datasets SID and MCR demonstrate that our proposed RAWMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain mapping.</p></details> |  | None |

Towards this issue, we propose a Dual degrAdation-inSpired deep Unfolding network, termed DASUNet, for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, we construct a dual degradation model (DDM) to explicitly simulate the deterioration mechanism of low-light images. It learns two distinct image priors via considering degradation specificity between luminance and chrominance spaces. To make the proposed scheme tractable, we design an alternating optimization solution to solve the proposed DDM. Further, the designed solution is unfolded into a specified deep network, imitating the iteration updating rules, to form DASUNet. Based on different specificity in two spaces, we design two customized Transformer block to model different priors. Additionally, a space aggregation module (SAM) is presented to boost the interaction of two degradation models. Extensive experiments on multiple popular low-light image datasets validate the effectiveness of DASUNet compared to canonical state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement methods. Our source code and pretrained model will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Furthermore, the quest for generating enhancements that are visually realistic and attractive remains an underexplored realm. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel \textbf{LLIE} framework with the guidance of \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GPP-LLIE}) derived from vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we first propose a pipeline that guides VLMs to assess multiple visual attributes of the LL image and quantify the assessment to output the global and local perceptual priors. Subsequently, to incorporate these generative perceptual priors to benefit LLIE, we introduce a transformer-based backbone in the diffusion process, and develop a new layer normalization (\textit{\textbf{GPP-LN}}) and an attention mechanism (\textit{\textbf{LPP-Attn}}) guided by global and local perceptual priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms current SOTA methods on paired LL datasets and exhibits superior generalization on real-world data.

However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> | None |

Our framework employs differentiable preprocessing filters to perform image enhancement suitable for later-stage object detections. Our framework introduces two differentiable filters: a B\'ezier curve-based pixel-wise (BPW) filter and a kernel-based local (KBL) filter. These filters unify the functions of classical image processing filters and improve performance of object detection. We also propose a domain-agnostic data augmentation strategy using the BPW filter. Our method does not require data-specific customization of the filter combinations, parameter ranges, and data augmentation. We evaluate our proposed approach, called Enhanced Robustness by Unified Image Processing (ERUP)-YOLO, by applying it to the YOLOv3 detector. Experiments on adverse weather datasets demonstrate that our proposed filters match or exceed the expressiveness of conventional methods and our ERUP-YOLO achieved superior performance in a wide range of adverse weather conditions, including fog and low-light conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

This paper brings the MAE-like framework to nighttime image enhancement, demonstrating that severe augmentation during training produces strong network priors that are resilient to real-world night haze degradations. We propose a novel nighttime image dehazing method with self-prior learning. Our main novelty lies in the design of severe augmentation, which allows our model to learn robust priors. Unlike MAE that uses masking, we leverage two key challenging factors of nighttime images as augmentation: light effects and noise. During training, we intentionally degrade clear images by blending them with light effects as well as by adding noise, and subsequently restore the clear images. This enables our model to learn clear background priors. By increasing the noise values to approach as high as the pixel intensity values of the glow and light effect blended images, our augmentation becomes severe, resulting in stronger priors. While our self-prior learning is considerably effective in suppressing glow and revealing details of background scenes, in some cases, there are still some undesired artifacts that remain, particularly in the forms of over-suppression. To address these artifacts, we propose a self-refinement module based on the semi-supervised teacher-student framework. Our NightHaze, especially our MAE-like self-prior learning, shows that models trained with severe augmentation effectively improve the visibility of input haze images, approaching the clarity of clear nighttime images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our NightHaze achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing nighttime image dehazing methods by a substantial margin of 15.5% for MUSIQ and 23.5% for ClipIQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

Existing LLIE methods often fail to discover the underlying relationships between different sub-components, causing the loss of complementary information between multiple modules and network layers, ultimately resulting in the loss of image details. To beat this shortage, we design a hierarchical mutual Enhancement via a Cross Attention transformer (ECAFormer), which introduces an architecture that enables concurrent propagation and interaction of multiple features. The model preserves detailed information by introducing a Dual Multi-head self-attention (DMSA), which leverages visual and semantic features across different scales, allowing them to guide and complement each other. Besides, a Cross-Scale DMSA block is introduced to capture the residual connection, integrating cross-layer information to further enhance image detail. Experimental results show that ECAFormer reaches competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, yielding nearly a 3% improvement in PSNR over the suboptimal method, demonstrating the effectiveness of information interaction in LLIE.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advancements primarily focus on customizing complex neural network models, we have observed significant redundancy in these models, limiting further performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate and rethink the model redundancy for LLIE, identifying parameter harmfulness and parameter uselessness. Inspired by the rethinking, we propose two innovative techniques to mitigate model redundancy while improving the LLIE performance: Attention Dynamic Reallocation (ADR) and Parameter Orthogonal Generation (POG). ADR dynamically reallocates appropriate attention based on original attention, thereby mitigating parameter harmfulness. POG learns orthogonal basis embeddings of parameters and prevents degradation to static parameters, thereby mitigating parameter uselessness. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our techniques.

These innovations enable CPGA-Net+ to achieve superior performance on image enhancement tasks for supervised and unsupervised learning, surpassing lightweight state-of-the-art methods with high efficiency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that our approach inherently decomposes the enhancement process into restoration and lightening stages, aligning with the fundamental image degradation model. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a block simplification technique that reduces computational costs by more than two-thirds.

Monitoring the distribution and abundance of seagrass is essential for environmental impact assessments and conservation efforts. However, the current manual methods of analyzing underwater video transects to assess seagrass coverage are time-consuming and subjective. This work explores the use of deep learning models to automate the process of seagrass detection and coverage estimation from underwater video data. A dataset of over 8,300 annotated underwater images was created, and several deep learning architectures, including ResNet, InceptionNetV3, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer, were evaluated for the task of binary classification of ``Eelgrass Present'' and ``Eelgrass Absent'' images. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly the Vision Transformer, can achieve high performance in predicting eelgrass presence, with AUROC scores exceeding 0.95 on the final test dataset. The use of transfer learning and the application of the Deep WaveNet underwater image enhancement model further improved the models' capabilities. The proposed methodology allows for the efficient processing of large volumes of video data, enabling the acquisition of much more detailed information on seagrass distributions compared to current manual methods. This information is crucial for environmental impact assessments and monitoring programs, as seagrasses are important indicators of coastal ecosystem health. Overall, this project demonstrates the value that deep learning can bring to the field of marine ecology and environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |

While distortion-based protection mechanisms are commonly employed to mitigate this issue, they often lead to notable performance degradation. Existing methods struggle to preserve model performance while ensuring privacy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation-based framework designed to achieve a favorable privacy-utility trade-off, with the potential to enhance model performance in certain cases. Our framework incorporates the AugMix algorithm at the client level, enabling data augmentation with controllable severity. By integrating the Jensen-Shannon divergence into the loss function, we embed the distortion introduced by AugMix into the model gradients, effectively safeguarding privacy against deep leakage attacks. Moreover, the JS divergence promotes model consistency across different augmentations of the same image, enhancing both robustness and performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method in protecting privacy. Furthermore, our approach maintains, and in some cases improves, model performance, showcasing its ability to achieve a robust privacy-utility trade-off.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce JUDE, a Deep Joint Unrolling for Deblurring and Low-Light Image Enhancement, inspired by the image physical model. Based on Retinex theory and the blurring model, the low-light blurry input is iteratively deblurred and decomposed, producing sharp low-light reflectance and illuminance through an unrolling mechanism. Additionally, we incorporate various modules to estimate the initial blur kernel, enhance brightness, and eliminate noise in the final image.

However, previous approaches often struggle due to limitations in training data or reliance on additional prompts, leading to inharmonious and content-disrupted output. To surmount these hurdles, we design a Training-and-prompt-Free General Painterly Harmonization method (TF-GPH). TF-GPH incorporates a novel ``Similarity Disentangle Mask'', which disentangles the foreground content and background image by redirecting their attention to corresponding reference images, enhancing the attention mechanism for multi-image inputs. Additionally, we propose a ``Similarity Reweighting'' mechanism to balance harmonization between stylization and content preservation. This mechanism minimizes content disruption by prioritizing the content-similar features within the given background style reference. Finally, we address the deficiencies in existing benchmarks by proposing novel range-based evaluation metrics and a new benchmark to better reflect real-world applications.

Existing methods have limited effectiveness in improving essential computer vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and often focus on only one specific condition, such as removing rain or translating nighttime images into daytime ones. To address these limitations, we propose a method to improve the visual quality and clarity degraded by such adverse conditions. Our method, AllWeather-Net, utilizes a novel hierarchical architecture to enhance images across all adverse conditions. This architecture incorporates information at three semantic levels: scene, object, and texture, by discriminating patches at each level. Furthermore, we introduce a Scaled Illumination-aware Attention Mechanism (SIAM) that guides the learning towards road elements critical for autonomous driving perception. SIAM exhibits robustness, remaining unaffected by changes in weather conditions or environmental scenes. AllWeather-Net effectively transforms images into normal weather and daytime scenes, demonstrating superior image enhancement results and subsequently enhancing the performance of semantic segmentation, with up to a 5.3% improvement in mIoU in the trained domain.

For underwater image enhancement, data-driven approaches (e.g., deep neural networks) typically demand extensive datasets, yet acquiring paired clean and degraded underwater images poses significant challenges. Existing datasets have limited contributions to image enhancement due to lack of physics models, publicity, and ground-truth images. PHISWID addresses these issues by offering a set of paired ground-truth (atmospheric) and underwater images synthetically degraded by color degradation and marine snow artifacts. Generating underwater images from atmospheric RGB-D images based on physical models provides pairs of real-world ground-truth and degraded images. Our synthetic approach generates a large quantity of the pairs, enabling effective training of deep neural networks and objective image quality assessment.

Since low-light data is limited and difficult to annotate, we focus on image processing to enhance low-light images and improve the performance of any downstream task model, instead of fine-tuning each of the models which can be prohibitively expensive. We propose to improve the existing zero-reference low-light enhancement by leveraging the CLIP model to capture image prior and for semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a data augmentation strategy to learn an image prior via prompt learning, based on image sampling, to learn the image prior without any need for paired or unpaired normal-light data. Next, we propose a semantic guidance strategy that maximally takes advantage of existing low-light annotation by introducing both content and context cues about the image training patches. We experimentally show, in a qualitative study, that the proposed prior and semantic guidance help to improve the overall image contrast and hue, as well as improve background-foreground discrimination, resulting in reduced over-saturation and noise over-amplification, common in related zero-reference methods. As we target machine cognition, rather than rely on assuming the correlation between human perception and downstream task performance, we conduct and present an ablation study and comparison with related zero-reference methods in terms of task-based performance across many low-light datasets, including image classification, object and face detection, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> | None |

Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality.

Therefore, how to obtain clear and visually pleasant images has become a common concern of people, and the task of underwater image enhancement (UIE) has also emerged as the times require. Among existing UIE methods, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based methods perform well in visual aesthetics, while the physical model-based methods have better scene adaptability. Inheriting the advantages of the above two types of models, we propose a physical model-guided GAN model for UIE in this paper, referred to as PUGAN. The entire network is under the GAN architecture. On the one hand, we design a Parameters Estimation subnetwork (Par-subnet) to learn the parameters for physical model inversion, and use the generated color enhancement image as auxiliary information for the Two-Stream Interaction Enhancement sub-network (TSIE-subnet). Meanwhile, we design a Degradation Quantization (DQ) module in TSIE-subnet to quantize scene degradation, thereby achieving reinforcing enhancement of key regions. On the other hand, we design the Dual-Discriminators for the style-content adversarial constraint, promoting the authenticity and visual aesthetics of the results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PUGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Noise Self-Regression: A New Learning Paradigm to Enhance Low-Light Images Without Task-Related Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04700v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a task of leveraging deep neural networks to enhance the image illumination while keeping the image content unchanged. From the perspective of training data, existing methods complete the LLIE task driven by one of the following three data types: paired data, unpaired data and zero-reference data. Each type of these data-driven methods has its own advantages, e.g., zero-reference data-based methods have very low requirements on training data and can meet the human needs in many scenarios. In this paper, we leverage pure Gaussian noise to complete the LLIE task, which further reduces the requirements for training data in LLIE tasks and can be used as another alternative in practical use. Specifically, we propose Noise SElf-Regression (NoiSER) without access to any task-related data, simply learns a convolutional neural network equipped with an instance-normalization layer by taking a random noise image, $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ for each pixel, as both input and output for each training pair, and then the low-light image is fed to the trained network for predicting the normal-light image. Technically, an intuitive explanation for its effectiveness is as follows: 1) the self-regression reconstructs the contrast between adjacent pixels of the input image, 2) the instance-normalization layer may naturally remediate the overall magnitude/lighting of the input image, and 3) the $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ assumption for each pixel enforces the output image to follow the well-known gray-world hypothesis when the image size is big enough. Compared to current state-of-the-art LLIE methods with access to different task-related data, NoiSER is highly competitive in enhancement quality, yet with a much smaller model size, and much lower training and inference cost. Besides, NoiSER also excels in mitigating overexposure and handling joint tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Joint Image De-noising and Enhancement for Satellite-Based SAR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12671v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstructed images from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data suffer from multiplicative noise as well as low contrast level. These two factors impact the quality of the SAR images significantly and prevent any attempt to extract valuable information from the processed data. The necessity for mitigating these effects in the field of SAR imaging is of high importance. Therefore, in this paper, we address the aforementioned issues and propose a technique to handle these shortcomings simultaneously. In fact, we combine the de-noising and contrast enhancement processes into a unified algorithm. The image enhancement is performed based on the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technique. The verification of the proposed algorithm is performed by experimental results based on the data that has been collected from the European Space Agency's ERS-2 satellite which operates in strip-map mode.</p></details> |  | None |

This degradation negatively affects the performance of autonomous underwater vehicles used in marine applications. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight phase-based transformer network with 1.77M parameters for underwater image restoration (UIR). Our approach focuses on effectively extracting non-contaminated features using a phase-based self-attention mechanism. We also introduce an optimized phase attention block to restore structural information by propagating prominent attentive features from the input. We evaluate our method on both synthetic (UIEB, UFO-120) and real-world (UIEB, U45, UCCS, SQUID) underwater image datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness for low-light image enhancement using the LOL dataset. Through extensive ablation studies and comparative analysis, it is clear that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> | None |
| **[LUIEO: A Lightweight Model for Integrating Underwater Image Enhancement and Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07009v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater optical images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors such as blurring, low contrast, and color distortion, which hinder the accuracy of object detection tasks. Due to the lack of paired underwater/clean images, most research methods adopt a strategy of first enhancing and then detecting, resulting in a lack of feature communication between the two learning tasks. On the other hand, due to the contradiction between the diverse degradation factors of underwater images and the limited number of samples, existing underwater enhancement methods are difficult to effectively enhance degraded images of unknown water bodies, thereby limiting the improvement of object detection accuracy. Therefore, most underwater target detection results are still displayed on degraded images, making it difficult to visually judge the correctness of the detection results. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-task learning method that simultaneously enhances underwater images and improves detection accuracy. Compared with single-task learning, the integrated model allows for the dynamic adjustment of information communication and sharing between different tasks. Due to the fact that real underwater images can only provide annotated object labels, this paper introduces physical constraints to ensure that object detection tasks do not interfere with image enhancement tasks. Therefore, this article introduces a physical module to decompose underwater images into clean images, background light, and transmission images and uses a physical model to calculate underwater images for self-supervision. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves satisfactory results in visual performance, object detection accuracy, and detection efficiency compared to state-of-the-art comparative methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BiCo-Fusion: Bidirectional Complementary LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Semantic- and Spatial-Aware 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19048v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts.

Existing low-light image enhancement techniques using Fourier transform have mainly focused on amplifying the amplitude component and simply replicating the phase component, an approach that often leads to color distortions and noise issues. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Stage Multi-Branch Fourier Low-Light Image Enhancement (DMFourLLIE) framework to address these limitations by emphasizing the phase component's role in preserving image structure and detail. The first stage integrates structural information from infrared images to enhance the phase component and employs a luminance-attention mechanism in the luminance-chrominance color space to precisely control amplitude enhancement. The second stage combines multi-scale and Fourier convolutional branches for robust image reconstruction, effectively recovering spatial structures and textures. This dual-branch joint optimization process ensures that complex image information is retained, overcoming the limitations of previous methods that neglected the interplay between amplitude and phase. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DMFourLLIE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in low-light image enhancement.

However, over-reliance on image enhancement, scarcity of high-quality nighttime data, and neglecting the relationship between daytime and nighttime trackers, which hinders the development of an end-to-end trainable framework. Moreover, current CNN-based trackers have limited receptive fields, leading to suboptimal performance, while ViT-based trackers demand heavy computational resources due to their reliance on the self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel pure Mamba-based tracking framework (\textbf{MambaNUT}) that employs a state space model with linear complexity as its backbone, incorporating a single-stream architecture that integrates feature learning and template-search coupling within Vision Mamba. We introduce an adaptive curriculum learning (ACL) approach that dynamically adjusts sampling strategies and loss weights, thereby improving the model's ability of generalization. Our ACL is composed of two levels of curriculum schedulers: (1) sampling scheduler that transforms the data distribution from imbalanced to balanced, as well as from easier (daytime) to harder (nighttime) samples; (2) loss scheduler that dynamically assigns weights based on data frequency and the IOU. Exhaustive experiments on multiple nighttime UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MambaNUT achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring lower computational costs.

| **[HUPE: Heuristic Underwater Perceptual Enhancement with Semantic Collaborative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18296v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images are often affected by light refraction and absorption, reducing visibility and interfering with subsequent applications. Existing underwater image enhancement methods primarily focus on improving visual quality while overlooking practical implications. To strike a balance between visual quality and application, we propose a heuristic invertible network for underwater perception enhancement, dubbed HUPE, which enhances visual quality and demonstrates flexibility in handling other downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduced an information-preserving reversible transformation with embedded Fourier transform to establish a bidirectional mapping between underwater images and their clear images. Additionally, a heuristic prior is incorporated into the enhancement process to better capture scene information. To further bridge the feature gap between vision-based enhancement images and application-oriented images, a semantic collaborative learning module is applied in the joint optimization process of the visual enhancement task and the downstream task, which guides the proposed enhancement model to extract more task-oriented semantic features while obtaining visually pleasing images. Extensive experiments, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrate the superiority of our HUPE over state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Self-Supervised Denoiser Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19593v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing images using Computed Tomography (CT) in an industrial context leads to specific challenges that differ from those encountered in other areas, such as clinical CT. Indeed, non-destructive testing with industrial CT will often involve scanning multiple similar objects while maintaining high throughput, requiring short scanning times, which is not a relevant concern in clinical CT. Under-sampling the tomographic data (sinograms) is a natural way to reduce the scanning time at the cost of image quality since the latter depends on the number of measurements. In such a scenario, post-processing techniques are required to compensate for the image artifacts induced by the sinogram sparsity. We introduce the Self-supervised Denoiser Framework (SDF), a self-supervised training method that leverages pre-training on highly sampled sinogram data to enhance the quality of images reconstructed from undersampled sinogram data. The main contribution of SDF is that it proposes to train an image denoiser in the sinogram space by setting the learning task as the prediction of one sinogram subset from another. As such, it does not require ground-truth image data, leverages the abundant data modality in CT, the sinogram, and can drastically enhance the quality of images reconstructed from a fraction of the measurements. We demonstrate that SDF produces better image quality, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, than other analytical and self-supervised frameworks in both 2D fan-beam or 3D cone-beam CT settings. Moreover, we show that the enhancement provided by SDF carries over when fine-tuning the image denoiser on a few examples, making it a suitable pre-training technique in a context where there is little high-quality image data. Our results are established on experimental datasets, making SDF a strong candidate for being the building block of foundational image-enhancement models in CT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Consistency-Based Image Generation via Adversarialy-Trained Classification and Energy-Based Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16260v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently introduced Consistency models pose an efficient alternative to diffusion algorithms, enabling rapid and good quality image synthesis. These methods overcome the slowness of diffusion models by directly mapping noise to data, while maintaining a (relatively) simpler training. Consistency models enable a fast one- or few-step generation, but they typically fall somewhat short in sample quality when compared to their diffusion origins. In this work we propose a novel and highly effective technique for post-processing Consistency-based generated images, enhancing their perceptual quality. Our approach utilizes a joint classifier-discriminator model, in which both portions are trained adversarially. While the classifier aims to grade an image based on its assignment to a designated class, the discriminator portion of the very same network leverages the softmax values to assess the proximity of the input image to the targeted data manifold, thereby serving as an Energy-based Model. By employing example-specific projected gradient iterations under the guidance of this joint machine, we refine synthesized images and achieve an improved FID scores on the ImageNet 64x64 dataset for both Consistency-Training and Consistency-Distillation techniques.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Joint RGB-Spectral Decomposition Model Guided Image Enhancement in Mobile Photography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17996v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of miniaturized spectrometers into mobile devices offers new avenues for image quality enhancement and facilitates novel downstream tasks. However, the broader application of spectral sensors in mobile photography is hindered by the inherent complexity of spectral images and the constraints of spectral imaging capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint RGB-Spectral decomposition model guided enhancement framework, which consists of two steps: joint decomposition and prior-guided enhancement. Firstly, we leverage the complementarity between RGB and Low-resolution Multi-Spectral Images (Lr-MSI) to predict shading, reflectance, and material semantic priors. Subsequently, these priors are seamlessly integrated into the established HDRNet to promote dynamic range enhancement, color mapping, and grid expert learning, respectively. Additionally, we construct a high-quality Mobile-Spec dataset to support our research, and our experiments validate the effectiveness of Lr-MSI in the tone enhancement task. This work aims to establish a solid foundation for advancing spectral vision in mobile photography.

This work aims to evaluate state-of-the-art image enhancement models, investigate their impact on underwater object detection, and explore their potential to improve detection performance. To this end, we selected representative underwater image enhancement models covering major enhancement categories and applied them separately to two recent datasets: 1) the Real-World Underwater Object Detection Dataset (RUOD), and 2) the Challenging Underwater Plant Detection Dataset (CUPDD). Following this, we conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses on the enhanced images and developed a quality index (Q-index) to compare the quality distribution of the original and enhanced images. Subsequently, we compared the performance of several YOLO-NAS detection models that are separately trained and tested on the original and enhanced image sets. Then, we performed a correlation study to examine the relationship between enhancement metrics and detection performance. We also analyzed the inference results from the trained detectors presenting cases where enhancement increased the detection performance as well as cases where enhancement revealed missed objects by human annotators. This study suggests that although enhancement generally deteriorates the detection performance, it can still be harnessed in some cases for increased detection performance and more accurate human annotation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semi-supervised Underwater Image Enhancement Using A Physics-Aware Triple-Stream Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11470v3)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images normally suffer from degradation due to the transmission medium of water bodies. Both traditional prior-based approaches and deep learning-based methods have been used to address this problem. However, the inflexible assumption of the former often impairs their effectiveness in handling diverse underwater scenes, while the generalization of the latter to unseen images is usually weakened by insufficient data. In this study, we leverage both the physics-based Image Formation Model (IFM) and deep learning techniques for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE). To this end, we propose a novel Physics-Aware Triple-Stream Underwater Image Enhancement Network, i.e., PATS-UIENet, which comprises a Direct Signal Transmission Estimation Steam (D-Stream), a Backscatter Signal Transmission Estimation Steam (B-Stream) and an Ambient Light Estimation Stream (A-Stream). This network fulfills the UIE task by explicitly estimating the degradation parameters of a revised IFM. We also adopt an IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework, which exploits both the labeled and unlabeled images, to address the issue of insufficient data. To our knowledge, such a physics-aware deep network and the IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework have not been used for the UIE task before. Our method performs better than, or at least comparably to, sixteen baselines across six testing sets in the degradation estimation and UIE tasks. These promising results should be due to the fact that the proposed method can not only model the degradation but also learn the characteristics of diverse underwater scenes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |

Existing methods primarily address image enhancement with approaches that hinge on storing the full-size input. In contrast, we introduce the Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder (CE-VAE), a novel architecture designed to efficiently compress and enhance degraded underwater images. Our attention-aware image encoder can project the input image onto a latent space representation while being able to run online on a remote device. The only information that needs to be stored on the device or sent to a beacon is a compressed representation. There is a dual-decoder module that performs offline, full-size enhanced image generation. One branch reconstructs spatial details from the compressed latent space, while the second branch utilizes a capsule-clustering layer to capture entity-level structures and complex spatial relationships. This parallel decoding strategy enables the model to balance fine-detail preservation with context-aware enhancements. CE-VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image enhancement on six benchmark datasets, providing up to 3x higher compression efficiency than existing approaches.

Meanwhile, limited by poor lighting and content guidance, existing zero-shot methods cannot handle unknown severe degradation well. To address this problem, we will propose a new zero-shot low-light enhancement method to compensate for the lack of light and structural information in the diffusion sampling process by effectively combining the wavelet and Fourier frequency domains to construct rich a priori information. The key to the inspiration comes from the similarity between the wavelet and Fourier frequency domains: both light and structure information are closely related to specific frequency domain regions, respectively. Therefore, by transferring the diffusion process to the wavelet low-frequency domain and combining the wavelet and Fourier frequency domains by continuously decomposing them in the inverse process, the constructed rich illumination prior is utilised to guide the image generation enhancement process. Sufficient experiments show that the framework is robust and effective in various scenarios.

Current acceleration methods, whether training-based or training-free, often lead to significant performance degradation, highlighting the trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we identify two primary factors contributing to performance degradation: fitting errors and the inference gap. Our key insight is that fitting errors can be mitigated by linearly extrapolating the incorrect score functions, while the inference gap can be reduced by shifting the Gaussian flow to a reflectance-aware residual space. Based on the above insights, we design Reflectance-Aware Trajectory Refinement (RATR) module, a simple yet effective module to refine the teacher trajectory using the reflectance component of images. Following this, we introduce \textbf{Re}flectance-aware \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{Di}stilled \textbf{T}rajectory (\textbf{ReDDiT}), an efficient and flexible distillation framework tailored for LLIE. Our framework achieves comparable performance to previous diffusion-based methods with redundant steps in just 2 steps while establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with 8 or 4 steps. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on 10 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing SOTA methods.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Current approaches to address SR tasks, such as transformer-based and diffusion-based methods, are either dedicated to extracting RGB image features or assuming similar degradation patterns, neglecting the inherent modal disparities between infrared and visible images. When directly applied to infrared image SR tasks, these methods inevitably distort the infrared spectral distribution, compromising the machine perception in downstream tasks. In this work, we emphasize the infrared spectral distribution fidelity and propose a Contourlet refinement gate framework to restore infrared modal-specific features while preserving spectral distribution fidelity. Our approach captures high-pass subbands from multi-scale and multi-directional infrared spectral decomposition to recover infrared-degraded information through a gate architecture. The proposed Spectral Fidelity Loss regularizes the spectral frequency distribution during reconstruction, which ensures the preservation of both high- and low-frequency components and maintains the fidelity of infrared-specific features. We propose a two-stage prompt-learning optimization to guide the model in learning infrared HR characteristics from LR degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image SR models in both visual and perceptual tasks while notably enhancing machine perception in downstream tasks.

By employing a fixed-point-inspired iterative approach to invert real-world images, we observe that the solution does not achieve convergence, instead oscillating between distinct clusters. Through both toy experiments and real-world diffusion models, we demonstrate that these oscillating clusters exhibit notable semantic coherence. We offer theoretical insights, showing that this behavior arises from oscillatory dynamics in rectified flow models. Building on this understanding, we introduce a simple and fast distribution transfer technique that facilitates image enhancement, stroke-based recoloring, as well as visual prompt-guided image editing. Furthermore, we provide quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for tasks such as image enhancement, makeup transfer, reconstruction quality, and guided sampling quality.

Due to the application of deep learning, current UIE methods have made significant progress. Most of the existing deep learning-based UIE methods follow a single-stage network which cannot effectively address the diverse degradations simultaneously. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by designing a two-stage deep learning framework and taking advantage of cascaded contrastive learning to guide the network training of each stage. The proposed method is called CCL-Net in short. Specifically, the proposed CCL-Net involves two cascaded stages, i.e., a color correction stage tailored to the color deviation issue and a haze removal stage tailored to improve the visibility and contrast of underwater images. To guarantee the underwater image can be progressively enhanced, we also apply contrastive loss as an additional constraint to guide the training of each stage. In the first stage, the raw underwater images are used as negative samples for building the first contrastive loss, ensuring the enhanced results of the first color correction stage are better than the original inputs. While in the second stage, the enhanced results rather than the raw underwater images of the first color correction stage are used as the negative samples for building the second contrastive loss, thus ensuring the final enhanced results of the second haze removal stage are better than the intermediate color corrected results. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CCL-Net can achieve superior performance compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information.

The challenge lies in the domain gap between low-quality images observed by the moving robot, characterized by motion blur and low-resolution, and high-quality query images provided by the user. Such domain gaps could significantly reduce the task success rate but have not been the focus of previous work. To address this, we propose a novel method called Few-shot Cross-quality Instance-aware Adaptation (CrossIA), which employs contrastive learning with an instance classifier to align features between massive low- and few high-quality images. This approach effectively reduces the domain gap by bringing the latent representations of cross-quality images closer on an instance basis. Additionally, the system integrates an object image collection with a pre-trained deblurring model to enhance the observed image quality. Our method fine-tunes the SimSiam model, pre-trained on ImageNet, using CrossIA. We evaluated our method's effectiveness through an InstanceImageNav task with 20 different types of instances, where the robot identifies the same instance in a real-world environment as a high-quality query image. Our experiments showed that our method improves the task success rate by up to three times compared to the baseline, a conventional approach based on SuperGlue. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging contrastive learning and image enhancement techniques to bridge the domain gap and improve object localization in robotic applications.

| **[TPOT: Topology Preserving Optimal Transport in Retinal Fundus Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01403v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal fundus photography enhancement is important for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases. However, early approaches to retinal image enhancement, such as those based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), often struggle to preserve the complex topological information of blood vessels, resulting in spurious or missing vessel structures. The persistence diagram, which captures topological features based on the persistence of topological structures under different filtrations, provides a promising way to represent the structure information. In this work, we propose a topology-preserving training paradigm that regularizes blood vessel structures by minimizing the differences of persistence diagrams. We call the resulting framework Topology Preserving Optimal Transport (TPOT). Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised techniques, both in terms of image quality and performance in the downstream blood vessel segmentation task.

Existing methods often suffer from various challenges such as sacrificing global image characteristics over local image characteristics or vice versa. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called G-CLAHE (Global-Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), which perfectly suits medical imaging with a focus on X-rays. This method adapts from Global Histogram Equalization (GHE) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to take both advantages and avoid weakness to preserve local and global characteristics. Experimental results show that it can significantly improve current state-of-the-art algorithms to effectively address their limitations and enhance the contrast and quality of X-ray images for diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image Synthesis with Class-Aware Semantic Diffusion Models for Surgical Scene Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23962v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical scene segmentation is essential for enhancing surgical precision, yet it is frequently compromised by the scarcity and imbalance of available data. To address these challenges, semantic image synthesis methods based on generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have been developed. However, these models often yield non-diverse images and fail to capture small, critical tissue classes, limiting their effectiveness. In response, we propose the Class-Aware Semantic Diffusion Model (CASDM), a novel approach which utilizes segmentation maps as conditions for image synthesis to tackle data scarcity and imbalance. Novel class-aware mean squared error and class-aware self-perceptual loss functions have been defined to prioritize critical, less visible classes, thereby enhancing image quality and relevance. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we are the first to generate multi-class segmentation maps using text prompts in a novel fashion to specify their contents. These maps are then used by CASDM to generate surgical scene images, enhancing datasets for training and validating segmentation models. Our evaluation, which assesses both image quality and downstream segmentation performance, demonstrates the strong effectiveness and generalisability of CASDM in producing realistic image-map pairs, significantly advancing surgical scene segmentation across diverse and challenging datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Noise reduction from images is still a challenging task. Digital Image Processing is a component of Digital signal processing. A wide variety of algorithms can be used in image processing to apply to an image or an input dataset and obtain important outcomes. In image processing research, removing noise from images before further analysis is essential. Post-noise removal of images improves clarity, enabling better interpretation and analysis across medical imaging, satellite imagery, and radar applications. While numerous algorithms exist, each comes with its own assumptions, strengths, and limitations. The paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different filtering techniques on images with eight types of noise. It evaluates methodologies like Wiener, Median, Gaussian, Mean, Low pass, High pass, Laplacian and bilateral filtering, using the performance metric Peak signal to noise ratio. It shows us the impact of different filters on noise models by applying a variety of filters to various kinds of noise. Additionally, it also assists us in determining which filtering strategy is most appropriate for a certain noise model based on the circumstances.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Wavelet-based Mamba with Fourier Adjustment for Low-light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20314v1)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frequency information (e.g., Discrete Wavelet Transform and Fast Fourier Transform) has been widely applied to solve the issue of Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE). However, existing frequency-based models primarily operate in the simple wavelet or Fourier space of images, which lacks utilization of valid global and local information in each space. We found that wavelet frequency information is more sensitive to global brightness due to its low-frequency component while Fourier frequency information is more sensitive to local details due to its phase component. In order to achieve superior preliminary brightness enhancement by optimally integrating spatial channel information with low-frequency components in the wavelet transform, we introduce channel-wise Mamba, which compensates for the long-range dependencies of CNNs and has lower complexity compared to Diffusion and Transformer models. So in this work, we propose a novel Wavelet-based Mamba with Fourier Adjustment model called WalMaFa, consisting of a Wavelet-based Mamba Block (WMB) and a Fast Fourier Adjustment Block (FFAB). We employ an Encoder-Latent-Decoder structure to accomplish the end-to-end transformation. Specifically, WMB is adopted in the Encoder and Decoder to enhance global brightness while FFAB is adopted in the Latent to fine-tune local texture details and alleviate ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed WalMaFa achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer computational resources and faster speed.

| **[Capsule Endoscopy Image Enhancement for Small Intestinal Villi Clarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15977v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents, for the first time, an image enhancement methodology designed to enhance the clarity of small intestinal villi in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images. This method first separates the low-frequency and high-frequency components of small intestinal villi images using guided filtering. Subsequently, an adaptive light gain factor is generated based on the low-frequency component, and an adaptive gradient gain factor is derived from the convolution results of the Laplacian operator in different regions of small intestinal villi images. The obtained light gain factor and gradient gain factor are then combined to enhance the high-frequency components. Finally, the enhanced high-frequency component is fused with the original image to achieve adaptive sharpening of the edges of WCE small intestinal villi images. The experiments affirm that, compared to established WCE image enhancement methods, our approach not only accentuates the edge details of WCE small intestine villi images but also skillfully suppresses noise amplification, thereby preventing the occurrence of edge overshooting.</p></details> |  | None |

To improve robustness, we study an image enhancement method that generates recognition-friendly images without retraining the recognition model. We propose a novel image enhancement method, DynTTA, which is based on differentiable data augmentation techniques and generates a blended image from many augmented images to improve the recognition accuracy under distribution shifts. In addition to standard data augmentations, DynTTA also incorporates deep neural network-based image transformation, further improving the robustness. Because DynTTA is composed of differentiable functions, it can be directly trained with the classification loss of the recognition model. In experiments with widely used image recognition datasets using various classification models, DynTTA improves the robustness with almost no reduction in classification accuracy for clean images, thus outperforming the existing methods. Furthermore, the results show that robustness is significantly improved by estimating the training-time augmentations for distribution-shifted datasets using DynTTA and retraining the recognition model with the estimated augmentations. DynTTA is a promising approach for applications that require both clean accuracy and robustness.

Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that is only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS) network. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect the high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes with LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE network (SSLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS auxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate embedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate layer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE. SSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks to a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating training mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike currently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the semantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby leading to a more promising enhancement performance. Comparisons between the proposed SLLEN and other state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the superiority of SLLEN with respect to LLE quality over all the comparable alternatives.</p></details> |  | None |

A widely-used manner is to see how accurately an object detector trained on enhanced low-light images by different candidates can perform with respect to annotated semantic labels. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the mentioned approach is generally prone to overfitting, and thus diminishes its measurement reliability. In search of a proper evaluation metric, we propose LIME-Bench, the first online benchmark platform designed to collect human preferences for low-light enhancement, providing a valuable dataset for validating the correlation between human perception and automated evaluation metrics. We then customize LIME-Eval, a novel evaluation framework that utilizes detectors pre-trained on standard-lighting datasets without object annotations, to judge the quality of enhanced images. By adopting an energy-based strategy to assess the accuracy of output confidence maps, our LIME-Eval can simultaneously bypass biases associated with retraining detectors and circumvent the reliance on annotations for dim images. Comprehensive experiments are provided to reveal the effectiveness of our LIME-Eval.

Despite substantial research on improving low-quality images captured in underexposed conditions, clear vision remains critical for autonomous vehicles, which often struggle with low-light scenarios, signifying the need for continuous research. However, paired datasets for LLIE are scarce, particularly for street scenes, limiting the development of robust LLIE methods. Despite using advanced transformers and/or diffusion-based models, current LLIE methods struggle in real-world low-light conditions and lack training on street-scene datasets, limiting their effectiveness for autonomous vehicles. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a new dataset LoLI-Street (Low-Light Images of Streets) with 33k paired low-light and well-exposed images from street scenes in developed cities, covering 19k object classes for object detection. LoLI-Street dataset also features 1,000 real low-light test images for testing LLIE models under real-life conditions. Furthermore, we propose a transformer and diffusion-based LLIE model named "TriFuse". Leveraging the LoLI-Street dataset, we train and evaluate our TriFuse and SOTA models to benchmark on our dataset. Comparing various models, our dataset's generalization feasibility is evident in testing across different mainstream datasets by significantly enhancing images and object detection for practical applications in autonomous driving and surveillance systems.

Autonomous driving systems heavily rely on accurate object detection algorithms, but adverse weather conditions can significantly impact the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing approaches include image enhancement techniques like IA-YOLO and domain adaptation methods. While image enhancement aims to generate clear images from foggy ones, which is more challenging than object detection in foggy images, domain adaptation does not require labeled data in the target domain. Our approach involves fine-tuning on a specific dataset to address these challenges efficiently. FogGuard compensates for foggy conditions in the scene, ensuring robust performance by incorporating YOLOv3 as the baseline algorithm and introducing a unique Teacher-Student Perceptual loss for accurate object detection in foggy environments. Through comprehensive evaluations on standard datasets like PASCAL VOC and RTTS, our network significantly improves performance, achieving a 69.43\% mAP compared to YOLOv3's 57.78\% on the RTTS dataset.

However, few algorithms leverage the compression distortion prior from existing compression algorithms to improve RD performance. In this paper, we propose a latent diffusion model-based remote sensing image compression (LDM-RSIC) method, which aims to enhance the final decoding quality of RS images by utilizing the generated distortion prior from a LDM. Our approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, a self-encoder learns prior from the high-quality input image. In the second stage, the prior is generated through an LDM, conditioned on the decoded image of an existing learning-based image compression algorithm, to be used as auxiliary information for generating the texture-rich enhanced image. To better utilize the prior, a channel attention and gate-based dynamic feature attention module (DFAM) is embedded into a Transformer-based multi-scale enhancement network (MEN) for image enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed LDM-RSIC significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based image compression algorithms in terms of both subjective perception and objective metrics. Additionally, we use the LDM-based scheme to improve the traditional image compression algorithm JPEG2000 and obtain 32.00% bit savings on the DOTA testing set.

Conventional methods address this issue by utilizing large datasets to extract rich representations for IQA. Also, some approaches propose vision language models (VLM) based IQA, but the domain gap between generic VLM and IQA constrains their scalability. In this work, we propose a novel pretraining framework that constructs a generalizable representation for IQA by selectively extracting quality-related knowledge from VLM and leveraging the scalability of large datasets. Specifically, we select optimal text prompts for five representative image quality attributes and use VLM to generate pseudo-labels. Numerous attribute-aware pseudo-labels can be generated with large image datasets, allowing our IQA model to learn rich representations about image quality. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple IQA datasets and exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities.

However, the research and design of touchscreen mobile keyboards -- one of the most speed and accuracy demanding touch interfaces -- has focused on the location of the touch centroid derived from the touch image heatmap as the input, discarding the rest of the raw spatial signals. In this paper, we investigate whether touch heatmaps can be leveraged to further improve the tap decoding accuracy for mobile touchscreen keyboards. Specifically, we developed and evaluated machine-learning models that interpret user taps by using the centroids and/or the heatmaps as their input and studied the contribution of the heatmaps to model performance. The results show that adding the heatmap into the input feature set led to 21.4% relative reduction of character error rates on average, compared to using the centroid alone. Furthermore, we conducted a live user study with the centroid-based and heatmap-based decoders built into Pixel 6 Pro devices and observed lower error rate, faster typing speed, and higher self-reported satisfaction score based on the heatmap-based decoder than the centroid-based decoder. These findings underline the promise of utilizing touch heatmaps for improving typing experience in mobile keyboards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to UIST 2024</p></details> | None |

Recently, studies on generalizable NeRF (G-NeRF) have addressed the challenge of per-scene optimization in NeRFs. The construction of radiance fields on-the-fly in G-NeRF simplifies the NVS process, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Meanwhile, G-NeRF still struggles in representing fine details for a specific scene due to the absence of per-scene optimization, even with texture-rich multi-view source inputs.

Additionally, the proposed texture preserving transformer (TP-Former) aggregates multi-view source features while preserving texture information. Consequently, our module enables direct interaction between adjacent pixels during the image enhancement process, which is deficient in G-NeRF models with an independent rendering process per pixel. This addresses constraints that hinder the ability to capture high-frequency details.

Most existing underwater image enhancement algorithms produce a single, fixed-color image, limiting user flexibility and application. To address this limitation, we propose a method called \textit{ColorCode}, which enhances underwater images while offering a range of controllable color outputs. Our approach involves recovering an underwater image to a reference enhanced image through supervised training and decomposing it into color and content codes via self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction. The color code is explicitly constrained to follow a Gaussian distribution, allowing for efficient sampling and interpolation during inference. ColorCode offers three key features: 1) color enhancement, producing an enhanced image with a fixed color; 2) color adaptation, enabling controllable adjustments of long-wavelength color components using guidance images; and 3) color interpolation, allowing for the smooth generation of multiple colors through continuous sampling of the color code. Quantitative and visual evaluations on popular and challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of ColorCode over existing methods in providing diverse, controllable, and color-realistic enhancement results.

However, these approaches often incur substantial memory requirements, particularly when processing ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. In this paper, we propose a novel image restoration method called MixNet, which introduces an alternative approach to global modeling approaches and is more effective for UHD image restoration. To capture the longrange dependency of features without introducing excessive computational complexity, we present the Global Feature Modulation Layer (GFML). GFML associates features from different views by permuting the feature maps, enabling efficient modeling of long-range dependency. In addition, we also design the Local Feature Modulation Layer (LFML) and Feed-forward Layer (FFL) to capture local features and transform features into a compact representation. This way, our MixNetachieves effective restoration with low inference time overhead and computational complexity.

| **[Three-stage binarization of color document images based on discrete wavelet transform and generative adversarial networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16098v8)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient extraction of text information from the background in degraded color document images is an important challenge in the preservation of ancient manuscripts. The imperfect preservation of ancient manuscripts has led to different types of degradation over time, such as page yellowing, staining, and ink bleeding, seriously affecting the results of document image binarization. This work proposes an effective three-stage network method to image enhancement and binarization of degraded documents using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, in Stage-1, we first split the input images into multiple patches, and then split these patches into four single-channel patch images (gray, red, green, and blue). Then, three single-channel patch images (red, green, and blue) are processed by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with normalization. In Stage-2, we use four independent generators to separately train GAN models based on the four channels on the processed patch images to extract color foreground information. Finally, in Stage-3, we train two independent GAN models on the outputs of Stage-2 and the resized original input images (512x512) as the local and global predictions to obtain the final outputs. The experimental results show that the Avg-Score metrics of the proposed method are 77.64, 77.95, 79.05, 76.38, 75.34, and 77.00 on the (H)-DIBCO 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018 datasets, which are at the state-of-the-art level.

| **[PDCFNet: Enhancing Underwater Images through Pixel Difference Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19269v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majority of deep learning methods utilize vanilla convolution for enhancing underwater images. While vanilla convolution excels in capturing local features and learning the spatial hierarchical structure of images, it tends to smooth input images, which can somewhat limit feature expression and modeling. A prominent characteristic of underwater degraded images is blur, and the goal of enhancement is to make the textures and details (high-frequency features) in the images more visible. Therefore, we believe that leveraging high-frequency features can improve enhancement performance. To address this, we introduce Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC), which focuses on gradient information with significant changes in the image, thereby improving the modeling of enhanced images. We propose an underwater image enhancement network, PDCFNet, based on PDC and cross-level feature fusion. Specifically, we design a detail enhancement module based on PDC that employs parallel PDCs to capture high-frequency features, leading to better detail and texture enhancement. The designed cross-level feature fusion module performs operations such as concatenation and multiplication on features from different levels, ensuring sufficient interaction and enhancement between diverse features. Our proposed PDCFNet achieves a PSNR of 27.37 and an SSIM of 92.02 on the UIEB dataset, attaining the best performance to date.

| **[Unsupervised Low-light Image Enhancement with Lookup Tables and Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18899v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light image enhancement (LIE) aims at precisely and efficiently recovering an image degraded in poor illumination environments. Recent advanced LIE techniques are using deep neural networks, which require lots of low-normal light image pairs, network parameters, and computational resources. As a result, their practicality is limited. In this work, we devise a novel unsupervised LIE framework based on diffusion priors and lookup tables (DPLUT) to achieve efficient low-light image recovery. The proposed approach comprises two critical components: a light adjustment lookup table (LLUT) and a noise suppression lookup table (NLUT). LLUT is optimized with a set of unsupervised losses. It aims at predicting pixel-wise curve parameters for the dynamic range adjustment of a specific image. NLUT is designed to remove the amplified noise after the light brightens. As diffusion models are sensitive to noise, diffusion priors are introduced to achieve high-performance noise suppression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Underwater Image Enhancement with Physical-based Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18476v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater vision is crucial for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and enhancing degraded underwater images in real-time on a resource-constrained AUV is a key challenge due to factors like light absorption and scattering, or the sufficient model computational complexity to resolve such factors. Traditional image enhancement techniques lack adaptability to varying underwater conditions, while learning-based methods, particularly those using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), offer more robust solutions but face limitations such as inadequate enhancement, unstable training, or mode collapse. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach in image-to-image tasks but require intensive computational complexity to achieve the desired underwater image enhancement (UIE) using the recent UW-DDPM solution. To address these challenges, this paper introduces UW-DiffPhys, a novel physical-based and diffusion-based UIE approach. UW-DiffPhys combines light-computation physical-based UIE network components with a denoising U-Net to replace the computationally intensive distribution transformation U-Net in the existing UW-DDPM framework, reducing complexity while maintaining performance. Additionally, the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) is employed to accelerate the inference process through non-Markovian sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that UW-DiffPhys achieved a substantial reduction in computational complexity and inference time compared to UW-DDPM, with competitive performance in key metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, UCIQE, and an improvement in the overall underwater image quality UIQM metric.

Ensuring high image quality in CBCT scans is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment delivery. Yet, the susceptibility of CBCT images to noise and artifacts undermines both their usefulness and reliability. Existing methods typically address CBCT artifacts through image-to-image translation approaches. These methods, however, are limited by the artifact types present in the training data, which may not cover the complete spectrum of CBCT degradations stemming from variations in imaging protocols. Gathering additional data to encompass all possible scenarios can often pose a challenge. To address this, we present SinoSynth, a physics-based degradation model that simulates various CBCT-specific artifacts to generate a diverse set of synthetic CBCT images from high-quality CT images without requiring pre-aligned data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that several different generative networks trained on our synthesized data achieve remarkable results on heterogeneous multi-institutional datasets, outperforming even the same networks trained on actual data. We further show that our degradation model conveniently provides an avenue to enforce anatomical constraints in conditional generative models, yielding high-quality and structure-preserving synthetic CT images.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 | None |

| **[Semi-LLIE: Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning with Mamba-based Low-light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16604v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive advancements made in recent low-light image enhancement techniques, the scarcity of paired data has emerged as a significant obstacle to further advancements. This work proposes a mean-teacher-based semi-supervised low-light enhancement (Semi-LLIE) framework that integrates the unpaired data into model training. The mean-teacher technique is a prominent semi-supervised learning method, successfully adopted for addressing high-level and low-level vision tasks. However, two primary issues hinder the naive mean-teacher method from attaining optimal performance in low-light image enhancement. Firstly, pixel-wise consistency loss is insufficient for transferring realistic illumination distribution from the teacher to the student model, which results in color cast in the enhanced images. Secondly, cutting-edge image enhancement approaches fail to effectively cooperate with the mean-teacher framework to restore detailed information in dark areas due to their tendency to overlook modeling structured information within local regions. To mitigate the above issues, we first introduce a semantic-aware contrastive loss to faithfully transfer the illumination distribution, contributing to enhancing images with natural colors. Then, we design a Mamba-based low-light image enhancement backbone to effectively enhance Mamba's local region pixel relationship representation ability with a multi-scale feature learning scheme, facilitating the generation of images with rich textural details. Further, we propose novel perceptive loss based on the large-scale vision-language Recognize Anything Model (RAM) to help generate enhanced images with richer textual details. The experimental results indicate that our Semi-LLIE surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

These attacks have evolved in sophistication with the advent of deep learning, presenting significant challenges in critical applications, which can be harmful for society. However, there is also a rich line of research from a transformative perspective that leverages adversarial techniques for social good. Specifically, we examine the rise of proactive schemes-methods that encrypt input data using additional signals termed templates, to enhance the performance of deep learning models. By embedding these imperceptible templates into digital media, proactive schemes are applied across various applications, from simple image enhancements to complicated deep learning frameworks to aid performance, as compared to the passive schemes, which don't change the input data distribution for their framework. The survey delves into the methodologies behind these proactive schemes, the encryption and learning processes, and their application to modern computer vision and natural language processing applications. Additionally, it discusses the challenges, potential vulnerabilities, and future directions for proactive schemes, ultimately highlighting their potential to foster the responsible and secure advancement of deep learning technologies.</p></details> | Submitted for review | None |

The primary goal of LLIE is to generate clearer images that are more visually pleasing to humans. However, the impact of LLIE methods in high-level vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection, which rely on high-quality image datasets, is not well {explored}. To explore the impact, we comprehensively evaluate LLIE methods on these high-level vision tasks by utilizing an empirical investigation comprising image classification and object detection experiments. The evaluation reveals a dichotomy: {\textit{While Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods enhance human visual interpretation, their effect on computer vision tasks is inconsistent and can sometimes be harmful. }} Our findings suggest a disconnect between image enhancement for human visual perception and for machine analysis, indicating a need for LLIE methods tailored to support high-level vision tasks effectively. This insight is crucial for the development of LLIE techniques that align with the needs of both human and machine vision.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures | None |

By applying Eigenspace-Based Minimum Variance (EBMV) beamforming and employing a denoising diffusion model fine-tuned on ultrasound data, our method computes the variance across multiple diffusion-denoised samples to produce high-quality despeckled images. This approach leverages both the inherent multiplicative noise of ultrasound and the stochastic nature of diffusion models.

However, systemic imperfections and operator/patient-related factors can hinder the acquisition of high-quality retinal images. Previous efforts in retinal image enhancement primarily relied on GANs, which are limited by the trade-off between training stability and output diversity. In contrast, the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB), offers a more stable solution by utilizing Optimal Transport (OT) theory to model a stochastic differential equation (SDE) between two arbitrary distributions. This allows SB to effectively transform low-quality retinal images into their high-quality counterparts. In this work, we leverage the SB framework to propose an image-to-image translation pipeline for retinal image enhancement. Additionally, previous methods often fail to capture fine structural details, such as blood vessels. To address this, we enhance our pipeline by introducing Dynamic Snake Convolution, whose tortuous receptive field can better preserve tubular structures. We name the resulting retinal fundus image enhancement framework the Context-aware Unpaired Neural Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge (CUNSB-RFIE). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first endeavor to use the SB approach for retinal image enhancement. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods in terms of image quality and performance on downstream tasks.The code is available at https://github.com/Retinal-Research/CUNSB-RFIE .</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Retinal-Research/CUNSB-RFIE) |
| **[Underwater Image Enhancement via Dehazing and Color Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09779v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of marine engineering projects such as marine resource extraction and oceanic surveys, underwater visual imaging and analysis has become a critical technology. Unfortunately, due to the inevitable non-linear attenuation of light in underwater environments, underwater images and videos often suffer from low contrast, blurriness, and color degradation, which significantly complicate the subsequent research. Existing underwater image enhancement methods often treat the haze and color cast as a unified degradation process and disregard their independence and interdependence, which limits the performance improvement. Here, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based network (referred to as WaterFormer) to improve the underwater image quality. WaterFormer contains three major components: a dehazing block (DehazeFormer Block) to capture the self-correlated haze features and extract deep-level features, a Color Restoration Block (CRB) to capture self-correlated color cast features, and a Channel Fusion Block (CFB) to capture fusion features within the network. To ensure authenticity, a soft reconstruction layer based on the underwater imaging physics model is included. To improve the quality of the enhanced images, we introduce the Chromatic Consistency Loss and Sobel Color Loss to train the network. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that WaterFormer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in enhancing underwater images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, high-quality retinal images are crucial for carrying out accurate diagnoses and automated analyses. The fundus image enhancement is typically formulated as a distribution alignment problem, by finding a one-to-one mapping between a low-quality image and its high-quality counterpart. This paper proposes a context-informed optimal transport (OT) learning framework for tackling unpaired fundus image enhancement. In contrast to standard generative image enhancement methods, which struggle with handling contextual information (e.g., over-tampered local structures and unwanted artifacts), the proposed context-aware OT learning paradigm better preserves local structures and minimizes unwanted artifacts. Leveraging deep contextual features, we derive the proposed context-aware OT using the earth mover's distance and show that the proposed context-OT has a solid theoretical guarantee. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, as well as two downstream tasks.

Exploring diffusion models to enhance the generated images nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to delicately enrich plentiful details while preserving the visual appearance of key content in the original image. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely FreeEnhance, for content-consistent image enhancement using the off-the-shelf image diffusion models. Technically, FreeEnhance is a two-stage process that firstly adds random noise to the input image and then capitalizes on a pre-trained image diffusion model (i.e., Latent Diffusion Models) to denoise and enhance the image details. In the noising stage, FreeEnhance is devised to add lighter noise to the region with higher frequency to preserve the high-frequent patterns (e.g., edge, corner) in the original image. In the denoising stage, we present three target properties as constraints to regularize the predicted noise, enhancing images with high acutance and high visual quality. Extensive experiments conducted on the HPDv2 dataset demonstrate that our FreeEnhance outperforms the state-of-the-art image enhancement models in terms of quantitative metrics and human preference. More remarkably, FreeEnhance also shows higher human preference compared to the commercial image enhancement solution of Magnific AI.</p></details> | ACM Multimedia 2024 | None |

However, learning-based models are usually vulnerable to adversarial examples so as the UWIE models. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive study on the adversarial robustness of UWIE models, which indicates that UWIE models are potentially under the threat of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a general adversarial attack protocol. We make a first attempt to conduct adversarial attacks on five well-designed UWIE models on three common underwater image benchmark datasets. Considering the scattering and absorption of light in the underwater environment, there exists a strong correlation between color correction and underwater image enhancement. On the basis of that, we also design two effective UWIE-oriented adversarial attack methods Pixel Attack and Color Shift Attack targeting different color spaces. The results show that five models exhibit varying degrees of vulnerability to adversarial attacks and well-designed small perturbations on degraded images are capable of preventing UWIE models from generating enhanced results. Further, we conduct adversarial training on these models and successfully mitigated the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. In summary, we reveal the adversarial vulnerability of UWIE models and propose a new evaluation dimension of UWIE models.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite improvements through neural network-based approaches, these techniques falter under extremely low visibility conditions exacerbated by inhomogeneous illumination, which degrades deep learning performance due to inconsistent signal intensities. We introduce in this paper a novel method that adaptively filters background illumination based on Structural Differential and Integral Filtering (SDIF) to enhance only vital signal information. The grayscale banding is eliminated by incorporating a visual optimization strategy based on image gradients. Maximum Histogram Equalization (MHE) is used to achieve high contrast while maintaining fidelity to the original content. We evaluated our algorithm using data collected from both a fog chamber and outdoor environments, and performed comparative analyses with existing methods. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances signal clarity under extremely low visibility conditions and out-performs existing techniques, offering substantial improvements for deep fog imaging applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Prevailing underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods stick to straightforward feature modeling to learn the mapping function, which leads to limited vision gain as it lacks more explicit physical cues (e.g., depth). In this work, we investigate injecting the depth prior into the deep UIE model for more precise scene enhancement capability. To this end, we present a novel depth-guided perception UIE framework, dubbed underwater variable zoom (UVZ). Specifically, UVZ resorts to a two-stage pipeline. First, a depth estimation network is designed to generate critical depth maps, combined with an auxiliary supervision network introduced to suppress estimation differences during training. Second, UVZ parses near-far scenarios by harnessing the predicted depth maps, enabling local and non-local perceiving in different regions. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that UVZ achieves superior visual gain and delivers promising quantitative metrics. Besides, UVZ is confirmed to exhibit good generalization in some visual tasks, especially in unusual lighting conditions.

However, in the context of acquiring multiple views in the dark, the highly correlated views are seriously alienated, making it challenging to improve scene understanding with auxiliary views. Recent single image-based enhancement methods may not be able to provide consistently desirable restoration performance for all views due to the ignorance of potential feature correspondence among different views. To alleviate this issue, we make the first attempt to investigate multi-view low-light image enhancement. First, we construct a new dataset called Multi-View Low-light Triplets (MVLT), including 1,860 pairs of triple images with large illumination ranges and wide noise distribution. Each triplet is equipped with three different viewpoints towards the same scene. Second, we propose a deep multi-view enhancement framework based on the Recurrent Collaborative Network (RCNet). Specifically, in order to benefit from similar texture correspondence across different views, we design the recurrent feature enhancement, alignment and fusion (ReEAF) module, in which intra-view feature enhancement (Intra-view EN) followed by inter-view feature alignment and fusion (Inter-view AF) is performed to model the intra-view and inter-view feature propagation sequentially via multi-view collaboration. In addition, two different modules from enhancement to alignment (E2A) and from alignment to enhancement (A2E) are developed to enable the interactions between Intra-view EN and Inter-view AF, which explicitly utilize attentive feature weighting and sampling for enhancement and alignment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our RCNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

This continuity in scenes leads to extensive long-range correlations in spatial domains within remote sensing images. Convolutional Neural Networks, which rely on local correlations for long-distance modeling, struggle to establish long-range correlations in such images. On the other hand, transformer-based methods that focus on global information face high computational complexities when processing high-resolution remote sensing images. From another perspective, Fourier transform can compute global information without introducing a large number of parameters, enabling the network to more efficiently capture the overall image structure and establish long-range correlations. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network (DFFN) for low-light remote sensing image enhancement. Specifically, this challenging task of low-light enhancement is divided into two more manageable sub-tasks: the first phase learns amplitude information to restore image brightness, and the second phase learns phase information to refine details. To facilitate information exchange between the two phases, we designed an information fusion affine block that combines data from different phases and scales. Additionally, we have constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the current lack of datasets in dark light remote sensing image enhancement. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Leveraging the image Laplace decomposition scheme, we propose a novel low-frequency consistency method, facilitating improved frequency disentanglement optimization. Our method, seamlessly integrating with various models such as CNNs, Transformers, and flow-based and diffusion models, demonstrates remarkable adaptability. Noteworthy improvements are showcased across five popular benchmarks, with up to 7.68dB gains on PSNR achieved for six state-of-the-art models.

Postprocessing methods, such as image denoising, have been developed for image enhancement. However, the assessment of these enhanced images is challenging especially considering when there is a lack of high resolution and high signal images as reference, such as in sodium MRI. No-reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) metrics are approaches to solve this problem. Existing learning-based NR-IQA metrics rely on labels derived from subjective human opinions or metrics like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which are either time-consuming or lack accurate ground truths, resulting in unreliable assessment. We note that deep learning (DL) models have a unique characteristic in that they are specialized to a characteristic training set, meaning that deviations between the input testing data from the training data will reduce prediction accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel DL-based NR-IQA metric, the Model Specialization Metric (MSM), which does not depend on ground-truth images or labels. MSM measures the difference between the input image and the model's prediction for evaluating the quality of the input image. Experiments conducted on both simulated distorted proton T1-weighted MR images and denoised sodium MR images demonstrate that MSM exhibits a superior evaluation performance on various simulated noises and distortions. MSM also has a substantial agreement with the expert evaluations, achieving an averaged Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.6528, outperforming the existing NR-IQA metrics.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures | None |

Although radar sensors remain robust for operations under adverse weather conditions, their application in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is commonly limited by the low-resolution data they produce. The primary goal of this study is to enhance the radar images to better depict the details and features of the environment, thereby facilitating more accurate object identification in AVs. The proposed method utilizes high-resolution, two-dimensional (2D) projected light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds as ground truth images and low-resolution radar images as inputs to train the GAN. The ground truth images were obtained through two main steps. First, a LiDAR point cloud map was generated by accumulating raw LiDAR scans. Then, a customized LiDAR point cloud cropping and projection method was employed to obtain 2D projected LiDAR point clouds. The inference process of the proposed method relies solely on radar images to generate an enhanced version of them. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative results. These results show that the proposed method can generate enhanced images with clearer object representation compared to the input radar images, even under adverse weather conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Contrasting with conventional 2-D RGB imaging, 4-D LF imaging excels in capturing scenes from multiple perspectives, thereby indirectly embedding geometric information. This intrinsic property is anticipated to effectively address the challenges associated with underwater imaging. By leveraging both explicit and implicit depth cues present in 4-D LF images, we propose a progressive, mutually reinforcing framework for underwater 4-D LF image enhancement and depth estimation. Specifically, our framework explicitly utilizes estimated depth information alongside implicit depth-related dynamic convolutional kernels to modulate output features. The entire framework decomposes this complex task, iteratively optimizing the enhanced image and depth information to progressively achieve optimal enhancement results. More importantly, we construct the first 4-D LF-based underwater image dataset for quantitative evaluation and supervised training of learning-based methods, comprising 75 underwater scenes and 3675 high-resolution 2K pairs. To craft vibrant and varied underwater scenes, we build underwater environments with various objects and adopt several types of degradation. Through extensive experimentation, we showcase the potential and superiority of 4-D LF-based underwater imaging vis-a-vis traditional 2-D RGB-based approaches. Moreover, our method effectively corrects color bias and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised method based on latent mean-teacher and Gaussian process, named LMT-GP. We first design a latent mean-teacher framework that integrates both labeled and unlabeled data, as well as their latent vectors, into model training. Meanwhile, we use a mean-teacher-assisted Gaussian process learning strategy to establish a connection between the latent and pseudo-latent vectors obtained from the labeled and unlabeled data. To guide the learning process, we utilize an assisted Gaussian process regression (GPR) loss function. Furthermore, we design a pseudo-label adaptation module (PAM) to ensure the reliability of the network learning. To demonstrate our method's generalization ability and effectiveness, we apply it to multiple LLIE datasets and high-level vision tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves high generalization performance and image quality.

Recently, mamba-based methods have achieved promising results in image enhancement tasks. However, these methods commonly rely on Vmamba, which focuses only on spatial information modeling and struggles to deal with the cross-color channel dependency problem in underwater images caused by the differential attenuation of light wavelengths, limiting the effective use of deep networks. In this paper, we propose a novel UIE framework called O-mamba. O-mamba employs an O-shaped dual-branch network to separately model spatial and cross-channel information, utilizing the efficient global receptive field of state-space models optimized for underwater images. To enhance information interaction between the two branches and effectively utilize multi-scale information, we design a Multi-scale Bi-mutual Promotion Module. This branch includes MS-MoE for fusing multi-scale information within branches, Mutual Promotion module for interaction between spatial and channel information across branches, and Cyclic Multi-scale optimization strategy to maximize the use of multi-scale information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.The code is available at https://github.com/chenydong/O-Mamba.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/chenydong/O-Mamba) |

This paper makes endeavors in the direction of learning for low-light video enhancement without using paired ground truth. Compared to low-light image enhancement, enhancing low-light videos is more difficult due to the intertwined effects of noise, exposure, and contrast in the spatial domain, jointly with the need for temporal coherence. To address the above challenge, we propose the Unrolled Decomposed Unpaired Network (UDU-Net) for enhancing low-light videos by unrolling the optimization functions into a deep network to decompose the signal into spatial and temporal-related factors, which are updated iteratively. Firstly, we formulate low-light video enhancement as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation (MAP) problem with carefully designed spatial and temporal visual regularization. Then, via unrolling the problem, the optimization of the spatial and temporal constraints can be decomposed into different steps and updated in a stage-wise manner. From the spatial perspective, the designed Intra subnet leverages unpair prior information from expert photography retouched skills to adjust the statistical distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel mechanism that integrates human perception feedback to guide network optimization, suppressing over/under-exposure conditions. Meanwhile, to address the issue from the temporal perspective, the designed Inter subnet fully exploits temporal cues in progressive optimization, which helps achieve improved temporal consistency in enhancement results. Consequently, the proposed method achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in video illumination, noise suppression, and temporal consistency across outdoor and indoor scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike using predefined image editing filters, our framework utilizes learnable filters that acquire interpretable names through training. Our contribution is two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a novel filter architecture called an image-adaptive neural implicit lookup table, which uses a multilayer perceptron to implicitly define the transformation from input feature space to output color space. By incorporating image-adaptive parameters directly into the input features, we achieve highly expressive filters. Secondly, we introduce a prompt guidance loss to assign interpretable names to each filter. We evaluate visual impressions of enhancement results, such as exposure and contrast, using a vision and language model along with guiding prompts. We define a constraint to ensure that each filter affects only the targeted visual impression without influencing other attributes, which allows us to obtain the desired filter effects. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing predefined filter-based methods, thanks to the filters optimized to predict target results.

Therefore, the enhancement results produced by these methods are often unsatisfactory. In this context, there have been efforts to develop methods specifically for low-light stereo image enhancement. These methods take into account the cross-view disparities and enable interaction between the left and right views, leading to improved performance. However, these methods still do not fully exploit the interaction between left and right view information. To address this issue, we propose a model called Toward Sufficient Dual-View Interaction for Low-light Stereo Image Enhancement (SDI-Net). The backbone structure of SDI-Net is two encoder-decoder pairs, which are used to learn the mapping function from low-light images to normal-light images. Among the encoders and the decoders, we design a module named Cross-View Sufficient Interaction Module (CSIM), aiming to fully exploit the correlations between the binocular views via the attention mechanism. The quantitative and visual results on public datasets validate the superiority of our method over other related methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the key elements in our model.</p></details> |  | None |

Current learning-based approaches frequently lack explicit incorporation of prior knowledge about the physical processes involved in underwater image formation, resulting in limited optimization despite their impressive enhancement results. This paper proposes a novel deep unfolding network (DUN) for UIE that integrates color priors and inter-stage feature transformation to improve enhancement performance. The proposed DUN model combines the iterative optimization and reliability of model-based methods with the flexibility and representational power of deep learning, offering a more explainable and stable solution compared to existing learning-based UIE approaches. The proposed model consists of three key components: a Color Prior Guidance Block (CPGB) that establishes a mapping between color channels of degraded and original images, a Nonlinear Activation Gradient Descent Module (NAGDM) that simulates the underwater image degradation process, and an Inter Stage Feature Transformer (ISF-Former) that facilitates feature exchange between different network stages. By explicitly incorporating color priors and modeling the physical characteristics of underwater image formation, the proposed DUN model achieves more accurate and reliable enhancement results. Extensive experiments on multiple underwater image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The proposed DUN-based approach offers a promising solution for UIE, enabling more accurate and reliable scientific analysis in marine research.

Recent underwater image restoration (UIR) methods either analyze the input image at full resolution, resulting in spatial richness but contextual weakness, or progressively from high to low resolution, yielding reliable semantic information but reduced spatial accuracy. Here, we propose a lightweight multi-stage network called Lit-Net that focuses on multi-resolution and multi-scale image analysis for restoring underwater images while retaining original resolution during the first stage, refining features in the second, and focusing on reconstruction in the final stage. Our novel encoder block utilizes parallel $1\times1$ convolution layers to capture local information and speed up operations. Further, we incorporate a modified weighted color channel-specific $l_1$ loss ($cl_1$) function to recover color and detail information. Extensive experimentations on publicly available datasets suggest our model's superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvement in qualitative and quantitative measures, such as $29.477$ dB PSNR ($1.92\%$ improvement) and $0.851$ SSIM ($2.87\%$ improvement) on the EUVP dataset.

UHD images inherently possess high computational complexity, leading existing UHD LLIE methods to employ high-magnification downsampling to reduce computational costs, which in turn results in information loss. The wavelet transform not only allows downsampling without loss of information, but also separates the image content from the noise. It enables state space models (SSMs) to avoid being affected by noise when modeling long sequences, thus making full use of the long-sequence modeling capability of SSMs. On this basis, we propose Wave-Mamba, a novel approach based on two pivotal insights derived from the wavelet domain: 1) most of the content information of an image exists in the low-frequency component, less in the high-frequency component. 2) The high-frequency component exerts a minimal influence on the outcomes of low-light enhancement. Specifically, to efficiently model global content information on UHD images, we proposed a low-frequency state space block (LFSSBlock) by improving SSMs to focus on restoring the information of low-frequency sub-bands. Moreover, we propose a high-frequency enhance block (HFEBlock) for high-frequency sub-band information, which uses the enhanced low-frequency information to correct the high-frequency information and effectively restore the correct high-frequency details.

While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity with increasing image resolution presents significant efficiency challenges. Additionally, most supervised learning methods lack effective physical model constraint, which can lead to insufficient realism and overfitting in generated images. To address these issues, we propose a physical model constraint-based underwater image enhancement framework, Mamba-UIE. Specifically, we decompose the input image into four components: underwater scene radiance, direct transmission map, backscatter transmission map, and global background light. These components are reassembled according to the revised underwater image formation model, and the reconstruction consistency constraint is applied between the reconstructed image and the original image, thereby achieving effective physical constraint on the underwater image enhancement process. To tackle the quadratic computational complexity of Transformers when handling long sequences, we introduce the Mamba-UIE network based on linear complexity state space models. By incorporating the Mamba in Convolution block, long-range dependencies are modeled at both the channel and spatial levels, while the CNN backbone is retained to recover local features and details. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed Mamba-UIE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PSNR of 27.13 and an SSIM of 0.93 on the UIEB dataset.

Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance for various image processing tasks in terms of single-task conditions. However, they require to train separate models for different degradations and levels, which limits the generalization abilities of these models and restricts their applications in real-world. In this paper, we propose a text-induced unified image processor for low-level vision tasks, termed UniProcessor, which can effectively process various degradation types and levels, and support multimodal control. Specifically, our UniProcessor encodes degradation-specific information with the subject prompt and process degradations with the manipulation prompt. These context control features are injected into the UniProcessor backbone via cross-attention to control the processing procedure. For automatic subject-prompt generation, we further build a vision-language model for general-purpose low-level degradation perception via instruction tuning techniques. Our UniProcessor covers 30 degradation types, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniProcessor can well process these degradations without additional training or tuning and outperforms other competing methods. Moreover, with the help of degradation-aware context control, our UniProcessor first shows the ability to individually handle a single distortion in an image with multiple degradations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, ViTs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that may thwart the diagnosis process by leading it to intentional misclassification of critical disease. In this paper, we propose a novel image classification pipeline, namely, S-E Pipeline, that performs multiple pre-processing steps that allow ViT to be trained on critical features so as to reduce the impact of input perturbations by adversaries. Our method uses a combination of segmentation and image enhancement techniques such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Unsharp Masking (UM), and High-Frequency Emphasis filtering (HFE) as preprocessing steps to identify critical features that remain intact even after adversarial perturbations. The experimental study demonstrates that our novel pipeline helps in reducing the effect of adversarial attacks by 72.22% for the ViT-b32 model and 86.58% for the ViT-l32 model. Furthermore, we have shown an end-to-end deployment of our proposed method on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board to demonstrate its practical use case in modern hand-held devices that are usually resource-constrained.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AGLLDiff: Guiding Diffusion Models Towards Unsupervised Training-free Real-world Low-light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14900v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing low-light image enhancement (LIE) methods have achieved noteworthy success in solving synthetic distortions, yet they often fall short in practical applications. The limitations arise from two inherent challenges in real-world LIE: 1) the collection of distorted/clean image pairs is often impractical and sometimes even unavailable, and 2) accurately modeling complex degradations presents a non-trivial problem. To overcome them, we propose the Attribute Guidance Diffusion framework (AGLLDiff), a training-free method for effective real-world LIE. Instead of specifically defining the degradation process, AGLLDiff shifts the paradigm and models the desired attributes, such as image exposure, structure and color of normal-light images. These attributes are readily available and impose no assumptions about the degradation process, which guides the diffusion sampling process to a reliable high-quality solution space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current leading unsupervised LIE methods across benchmarks in terms of distortion-based and perceptual-based metrics, and it performs well even in sophisticated wild degradation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[ERD: Exponential Retinex decomposition based on weak space and hybrid nonconvex regularization and its denoising application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08498v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Retinex theory models the image as a product of illumination and reflection components, which has received extensive attention and is widely used in image enhancement, segmentation and color restoration. However, it has been rarely used in additive noise removal due to the inclusion of both multiplication and addition operations in the Retinex noisy image modeling. In this paper, we propose an exponential Retinex decomposition model based on hybrid non-convex regularization and weak space oscillation-modeling for image denoising. The proposed model utilizes non-convex first-order total variation (TV) and non-convex second-order TV to regularize the reflection component and the illumination component, respectively, and employs weak $H^{-1}$ norm to measure the residual component. By utilizing different regularizers, the proposed model effectively decomposes the image into reflection, illumination, and noise components. An alternating direction multipliers method (ADMM) combined with the Majorize-Minimization (MM) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. Furthermore, we provide a detailed proof of the convergence property of the algorithm. Numerical experiments validate both the proposed model and algorithm. Compared with several state-of-the-art denoising models, the proposed model exhibits superior performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean structural similarity (MSSIM).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAVE: Residual Vector Embedding for CLIP-Guided Backlit Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01889v3)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we propose a novel modification of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) guidance for the task of unsupervised backlit image enhancement. Our work builds on the state-of-the-art CLIP-LIT approach, which learns a prompt pair by constraining the text-image similarity between a prompt (negative/positive sample) and a corresponding image (backlit image/well-lit image) in the CLIP embedding space. Learned prompts then guide an image enhancement network. Based on the CLIP-LIT framework, we propose two novel methods for CLIP guidance. First, we show that instead of tuning prompts in the space of text embeddings, it is possible to directly tune their embeddings in the latent space without any loss in quality. This accelerates training and potentially enables the use of additional encoders that do not have a text encoder. Second, we propose a novel approach that does not require any prompt tuning. Instead, based on CLIP embeddings of backlit and well-lit images from training data, we compute the residual vector in the embedding space as a simple difference between the mean embeddings of the well-lit and backlit images. This vector then guides the enhancement network during training, pushing a backlit image towards the space of well-lit images. This approach further dramatically reduces training time, stabilizes training and produces high quality enhanced images without artifacts, both in supervised and unsupervised training regimes. Additionally, we show that residual vectors can be interpreted, revealing biases in training data, and thereby enabling potential bias correction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual High-Order Total Variation Model for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14868v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing, low-light image enhancement, and some high-level vision tasks.

| **[Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network for Single Image Deraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14292v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image deraining aims to improve the visibility of images damaged by rainy conditions, targeting the removal of degradation elements such as rain streaks, raindrops, and rain accumulation. While numerous single image deraining methods have shown promising results in image enhancement within the spatial domain, real-world rain degradation often causes uneven damage across an image's entire frequency spectrum, posing challenges for these methods in enhancing different frequency components. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network (AFENet) specifically for single image deraining that adaptively enhances images across various frequencies. We employ convolutions of different scales to adaptively decompose image frequency bands, introduce a feature enhancement module to boost the features of different frequency components and present a novel interaction module for interchanging and merging information from various frequency branches. Simultaneously, we propose a feature aggregation module that efficiently and adaptively fuses features from different frequency bands, facilitating enhancements across the entire frequency spectrum. This approach empowers the deraining network to eliminate diverse and complex rainy patterns and to reconstruct image details accurately. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method not only achieves visually appealing enhancement results but also surpasses existing methods in performance.</p></details> | 8pages | None |
| **[Unified-EGformer: Exposure Guided Lightweight Transformer for Mixed-Exposure Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13170v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent strides made by AI in image processing, the issue of mixed exposure, pivotal in many real-world scenarios like surveillance and photography, remains inadequately addressed. Traditional image enhancement techniques and current transformer models are limited with primary focus on either overexposure or underexposure. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified-Exposure Guided Transformer (Unified-EGformer). Our proposed solution is built upon advanced transformer architectures, equipped with local pixel-level refinement and global refinement blocks for color correction and image-wide adjustments. We employ a guided attention mechanism to precisely identify exposure-compromised regions, ensuring its adaptability across various real-world conditions. U-EGformer, with a lightweight design featuring a memory footprint (peak memory) of only $\sim$1134 MB (0.1 Million parameters) and an inference time of 95 ms (9.61x faster than the average), is a viable choice for real-time applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. Additionally, our model is highly generalizable, requiring minimal fine-tuning to handle multiple tasks and datasets with a single architecture.</p></details> | Under submission | None |
| **[Fast Context-Based Low-Light Image Enhancement via Neural Implicit Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12511v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current deep learning-based low-light image enhancement methods often struggle with high-resolution images, and fail to meet the practical demands of visual perception across diverse and unseen scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach termed CoLIE, which redefines the enhancement process through mapping the 2D coordinates of an underexposed image to its illumination component, conditioned on local context. We propose a reconstruction of enhanced-light images within the HSV space utilizing an implicit neural function combined with an embedded guided filter, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, we introduce a single image-based training loss function to enhance the model's adaptability to various scenes, further enhancing its practical applicability. Through rigorous evaluations, we analyze the properties of our proposed framework, demonstrating its superiority in both image quality and scene adaptability. Furthermore, our evaluation extends to applications in downstream tasks within low-light scenarios, underscoring the practical utility of CoLIE.

| **[GLARE: Low Light Image Enhancement via Generative Latent Feature based Codebook Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12431v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods either directly map Low-Light (LL) to Normal-Light (NL) images or use semantic or illumination maps as guides. However, the ill-posed nature of LLIE and the difficulty of semantic retrieval from impaired inputs limit these methods, especially in extremely low-light conditions. To address this issue, we present a new LLIE network via Generative LAtent feature based codebook REtrieval (GLARE), in which the codebook prior is derived from undegraded NL images using a Vector Quantization (VQ) strategy. More importantly, we develop a generative Invertible Latent Normalizing Flow (I-LNF) module to align the LL feature distribution to NL latent representations, guaranteeing the correct code retrieval in the codebook. In addition, a novel Adaptive Feature Transformation (AFT) module, featuring an adjustable function for users and comprising an Adaptive Mix-up Block (AMB) along with a dual-decoder architecture, is devised to further enhance fidelity while preserving the realistic details provided by codebook prior. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of GLARE on various benchmark datasets and real-world data. Its effectiveness as a preprocessing tool in low-light object detection tasks further validates GLARE for high-level vision applications.

| **[NamedCurves: Learned Image Enhancement via Color Naming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09892v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A popular method for enhancing images involves learning the style of a professional photo editor using pairs of training images comprised of the original input with the editor-enhanced version. When manipulating images, many editing tools offer a feature that allows the user to manipulate a limited selection of familiar colors. Editing by color name allows easy adjustment of elements like the "blue" of the sky or the "green" of trees. Inspired by this approach to color manipulation, we propose NamedCurves, a learning-based image enhancement technique that separates the image into a small set of named colors. Our method learns to globally adjust the image for each specific named color via tone curves and then combines the images using an attention-based fusion mechanism to mimic spatial editing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against several competing methods on the well-known Adobe 5K dataset and the PPR10K dataset, showing notable improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference on Computer Vision ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Taming Lookup Tables for Efficient Image Retouching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19238v2)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of high-definition screens in edge devices, such as end-user cameras, smartphones, and televisions, is spurring a significant demand for image enhancement. Existing enhancement models often optimize for high performance while falling short of reducing hardware inference time and power consumption, especially on edge devices with constrained computing and storage resources. To this end, we propose Image Color Enhancement Lookup Table (ICELUT) that adopts LUTs for extremely efficient edge inference, without any convolutional neural network (CNN). During training, we leverage pointwise (1x1) convolution to extract color information, alongside a split fully connected layer to incorporate global information. Both components are then seamlessly converted into LUTs for hardware-agnostic deployment. ICELUT achieves near-state-of-the-art performance and remarkably low power consumption. We observe that the pointwise network structure exhibits robust scalability, upkeeping the performance even with a heavily downsampled 32x32 input image. These enable ICELUT, the first-ever purely LUT-based image enhancer, to reach an unprecedented speed of 0.4ms on GPU and 7ms on CPU, at least one order faster than any CNN solution.

Specifically, we present a content-transfer decomposition network that performs Retinex decomposition within the latent space instead of image space as in previous approaches, enabling the encoded features of unpaired low-light and normal-light images to be decomposed into content-rich reflectance maps and content-free illumination maps. Subsequently, the reflectance map of the low-light image and the illumination map of the normal-light image are taken as input to the diffusion model for unsupervised restoration with the guidance of the low-light feature, where a self-constrained consistency loss is further proposed to eliminate the interference of normal-light content on the restored results to improve overall visual quality. Extensive experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks show that the proposed LightenDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised competitors and is comparable to supervised methods while being more generalizable to various scenes.

Low-light scenes pose two distinct challenges: information loss due to insufficient illumination and undesirable brightness shifts. Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) refers to image enhancement technology tailored to handle this scenario. We introduce CPGA-Net, an innovative LLIE network that combines dark/bright channel priors and gamma correction via deep learning and integrates features inspired by the Atmospheric Scattering Model and the Retinex Theory. This approach combines the use of traditional and deep learning methodologies, designed within a simple yet efficient architectural framework that focuses on essential feature extraction. The resulting CPGA-Net is a lightweight network with only 0.025 million parameters and 0.030 seconds for inference time, yet it achieves superior performance over existing LLIE methods on both objective and subjective evaluation criteria. Furthermore, we utilized knowledge distillation with explainable factors and proposed an efficient version that achieves 0.018 million parameters and 0.006 seconds for inference time. The proposed approaches inject new solution ideas into LLIE, providing practical applications in challenging low-light scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of an article submitted for consideration in [International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence] \c{opyright} [2024] [copyright World Scientific Publishing Company] [https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/ijprai]</p></details> | None |
