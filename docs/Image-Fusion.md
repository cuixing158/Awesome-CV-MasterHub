| **[A Text-Image Fusion Method with Data Augmentation Capabilities for Referring Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12482v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data, especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation. However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

| **[AngularFuse: A Closer Look at Angle-based Perception for Spatial-Sensitive Multi-Modality Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12260v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the first time, angle-based perception was introduced into the multi-modality image fusion task</p></details> | None |
| **[DDFusion:Degradation-Decoupled Fusion Framework for Robust Infrared and Visible Images Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10871v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional infrared and visible image fusion(IVIF) methods often assume high-quality inputs, neglecting real-world degradations such as low-light and noise, which limits their practical applicability. To address this, we propose a Degradation-Decoupled Fusion(DDFusion) framework, which achieves degradation decoupling and jointly models degradation suppression and image fusion in a unified manner. Specifically, the Degradation-Decoupled Optimization Network(DDON) performs degradation-specific decomposition to decouple inter-degradation and degradation-information components, followed by component-specific extraction paths for effective suppression of degradation and enhancement of informative features. The Interactive Local-Global Fusion Network (ILGFN) aggregates complementary features across multi-scale pathways and alleviates performance degradation caused by the decoupling between degradation optimization and image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDFusion achieves superior fusion performance under both clean and degraded conditions.

| **[Coupled Degradation Modeling and Fusion: A VLM-Guided Degradation-Coupled Network for Degradation-Aware Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11456v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques. This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression. Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor (SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios.

| **[SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07905v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

| **[UNIDOC-BENCH: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03663v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior work demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments.

| **[A Multi-Camera Vision-Based Approach for Fine-Grained Assembly Quality Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23815v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to facilitate further research in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Spatial-Spectral Binarized Neural Network for Panchromatic and Multi-spectral Images Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23321v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network (BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can attain a promising performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SSVIF: Self-Supervised Segmentation-Oriented Visible and Infrared Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22450v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However, compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gradient-based multi-focus image fusion with focus-aware saliency enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22392v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation. Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image, generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

| **[SMLNet: A SPD Manifold Learning Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10679v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Euclidean representation learning methods have achieved promising results in image fusion tasks, which can be attributed to their clear advantages in handling with linear space. However, data collected from a realistic scene usually has a non-Euclidean structure, evaluating the consistency of latent representations from paired views using Euclidean distance raises challenges. To address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SMLNet, which extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with human visual perception. The SPD matrix fundamentally underpins our network's learning process. Building upon this mathematical foundation, we employ a cross-modal fusion strategy to exploit modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information. To capture semantic similarity in images' intrinsic space, we further develop an attention module that meticulously processes the cross-modal semantic affinity matrix. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion network based on cross-modal manifold learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our framework exhibits superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Shaoyun2023.</p></details> | 23 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[Neurodynamics-Driven Coupled Neural P Systems for Multi-Focus Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17704v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is a crucial technique in image processing, with a key challenge being the generation of decision maps with precise boundaries. However, traditional methods based on heuristic rules and deep learning methods with black-box mechanisms are difficult to generate high-quality decision maps. To overcome this challenge, we introduce neurodynamics-driven coupled neural P (CNP) systems, which are third-generation neural computation models inspired by spiking mechanisms, to enhance the accuracy of decision maps. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the model's neurodynamics to identify the constraints between the network parameters and the input signals. This solid analysis avoids abnormal continuous firing of neurons and ensures the model accurately distinguishes between focused and unfocused regions, generating high-quality decision maps for MFIF. Based on this analysis, we propose a \textbf{N}eurodynamics-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{CNP} \textbf{F}usion model (\textbf{ND-CNPFuse}) tailored for the challenging MFIF task. Unlike current ideas of decision map generation, ND-CNPFuse distinguishes between focused and unfocused regions by mapping the source image into interpretable spike matrices. By comparing the number of spikes, an accurate decision map can be generated directly without any post-processing. Extensive experimental results show that ND-CNPFuse achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four classical MFIF datasets, including Lytro, MFFW, MFI-WHU, and Real-MFF. The code is available at https://github.com/MorvanLi/ND-CNPFuse.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/MorvanLi/ND-CNPFuse) |
| **[DescriptorMedSAM: Language-Image Fusion with Multi-Aspect Text Guidance for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13806v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate organ segmentation is essential for clinical tasks such as radiotherapy planning and disease monitoring. Recent foundation models like MedSAM achieve strong results using point or bounding-box prompts but still require manual interaction. We propose DescriptorMedSAM, a lightweight extension of MedSAM that incorporates structured text prompts, ranging from simple organ names to combined shape and location descriptors to enable click-free segmentation. DescriptorMedSAM employs a CLIP text encoder to convert radiology-style descriptors into dense embeddings, which are fused with visual tokens via a cross-attention block and a multi-scale feature extractor. We designed four descriptor types: Name (N), Name + Shape (NS), Name + Location (NL), and Name + Shape + Location (NSL), and evaluated them on the FLARE 2022 dataset under zero-shot and few-shot settings, where organs unseen during training must be segmented with minimal additional data. NSL prompts achieved the highest performance, with a Dice score of 0.9405 under full supervision, a 76.31% zero-shot retention ratio, and a 97.02% retention ratio after fine-tuning with only 50 labeled slices per unseen organ. Adding shape and location cues consistently improved segmentation accuracy, especially for small or morphologically complex structures. We demonstrate that structured language prompts can effectively replace spatial interactions, delivering strong zero-shot performance and rapid few-shot adaptation. By quantifying the role of descriptor, this work lays the groundwork for scalable, prompt-aware segmentation models that generalize across diverse anatomical targets with minimal annotation effort.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Rectified Flow for Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16549v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion is a fundamental and important task in computer vision, aiming to combine complementary information from different modalities to fuse images. In recent years, diffusion models have made significant developments in the field of image fusion. However, diffusion models often require complex computations and redundant inference time, which reduces the applicability of these methods. To address this issue, we propose RFfusion, an efficient one-step diffusion model for image fusion based on Rectified Flow. We incorporate Rectified Flow into the image fusion task to straighten the sampling path in the diffusion model, achieving one-step sampling without the need for additional training, while still maintaining high-quality fusion results. Furthermore, we propose a task-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture tailored for image fusion, where the fusion operation is embedded within the latent space to further reduce computational complexity. To address the inherent discrepancy between conventional reconstruction-oriented VAE objectives and the requirements of image fusion, we introduce a two-stage training strategy. This approach facilitates the effective learning and integration of complementary information from multi-modal source images, thereby enabling the model to retain fine-grained structural details while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both inference speed and fusion quality.

| **[MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12901v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast, and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images. Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities, attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities, attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RIS-FUSION: Rethinking Text-Driven Infrared and Visible Image Fusion from the Perspective of Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12710v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective: highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU.

Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks such as object detection and scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 6th International Conference on Computer Vision and Data Mining (ICCVDM 2025)</p></details> | None |

While compressive sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation (TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images, which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse reconstruction scenarios.

| **[FlexiD-Fuse: Flexible number of inputs multi-modal medical image fusion based on diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09456v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FS-Diff: Semantic guidance and clarity-aware simultaneous multimodal image fusion and super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09427v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions, the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted, with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images. Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics in the fused images.

| **[Dual Interaction Network with Cross-Image Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05953v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively.

This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion), a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs) for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features. Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities. Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices.

Recent studies have begun incorporating downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |

To address this limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19 employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal consistency of the generated fused videos.

Although less studies have attempted to incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response, we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions, designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this, the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues, thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks.

It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning. AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high- and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes, enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components, AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features, reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF) -- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between performance and efficiency.

To alleviate these issues, we propose a semantic structure-preserving fusion approach for MMIF, namely SSPFusion. At first, we design a structural feature extractor (SFE) to extract the prominent structural features from multiple input images. Concurrently, we introduce a transformation function with Sobel operator to generate self-supervised structural signals in these extracted features. Subsequently, we design a multi-scale structure-preserving fusion (SPF) module, guided by the generated structural signals, to merge the structural features of input images. This process ensures the preservation of semantic structure consistency between the resultant fusion image and the input images. Through the synergy of these two robust modules of SFE and SPF, our method can generate high-quality fusion images and demonstrate good generalization ability. Experimental results, on both infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion tasks, demonstrate that our method outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Capturing both the unique and complementary information across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method, MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network (IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities. To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning, addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.

Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images. To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion.

However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight.

Accurate image registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However, existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both image alignment and fusion.

In this paper, we first propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors to represent the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training. Experiments show that our method can obtain much better fusion results than existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Residual Prior-driven Frequency-aware Network for Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06735v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM) extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM) enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information. Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the high-level vision task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Capturing Stable HDR Videos Using a Dual-Camera System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06593v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue, we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation. To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork, which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS) |

Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation, and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes, and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional frame-based low-light enhancement methods often amplify noise or fail to preserve structural details, especially in real-world scenarios. Event cameras, offering high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution by asynchronously capturing brightness changes, emerge as promising alternatives for low-light imaging. However, existing event-image fusion methods suffer from simplistic fusion strategies and inadequate handling of spatial-temporal misalignment and noise. To address these challenges, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing. Our approach incorporates a Cross-RWKV module, leveraging the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture for fine-grained temporal and cross-modal fusion, and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module, which jointly performs adaptive frequency-domain noise suppression and spatial-domain deformable convolution alignment. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on real-world low-light datasets(SDE, SDSD, RELED) demonstrate that EvRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively enhancing image quality by suppressing noise, restoring structural details, and improving visual clarity in challenging low-light conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block (DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions, which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared (IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba (DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more discriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show that our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.

Its effectiveness heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module, incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and significant advantages over existing approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | None |

Despite advancements, current models often struggle with segmenting densely packed elements due to a lack of comprehensive fusion features for guidance during training. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) allows precise control during fine-tuning through its flexible prompting encoder, its potential remains largely unexplored in the context of multimodal segmentation for natural images. In this paper, we introduce SAM into multimodal image segmentation for the first time, proposing a novel framework that combines Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) modules. This approach transforms the training methodology for multimodal segmentation from a traditional black-box approach to a controllable, prompt-based mechanism. Specifically, we obtain latent space features for both modalities through vector quantization and embed them into a cross-attention-based inter-domain fusion module to establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We then use these comprehensive fusion features as prompts to guide precise pixel-level segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SAM and SAM2 in multimodal autonomous driving scenarios, achieving an average improvement of 4.1$\%$ over the state-of-the-art method in segmentation mIoU, and the performance is also optimized in other multi-modal visual scenes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[S4Fusion: Saliency-aware Selective State Space Model for Infrared Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20881v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the tasks in Image Fusion, Infrared and Visible Image Fusion aims to integrate complementary information captured by sensors of different modalities into a single image. The Selective State Space Model (SSSM), known for its ability to capture long-range dependencies, has demonstrated its potential in the field of computer vision. However, in image fusion, current methods underestimate the potential of SSSM in capturing the global spatial information of both modalities. This limitation prevents the simultaneous consideration of the global spatial information from both modalities during interaction, leading to a lack of comprehensive perception of salient targets. Consequently, the fusion results tend to bias towards one modality instead of adaptively preserving salient targets. To address this issue, we propose the Saliency-aware Selective State Space Fusion Model (S4Fusion). In our S4Fusion, the designed Cross-Modal Spatial Awareness Module (CMSA) can simultaneously focus on global spatial information from both modalities while facilitating their interaction, thereby comprehensively capturing complementary information. Additionally, S4Fusion leverages a pre-trained network to perceive uncertainty in the fused images. By minimizing this uncertainty, S4Fusion adaptively highlights salient targets from both images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality images and enhances performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

The study focuses on crop cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values, atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in irrigated agricultural regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in Earth Systems and Environment</p></details> | None |

In particular, numerous advanced methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020 benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy, offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

This paper proposes an image fusion method based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs, and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics, producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich information without the necessity for a training dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges.

However, in practice, the source images are often located in a non-Euclidean space, where the Euclidean methods usually cannot encapsulate the intrinsic topological structure. Typically, the inner product performed in the Euclidean space calculates the algebraic similarity rather than the semantic similarity, which results in undesired attention output and a decrease in fusion performance. While the balance of low-level details and high-level semantics should be considered in infrared and visible image fusion task. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Grassmann manifold for infrared and visible image fusion (GrFormer). Specifically, our method constructs a low-rank subspace mapping through projection constraints on the Grassmann manifold, compressing attention features into subspaces of varying rank levels. This forces the features to decouple into high-frequency details (local low-rank) and low-frequency semantics (global low-rank), thereby achieving multi-scale semantic fusion. Additionally, to effectively integrate the significant information, we develop a cross-modal fusion strategy (CMS) based on a covariance mask to maximise the complementary properties between different modalities and to suppress the features with high correlation, which are deemed redundant. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms SOTA methods both qualitatively and quantitatively on multiple image fusion benchmarks.

Existing deep learning approaches often utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.

To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift. Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation.

Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention, but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders progress. To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in downstream evaluation. Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially in low-light and occluded scenes.

While spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution, spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual connections.

However, conventional optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is hindered by a limited depth-of-field (DoF) due to the narrow depth range focused on a Gaussian beam. Consequently, it fails to resolve sufficient details in the depth direction. Herein, we propose a decision-level constrained end-to-end multi-focus image fusion (Dc-EEMF) to push DoF limit of PAM. The DC-EEMF method is a lightweight siamese network that incorporates an artifact-resistant channel-wise spatial frequency as its feature fusion rule. The meticulously crafted U-Net-based perceptual loss function for decision-level focus properties in end-to-end fusion seamlessly integrates the complementary advantages of spatial domain and transform domain methods within Dc-EEMF. This approach can be trained end-to-end without necessitating post-processing procedures. Experimental results and numerical analyses collectively demonstrate our method's robust performance, achieving an impressive fusion result for PAM images without a substantial sacrifice in lateral resolution. The utilization of Dc-EEMF-powered PAM has the potential to serve as a practical tool in preclinical and clinical studies requiring extended DoF for various applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods primarily rely on the stacking and design of network architectures to enhance the fusion performance, often ignoring the impact of dataset scene bias on model training. This oversight leads the model to learn spurious correlations between specific scenes and fusion weights under conventional likelihood estimation framework, thereby limiting fusion performance. To solve the above problems, this paper first re-examines the image fusion task from the causality perspective, and disentangles the model from the impact of bias by constructing a tailored causal graph to clarify the causalities among the variables in image fusion task. Then, the Back-door Adjustment based Feature Fusion Module (BAFFM) is proposed to eliminate confounder interference and enable the model to learn the true causal effect. Finally, Extensive experiments on three standard datasets prove that the proposed method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in infrared and visible image fusion.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose Unified Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel framework for temporally coherent video fusion that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality, well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks on VF-Bench. Project page: https://vfbench.github.io.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods mainly follow computer vision standards for feature extraction and fusion strategy formulation, overlooking the rich semantic information inherent in medical images. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic-guided medical image fusion approach that, for the first time, incorporates medical prior knowledge into the fusion process. Specifically, we construct a publicly available multimodal medical image-text dataset, upon which text descriptions generated by BiomedGPT are encoded and semantically aligned with image features in a high-dimensional space via a semantic interaction alignment module. During this process, a cross attention based linear transformation automatically maps the relationship between textual and visual features to facilitate comprehensive learning. The aligned features are then embedded into a text-injection module for further feature-level fusion. Unlike traditional methods, we further generate diagnostic reports from the fused images to assess the preservation of medical information. Additionally, we design a medical semantic loss function to enhance the retention of textual cues from the source images. Experimental results on test datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while preserving more critical medical information.</p></details> |  | None |

Most deep learning-based methods for HSI-MSI fusion rely on large amounts of hyperspectral data for supervised training, which is often scarce in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a self-learning Adaptive Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model (ARGS-Diff), which only utilizes the observed images without any extra training data. Specifically, as the LR-HSI contains spectral information and the HR-MSI contains spatial information, we design two lightweight spectral and spatial diffusion models to separately learn the spectral and spatial distributions from them. Then, we use these two models to reconstruct HR-HSI from two low-dimensional components, i.e, the spectral basis and the reduced coefficient, during the reverse diffusion process. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Residual Guided Module (ARGM), which refines the two components through a residual guided function at each sampling step, thereby stabilizing the sampling process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ARGS-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency in the field of HSI-MSI fusion.

To address the lack of ground truth in current multi-modal image registration and fusion methods, we propose a novel self-supervised \textbf{B}i-directional \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{R}egistration framework (\textbf{B-SR}). Specifically, B-SR utilizes a proxy data generator (PDG) and an inverse proxy data generator (IPDG) to achieve self-supervised global-local registration. Visible-infrared image pairs with spatially misaligned differences are aligned to obtain global differences through the registration module. The same image pairs are processed by PDG, such as cropping, flipping, stitching, etc., and then aligned to obtain local differences. IPDG converts the obtained local differences into pseudo-global differences, which are used to perform global-local difference consistency with the global differences. Furthermore, aiming at eliminating the effect of modal gaps on the registration module, we design a neighborhood dynamic alignment loss to achieve cross-modal image edge alignment. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in multi-modal image alignment and fusion against the competing methods.

Traditional VIF methods primarily focus on generating fused images with high visual quality, while recent advancements increasingly emphasize incorporating semantic information into the fusion model during training. However, most existing segmentation-oriented VIF methods adopt a cascade structure comprising separate fusion and segmentation models, leading to increased network complexity and redundancy. This raises a critical question: can we design a more concise and efficient structure to integrate semantic information directly into the fusion model during training-Inspired by multi-task learning, we propose a concise and universal training framework, MultiTaskVIF, for segmentation-oriented VIF models. In this framework, we introduce a multi-task head decoder (MTH) to simultaneously output both the fused image and the segmentation result during training. Unlike previous cascade training frameworks that necessitate joint training with a complete segmentation model, MultiTaskVIF enables the fusion model to learn semantic features by simply replacing its decoder with MTH. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when faced with severe illumination degradation in visible images, the fusion results of existing image fusion methods often exhibit blurry and dim visual effects, posing major challenges for autonomous driving. To this end, a Darkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image disentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded multi-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training (enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss caused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a latent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the cascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised to acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper cross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve texture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is designed to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more informative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark environments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB PSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision tasks.

In this paper, we propose HunyuanCustom, a multi-modal customized video generation framework that emphasizes subject consistency while supporting image, audio, video, and text conditions. Built upon HunyuanVideo, our model first addresses the image-text conditioned generation task by introducing a text-image fusion module based on LLaVA for enhanced multi-modal understanding, along with an image ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation to reinforce identity features across frames. To enable audio- and video-conditioned generation, we further propose modality-specific condition injection mechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial cross-attention, and a video-driven injection module that integrates latent-compressed conditional video through a patchify-based feature-alignment network. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-subject scenarios demonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open- and closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video alignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks, including audio and video-driven customized video generation. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multi-modal conditioning and identity-preserving strategies in advancing controllable video generation.

Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory.

Compared with single images, the sequence relationships in multi-modal and multi-view fundus images contain long-range dependencies in lesion features. By modeling the long-range dependencies in these sequences, lesion areas can be more comprehensively mined, and modality-specific lesions can be detected. To learn the long-range dependency relationship and fuse complementary multi-scale lesion features between different fundus modalities, we design a multi-modal fundus image fusion method based on multi-scale cross-attention, which solves the static receptive field problem in previous multi-modal medical fusion methods based on attention. To capture multi-view relative positional relationships between different views and fuse comprehensive lesion features between different views, we design a multi-view fundus image fusion method based on shifted window self-attention, which also solves the computational complexity of the multi-view fundus fusion method based on self-attention is quadratic to the size and number of multi-view fundus images. Finally, we design a multi-task retinopathy diagnosis framework to help ophthalmologists reduce workload and improve diagnostic accuracy by combining the proposed two fusion methods.

However, unlike previous studies, this paper utilizes Granular Ball adaptation to extract features in the brightness space as priors for deep networks, enabling the fusion network to converge quickly and complete the fusion task. This leads to few-shot training for a general image fusion network, and based on this, we propose the GBFF fusion method. According to the information expression division of pixel pairs in the original fused image, we classify pixel pairs with significant performance as the positive domain and non-significant pixel pairs as the boundary domain. We perform split inference in the brightness space using Granular Ball adaptation to compute weights for pixels that express information to varying degrees, generating approximate supervision images that provide priors for the neural network in the structural brightness space. Additionally, the extracted global saliency features also adaptively provide priors for setting the loss function weights of each image in the network, guiding the network to converge quickly at both global and pixel levels alongside the supervised images, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of the fused images. Each modality only used 10 pairs of images as the training set, completing the fusion task with a limited number of iterations. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the algorithm and theory, and qualitative and quantitative comparisons with SOTA methods show that this approach is highly competitive in terms of fusion time and image expressiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose an iterative human-in-the-loop data generation pipeline, which leverages limited initial data with diverse textual prompts to generate fusion datasets across various scenarios and interactions, including placement, holding, wearing, and style transfer. Building on this, we introduce DreamFuse, a novel approach based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model, to generate consistent and harmonious fused images with both foreground and background information. DreamFuse employs a Positional Affine mechanism to inject the size and position of the foreground into the background, enabling effective foreground-background interaction through shared attention. Furthermore, we apply Localized Direct Preference Optimization guided by human feedback to refine DreamFuse, enhancing background consistency and foreground harmony. DreamFuse achieves harmonious fusion while generalizing to text-driven attribute editing of the fused results.

Accurately predicting final moisture content (MC) is critically needed for quality control of drying processes. State-of-the-art methods can build deterministic relationships between process parameters and MC, but cannot adequately account for inherent process variabilities that are ubiquitous in fruit drying.

The proposed modeling architecture permits flexible adjustment of information portion from tabular and image data modalities. Experimental validation shows that the multi-modal approach improves predictive accuracy substantially compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method reduces root-mean-squared errors by 19.3%, 24.2%, and 15.2% over tabular-only, image-only, and standard tabular-image fusion models, respectively.

Traditional approaches, such as CNNs and GANs, offer efficiency but struggle to handle low-quality or complex inputs. Recent advances in text-guided methods leverage large model priors to overcome these limitations, but at the cost of significant computational overhead, both in memory and inference time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for distilling large model priors, eliminating the need for text guidance during inference while dramatically reducing model size. Our framework utilizes a teacher-student architecture, where the teacher network incorporates large model priors and transfers this knowledge to a smaller student network via a tailored distillation process. Additionally, we introduce spatial-channel cross-fusion module to enhance the model's ability to leverage textual priors across both spatial and channel dimensions. Our method achieves a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and fusion quality.

| **[Robust Fusion Controller: Degradation-aware Image Fusion with Fine-grained Language Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05795v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current image fusion methods struggle to adapt to real-world environments encompassing diverse degradations with spatially varying characteristics. To address this challenge, we propose a robust fusion controller (RFC) capable of achieving degradation-aware image fusion through fine-grained language instructions, ensuring its reliable application in adverse environments. Specifically, RFC first parses language instructions to innovatively derive the functional condition and the spatial condition, where the former specifies the degradation type to remove, while the latter defines its spatial coverage. Then, a composite control priori is generated through a multi-condition coupling network, achieving a seamless transition from abstract language instructions to latent control variables. Subsequently, we design a hybrid attention-based fusion network to aggregate multi-modal information, in which the obtained composite control priori is deeply embedded to linearly modulate the intermediate fused features. To ensure the alignment between language instructions and control outcomes, we introduce a novel language-feature alignment loss, which constrains the consistency between feature-level gains and the composite control priori. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our RFC is robust against various composite degradations, particularly in highly challenging flare scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we developed \textit{Respiratory Differencing}, a novel intraoperative CT image assistance system aimed at improving ablation evaluation. The system first segments tumor regions in preoperative CT images and then employs a multi-stage registration process to align these images with corresponding intraoperative or postoperative images, compensating for respiratory deformations and treatment-induced changes. This system provides two key outputs to help physicians evaluate intraoperative ablation. First, differential images are generated by subtracting the registered preoperative images from the intraoperative ones, allowing direct visualization and quantitative comparison of pre- and post-treatment differences. These differential images enable physicians to assess the relative positions of the tumor and ablation zones, even when the tumor is no longer visible in post-ablation images, thus improving the subjective evaluation of ablation effectiveness. Second, the system provides a quantitative metric that measures the discrepancies between the tumor area and the treatment zone, offering a numerical assessment of the overall efficacy of ablation.This pioneering system compensates for complex lung deformations and integrates pre- and intra-operative imaging data, enhancing quality control in cancer ablation treatments. A follow-up study involving 35 clinical cases demonstrated that our system significantly outperforms traditional subjective assessments in identifying under-ablation cases during or immediately after treatment, highlighting its potential to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

While treating all fusion tasks as a unified problem facilitates task-invariant knowledge sharing, it often overlooks task-specific characteristics, thereby limiting the overall performance. Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task identification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks. However, this dependence during inference restricts the model's generalization to unseen fusion tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified image fusion framework named "TITA", which dynamically balances both Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation. For task-invariant interaction, we introduce the Interaction-enhanced Pixel Attention (IPA) module to enhance pixel-wise interactions for better multi-source complementary information extraction. For task-specific adaptation, the Operation-based Adaptive Fusion (OAF) module dynamically adjusts operation weights based on task properties. Additionally, we incorporate the Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization (FAMO) strategy to mitigate the impact of gradient conflicts across tasks during joint training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TITA not only achieves competitive performance compared to specialized methods across three image fusion scenarios but also exhibits strong generalization to unseen fusion tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In response to these challenges, we propose a controllable image fusion framework with language-vision prompts, termed ControlFusion, which adaptively neutralizes composite degradations. On the one hand, we develop a degraded imaging model that integrates physical imaging mechanisms, including the Retinex theory and atmospheric scattering principle, to simulate composite degradations, thereby providing potential for addressing real-world complex degradations from the data level. On the other hand, we devise a prompt-modulated restoration and fusion network that dynamically enhances features with degradation prompts, enabling our method to accommodate composite degradation of varying levels. Specifically, considering individual variations in quality perception of users, we incorporate a text encoder to embed user-specified degradation types and severity levels as degradation prompts. We also design a spatial-frequency collaborative visual adapter that autonomously perceives degradations in source images, thus eliminating the complete dependence on user instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ControlFusion outperforms SOTA fusion methods in fusion quality and degradation handling, particularly in countering real-world and compound degradations with various levels.</p></details> |  | None |

This work presents a \textbf{D}egradation and \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{P}rior dual-guided framework for degraded image \textbf{Fusion} (\textbf{DSPFusion}), utilizing degradation priors and high-quality scene semantic priors restored via diffusion models to guide both information recovery and fusion in a unified model. In specific, it first individually extracts modality-specific degradation priors, while jointly capturing comprehensive low-quality semantic priors. Subsequently, a diffusion model is developed to iteratively restore high-quality semantic priors in a compact latent space, enabling our method to be over $20 \times$ faster than mainstream diffusion model-based image fusion schemes. Finally, the degradation priors and high-quality semantic priors are employed to guide information enhancement and aggregation via the dual-prior guidance and prior-guided fusion modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSPFusion mitigates most typical degradations while integrating complementary context with minimal computational cost, greatly broadening the application scope of image fusion.</p></details> |  | None |

Current work has demonstrated the increased accuracy of neural photogrammetry for surface reconstruction from optical satellite images compared to algorithmic methods. Common satellites produce both a panchromatic and multispectral image, which contain high spatial and spectral information respectively. Current neural reconstruction methods require multispectral images to be upsampled with a pansharpening method using the spatial data in the panchromatic image. However, these methods may introduce biases and hallucinations due to domain gaps. FusionRF introduces joint image fusion during optimization through a novel cross-resolution kernel that learns to resolve spatial resolution loss present in multispectral images. As input, FusionRF accepts the original multispectral and panchromatic data, eliminating the need for image preprocessing. FusionRF also leverages multimodal appearance embeddings that encode the image characteristics of each modality and view within a uniform representation. By optimizing on both modalities, FusionRF learns to fuse image modalities while performing reconstruction tasks and eliminates the need for a pansharpening preprocessing step. We evaluate our method on multispectral and panchromatic satellite images from the WorldView-3 satellite in various locations, and show that FusionRF provides an average of 17% improvement in depth reconstruction accuracy, and renders sharp training and novel views.</p></details> |  | None |

Until now, vision-based tactile sensors such as DIGIT and GelSight have been using a single, static pattern of structured light tuned to the specific form factor of the sensor. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of dynamic illumination patterns, in conjunction with image fusion techniques, to improve the quality of sensing of vision-based tactile sensors. Specifically, we propose to capture multiple measurements, each with a different illumination pattern, and then fuse them together to obtain a single, higher-quality measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that this type of dynamic illumination yields significant improvements in image contrast, sharpness, and background difference. This discovery opens the possibility of retroactively improving the sensing quality of existing vision-based tactile sensors with a simple software update, and for new hardware designs capable of fully exploiting dynamic illumination.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The recently developed text-guided SR approaches leverage textual descriptions to enhance their detail restoration capabilities but frequently struggle with effectively performing alignment, resulting in semantic inconsistencies. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal semantic enhancement framework that integrates textual semantics with visual features, effectively mitigating semantic mismatches and detail losses in highly degraded low-resolution (LR) images. Our method enables realistic, high-quality SR to be performed at large upscaling factors, with a maximum scaling ratio of 16$\times$. The framework integrates both text and image inputs using the prompt predictor, the Text-Image Fusion Block (TIFBlock), and the Iterative Refinement Module, leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) features to guide a progressive enhancement process with fine-grained alignment. This synergy produces high-resolution outputs with sharp textures and strong semantic coherence, even at substantial scaling factors. Extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, by leveraging textual semantics, our method offers a degree of super-resolution editability, allowing for controlled enhancements while preserving semantic consistency.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures | None |

Although early research prioritized visual quality, preserving fine details and adapting to downstream tasks remains challenging. Recent approaches attempt task-specific design but rarely achieve "The Best of Both Worlds" due to inconsistent optimization goals. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that leverages the semantic knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to Grow the quality of fusion results and Enable downstream task adaptability, namely SAGE. Specifically, we design a Semantic Persistent Attention (SPA) Module that efficiently maintains source information via the persistent repository while extracting high-level semantic priors from SAM. More importantly, to eliminate the impractical dependence on SAM during inference, we introduce a bi-level optimization-driven distillation mechanism with triplet losses, which allow the student network to effectively extract knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a balance between high-quality visual results and downstream task adaptability while maintaining practical deployment efficiency.

The introduction of near-infrared (NIR) images offers new possibilities for RGB image denoising. However, due to the inconsistency between NIR and RGB images, the existing works still struggle to balance the contributions of two fields in the process of image fusion. In response to this, in this paper, we develop a cross-field Frequency Correlation Exploiting Network (FCENet) for NIR-assisted image denoising. We first propose the frequency correlation prior based on an in-depth statistical frequency analysis of NIR-RGB image pairs. The prior reveals the complementary correlation of NIR and RGB images in the frequency domain. Leveraging frequency correlation prior, we then establish a frequency learning framework composed of Frequency Dynamic Selection Mechanism (FDSM) and Frequency Exhaustive Fusion Mechanism (FEFM). FDSM dynamically selects complementary information from NIR and RGB images in the frequency domain, and FEFM strengthens the control of common and differential features during the fusion process of NIR and RGB features. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data validate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing fusion methods struggle to balance these two factors. Achieving high quality in fused images may result in lower performance in downstream visual tasks, and vice versa. To address this drawback, a novel LVM (large vision model)-guided fusion framework with Object-aware and Contextual COntrastive learning is proposed, termed as OCCO. The pre-trained LVM is utilized to provide semantic guidance, allowing the network to focus solely on fusion tasks while emphasizing learning salient semantic features in form of contrastive learning. Additionally, a novel feature interaction fusion network is also designed to resolve information conflicts in fusion images caused by modality differences. By learning the distinction between positive samples and negative samples in the latent feature space (contextual space), the integrity of target information in fused image is improved, thereby benefiting downstream performance. Finally, compared with eight state-of-the-art methods on four datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated, and exceptional performance is also demonstrated on downstream visual task.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, the diffusion model, which demonstrates unprecedented generative potential, has been explored in image fusion. However, these approaches typically incorporate predefined multimodal guidance into diffusion, failing to capture the dynamically changing significance of each modality, while lacking theoretical guarantees. To address this issue, we reveal a significant spatio-temporal imbalance in image denoising; specifically, the diffusion model produces dynamic information gains in different image regions with denoising steps. Based on this observation, we Dig into the Diffusion Information Gains (Dig2DIG) and theoretically derive a diffusion-based dynamic image fusion framework that provably reduces the upper bound of the generalization error. Accordingly, we introduce diffusion information gains (DIG) to quantify the information contribution of each modality at different denoising steps, thereby providing dynamic guidance during the fusion process. Extensive experiments on multiple fusion scenarios confirm that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches in terms of both fusion quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current fusion methods for downstream tasks still use predefined fusion objectives that potentially mismatch the downstream tasks, limiting adaptive guidance and reducing model flexibility. To address this, we propose Task-driven Image Fusion (TDFusion), a fusion framework incorporating a learnable fusion loss guided by task loss. Specifically, our fusion loss includes learnable parameters modeled by a neural network called the loss generation module. This module is supervised by the downstream task loss in a meta-learning manner. The learning objective is to minimize the task loss of fused images after optimizing the fusion module with the fusion loss. Iterative updates between the fusion module and the loss module ensure that the fusion network evolves toward minimizing task loss, guiding the fusion process toward the task objectives. TDFusion's training relies entirely on the downstream task loss, making it adaptable to any specific task. It can be applied to any architecture of fusion and task networks. Experiments demonstrate TDFusion's performance through fusion experiments conducted on four different datasets, in addition to evaluations on semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Specifically, we introduce Wavelet-SSM module, which incorporates wavelet-based frequency domain feature extraction and global information extraction through SSM, thereby effectively capturing both global and local features. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal feature attention modulation, which facilitates efficient interaction and fusion between different modalities.

Existing approaches typically treat image fusion and subsequent high-level tasks as separate processes, resulting in fused images that offer only marginal gains in task performance and fail to provide constructive feedback for optimizing the fusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Discriminative Cross-Dimension Evolutionary Learning Framework, termed DCEvo, which simultaneously enhances visual quality and perception accuracy. Leveraging the robust search capabilities of Evolutionary Learning, our approach formulates the optimization of dual tasks as a multi-objective problem by employing an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to dynamically balance loss function parameters. Inspired by visual neuroscience, we integrate a Discriminative Enhancer (DE) within both the encoder and decoder, enabling the effective learning of complementary features from different modalities. Additionally, our Cross-Dimensional Embedding (CDE) block facilitates mutual enhancement between high-dimensional task features and low-dimensional fusion features, ensuring a cohesive and efficient feature integration process. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 9.32% in visual quality while also enhancing subsequent high-level tasks.

Multiview lightsheet microscopy improves 3-D resolution by combining multiple views but simultaneously increasing the complexity and the photon budget, leading to potential photobleaching and phototoxicity. The FuseMyCells challenge, organized in conjunction with the IEEE ISBI 2025 conference, aims to benchmark deep learning-based solutions for fusing high-quality 3-D volumes from single 3-D views, potentially simplifying procedures and conserving the photon budget. In this work, we propose a contribution to the FuseMyCells challenge based on a two-step procedure. The first step processes a downsampled version of the image to capture the entire region of interest, while the second step uses a patch-based approach for high-resolution inference, incorporating adversarial loss to enhance visual outcomes. This method addresses challenges related to high data resolution, the necessity of global context, and the preservation of high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to improve 3-D image fusion quality and extend the capabilities of lightsheet microscopy.

However, existing methods face several significant limitations: 1) requiring task- or dataset-specific models; 2) neglecting real-world image degradations (\textit{e.g.}, noise), which causes failure when processing degraded inputs; 3) operating in pixel space, where attention mechanisms are computationally expensive; and 4) lacking user interaction capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework for multi-task, multi-degradation, and language-guided image fusion. Our framework includes two key components: 1) a practical degradation pipeline that simulates real-world image degradations and generates interactive prompts to guide the model; 2) an all-in-one Diffusion Transformer (DiT) operating in latent space, which fuses a clean image conditioned on both the degraded inputs and the generated prompts. Furthermore, we introduce principled modifications to the original DiT architecture to better suit the fusion task. Based on this framework, we develop two versions of the model: Regression-based and Flow Matching-based variants. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations and outperforms previous restoration+fusion and all-in-one pipelines.

Existing supervised learning methods (SLMs) can yield promising results when test data degradation matches the training ones, but they face challenges in generalizing to unknown degradations. To unleash the potential and generalization ability of SLMs, we propose a novel self-supervised unknown-to-known degradation transformation framework (U2K) for blind HSI fusion, which adaptively transforms unknown degradation into the same type of degradation as those handled by pre-trained SLMs. Specifically, the proposed U2K framework consists of: (1) spatial and spectral Degradation Wrapping (DW) modules that map HR-HSI to unknown degraded HR-MSI and LR-HSI, and (2) Degradation Transformation (DT) modules that convert these wrapped data into predefined degradation patterns. The transformed HR-MSI and LR-HSI pairs are then processed by a pre-trained network to reconstruct the target HR-HSI. We train the U2K framework in a self-supervised manner using consistency loss and greedy alternating optimization, significantly improving the flexibility of blind HSI fusion. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed U2K framework in boosting the adaptability of five existing SLMs under various degradation settings and surpassing state-of-the-art blind methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming and prone to errors. The emergence of deep learning techniques has provided innovative solutions to improve diagnostic efficiency. However, single deep learning models frequently face issues related to extracting key features from complex retinal images. To handle this problem, we present an effective ensemble method for DR diagnosis comprising four main phases: image pre-processing, selection of backbone pre-trained models, feature enhancement, and optimization. Our methodology initiates with the pre-processing phase, where we apply CLAHE to enhance image contrast and Gamma correction is then used to adjust the brightness for better feature recognition. We then apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for image fusion by combining multi-resolution details to create a richer dataset. Then, we selected three pre-trained models with the best performance named DenseNet169, MobileNetV1, and Xception for diverse feature extraction. To further improve feature extraction, an improved residual block is integrated into each model. Finally, the predictions from these base models are then aggregated using weighted ensemble approach, with the weights optimized by using Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA).SSA intelligently explores the weight space and finds the optimal configuration of base architectures to maximize the performance of the ensemble model. The proposed model is evaluated on the multiclass Kaggle APTOS 2019 dataset and obtained 88.52% accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Our analysis reveals that shallower fusion yields smaller distribution gap. However, the limited discriminative power of shallow networks hard to distinguish task-relevant information from noise, limiting the potential of pixel-level fusion. To break shallow limits, we propose a novel \textbf{T}ask-driven \textbf{P}ixel-level \textbf{F}usion network, named \textbf{TPF}, which unveils the power of pixel-level fusion in RGBT tracking through a progressive learning framework. In particular, we design a lightweight Pixel-level Fusion Adapter (PFA) that exploits Mamba's linear complexity to ensure real-time, low-latency RGBT tracking. To enhance the fusion capabilities of the PFA, our task-driven progressive learning framework first utilizes adaptive multi-expert distillation to inherits fusion knowledge from state-of-the-art image fusion models, establishing robust initialization, and then employs a decoupled representation learning scheme to achieve task-relevant information fusion. Moreover, to overcome appearance variations between the initial template and search frames, we presents a nearest-neighbor dynamic template updating scheme, which selects the most reliable frame closest to the current search frame as the dynamic template. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TPF significantly outperforms existing most of advanced trackers on four public RGBT tracking datasets.

However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, multi-sensor image fusion is an effective choice to overcome these constraints. However, multi-modal image sensors are heterogeneous and have domain and granularity gaps. In addition, the multi-sensor images can be misaligned due to intricate background clutters, fluctuating illumination conditions, and uncontrolled sensor settings. In this paper, to overcome these issues, we decompose, align, and fuse multiple image sensor data for target classification. We extract the domain-specific and domain-invariant features from each sensor data. We propose to develop a shared unified discrete token (UDT) space between sensors to reduce the domain and granularity gaps. Additionally, we develop an alignment module to overcome the misalignment between multi-sensors and emphasize the discriminative representation of the UDT space. In the alignment module, we introduce sparsity constraints to provide a better cross-modal representation of the UDT space and robustness against various sensor settings. We achieve superior classification performance compared to single-modality classifiers and several state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion algorithms on four multi-sensor ATR datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages Accepted in the IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> | None |

Mainstream ADFMs often rely on highly synthetic multi-modal multi-quality images for supervision, limiting their effectiveness in cross-modal and rare degradation scenarios. The inherent relationship among these multi-modal, multi-quality images of the same scene provides explicit supervision for training, but also raises above problems. To address these limitations, we present LURE, a Learning-driven Unified Representation model for infrared and visible Image Fusion, which is degradation-aware. LURE decouples multi-modal multi-quality data at the data level and recouples this relationship in a unified latent feature space (ULFS) by proposing a novel unified loss. This decoupling circumvents data-level limitations of prior models and allows leveraging real-world restoration datasets for training high-quality degradation-aware models, sidestepping above issues. To enhance text-image interaction, we refine image-text interaction and residual structures via Text-Guided Attention (TGA) and an inner residual structure. These enhances text's spatial perception of images and preserve more visual details. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across general fusion, degradation-aware fusion, and downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

Retinex theory, which separates image illumination from scene reflectance, is naturally adopted to ensure consistent scene representation and effective information fusion across varied exposure levels. However, the conventional pixel-wise multiplication of illumination and reflectance inadequately models the glare effect induced by overexposure. To better adapt this theory for multi-exposure image fusion, we introduce an unsupervised and controllable method termed~\textbf{(Retinex-MEF)}. Specifically, our method decomposes multi-exposure images into separate illumination components and a shared reflectance component, and effectively modeling the glare induced by overexposure. Employing a bidirectional loss constraint to learn the common reflectance component, our approach effectively mitigates the glare effect. Furthermore, we establish a controllable exposure fusion criterion, enabling global exposure adjustments while preserving contrast, thus overcoming the constraints of fixed-level fusion. A series of experiments across multiple datasets, including underexposure-overexposure fusion, exposure control fusion, and homogeneous extreme exposure fusion, demonstrate the effective decomposition and flexible fusion capability of our model.</p></details> |  | None |

However, data collected from a realistic scene usually have a non-Euclidean structure, where Euclidean metric might be limited in representing the true data relationships, degrading fusion performance. To address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning framework is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SPDFusion, which extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with human visual perception. Actually, the SPD matrix underpins our network learning, with a cross-modal fusion strategy employed to harness modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information. Subsequently, an attention module is designed to process the learned weight matrix, facilitating the weighting of spatial global correlation semantics via SPD matrix multiplication. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion network based on cross-modal manifold learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our framework exhibits superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures | None |

To tackle this problem, we propose the Reference-Driven Inpainting Stitcher (RDIStitcher), which reformulates the image fusion and rectangling as a reference-based inpainting model, incorporating a larger modification fusion area and stronger modification intensity than previous methods. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised model training method, which enables the implementation of RDIStitcher without requiring labeled data by fine-tuning a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model. Recognizing difficulties in assessing the quality of stitched images, we present the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)-based metrics, offering a new perspective on evaluating stitched image quality. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances content coherence and seamless transitions in the stitched images.

In recent years, multi-scale exposure fusion approaches based on detail-enhancement have led the way for improvement in highlight and shadow details. Most of such methods, however, are too computationally expensive to be deployed on mobile devices. This paper presents a perceptual multi-exposure fusion method that not just ensures fine shadow/highlight details but with lower complexity than detailenhanced methods. We analyze the potential defects of three classical exposure measures in lieu of using detail-enhancement component and improve two of them, namely adaptive Wellexposedness (AWE) and the gradient of color images (3-D gradient). AWE designed in YCbCr color space considers the difference between varying exposure images. 3-D gradient is employed to extract fine details. We build a large-scale multiexposure benchmark dataset suitable for static scenes, which contains 167 image sequences all told. Experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed method exceeds existing eight state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visually and MEF-SSIM value. Moreover, our approach can achieve a better improvement for current image enhancement techniques, ensuring fine detail in bright light.</p></details> |  | None |

In most cases, Backscattered Electron (BSE) images obtained using SEM do not contain sufficient information for mineral segmentation. Therefore, imaging is often complemented with point-wise Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) spectral measurements that provide highly accurate information about the chemical composition but that are time-consuming to acquire. This motivates the use of sparse spectral data in conjunction with BSE images for mineral segmentation. The unstructured nature of the spectral data makes most traditional image fusion techniques unsuitable for BSE-EDS fusion. We propose using graph neural networks to fuse the two modalities and segment the mineral phases simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that providing EDS data for as few as 1% of BSE pixels produces accurate segmentation, enabling rapid analysis of mineral samples. The proposed data fusion pipeline is versatile and can be adapted to other domains that involve image data and point-wise measurements.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate Time of Birth (ToB) documentation is essential for optimizing neonatal care, as timely interventions are vital for proper resuscitation. However, current clinical methods for recording ToB often rely on manual processes, which can be prone to inaccuracies. In this study, we present a novel two-stream fusion system that combines the power of image and video analysis to accurately detect the ToB from thermal recordings in the delivery room and operating theater. By integrating static and dynamic streams, our approach captures richer birth-related spatiotemporal features, leading to more robust and precise ToB estimation. We demonstrate that this synergy between data modalities enhances performance over single-stream approaches. Our system achieves 95.7% precision and 84.8% recall in detecting birth within short video clips. Additionally, with the help of a score aggregation module, it successfully identifies ToB in 100% of test cases, with a median absolute error of 2 seconds and an absolute mean deviation of 4.5 seconds compared to manual annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE 25th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing</p></details> | None |

This study proposes a novel explainable Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) framework that identifies subtype-specific Regions of Interest (ROIs) from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) while integrating cell distribution characteristics and image information. Our framework simultaneously addresses three objectives: (1) indicating appropriate ROIs for each subtype, (2) explaining the frequency and spatial distribution of characteristic cell types, and (3) achieving high-accuracy subtyping by leveraging both image and cell-distribution modalities. The proposed method fuses cell graph and image features extracted from each patch in the WSI using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach and classifies subtypes within an MIL framework. Experiments on a dataset of 1,233 WSIs demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among ten comparative methods and provides region-level and cell-level explanations that align with a pathologist's perspectives.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figure | None |

Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based fusion methods. However, these models frequently encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes in real-world applications, which severely impact their performance and reliability. Therefore, addressing the challenge of OOD data is crucial for the safe deployment of these models in open-world environments. Unlike existing research, our focus is on the challenges posed by OOD data in real-world applications and on enhancing the robustness and generalization of models. In this paper, we propose an infrared-visible fusion framework based on Multi-View Augmentation. For external data augmentation, Top-k Selective Vision Alignment is employed to mitigate distribution shifts between datasets by performing RGB-wise transformations on visible images. This strategy effectively introduces augmented samples, enhancing the adaptability of the model to complex real-world scenarios. Additionally, for internal data augmentation, self-supervised learning is established using Weak-Aggressive Augmentation. This enables the model to learn more robust and general feature representations during the fusion process, thereby improving robustness and generalization.

Existing singular modality image enhancement methods struggle to restore image regions lacking valid information. By leveraging light-impervious infrared images, visible and infrared image fusion methods have the potential to reveal information hidden in darkness. However, they primarily emphasize inter-modal complementation but neglect intra-modal enhancement, limiting the perceptual quality of output images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, dubbed visible and infrared information synthesis (VIIS), which aims to achieve both information enhancement and fusion of the two modalities. Given the difficulty in obtaining ground truth in the VIIS task, we design an information synthesis pretext task (ISPT) based on image augmentation. We employ a diffusion model as the framework and design a sparse attention-based dual-modalities residual (SADMR) conditioning mechanism to enhance information interaction between the two modalities. This mechanism enables features with prior knowledge from both modalities to adaptively and iteratively attend to each modality's information during the denoising process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms not only the state-of-the-art methods in relevant fields but also the newly designed baselines capable of both information enhancement and fusion.

The existing approaches for image fusion often rely on training combined with downstream tasks to obtain highlevel visual information, which is effective in emphasizing target objects and delivering impressive results in visual quality and task-specific applications. Instead of being driven by downstream tasks, our model called MaeFuse utilizes a pretrained encoder from Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which facilities the omni features extraction for low-level reconstruction and high-level vision tasks, to obtain perception friendly features with a low cost. In order to eliminate the domain gap of different modal features and the block effect caused by the MAE encoder, we further develop a guided training strategy. This strategy is meticulously crafted to ensure that the fusion layer seamlessly adjusts to the feature space of the encoder, gradually enhancing the fusion performance. The proposed method can facilitate the comprehensive integration of feature vectors from both infrared and visible modalities, thus preserving the rich details inherent in each modal. MaeFuse not only introduces a novel perspective in the realm of fusion techniques but also stands out with impressive performance across various public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by TIP 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/Henry-Lee-real/MaeFuse) |

However, existing methods often neglect the complementary role of infrared image in restoring visible image features under hazy conditions. To address this, we propose a joint learning framework that utilizes infrared image for the restoration and fusion of hazy IR-VIS images. To mitigate the adverse effects of feature diversity between IR-VIS images, we introduce a prompt generation mechanism that regulates modality-specific feature incompatibility. This creates a prompt selection matrix from non-shared image information, followed by prompt embeddings generated from a prompt pool. These embeddings help generate candidate features for dehazing. We further design an infrared-assisted feature restoration mechanism that selects candidate features based on haze density, enabling simultaneous restoration and fusion within a single-stage framework. To enhance fusion quality, we construct a multi-stage prompt embedding fusion module that leverages feature supplementation from the prompt generation module. Our method effectively fuses IR-VIS images while removing haze, yielding clear, haze-free fusion results. In contrast to two-stage methods that dehaze and then fuse, our approach enables collaborative training in a single-stage framework, making the model relatively lightweight and suitable for practical deployment. Experimental results validate its effectiveness and demonstrate advantages over existing methods.

In the mainstream modeling strategies, i.e., CNN and Transformer, the input images are treated as the equal-sized grid of pixels in the Euclidean space. They have limitations in facing remote sensing images with irregular ground objects. Graph is the more flexible structure, however, there are two major challenges when modeling spatial-spectral properties with graph: \emph{1) constructing the customized graph structure for spatial-spectral relationship priors}; \emph{2) learning the unified spatial-spectral representation through the graph}. To address these challenges, we propose the spatial-spectral heterogeneous graph learning network, named \textbf{HetSSNet}. Specifically, HetSSNet initially constructs the heterogeneous graph structure for pansharpening, which explicitly describes pansharpening-specific relationships. Subsequently, the basic relationship pattern generation module is designed to extract the multiple relationship patterns from the heterogeneous graph. Finally, relationship pattern aggregation module is exploited to collaboratively learn unified spatial-spectral representation across different relationships among nodes with adaptive importance learning from local and global perspectives.

To overcome the shortcomings of existing fusion methods in extracting multi-scale local features and preserving global features, this paper proposes a novel cross-modal image fusion approach based on a multi-scale convolutional neural network with attention Transformer (MATCNN). MATCNN utilizes the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) to extract local features at different scales and employs the global feature extraction module (GFEM) to extract global features. Combining the two reduces the loss of detail features and improves the ability of global feature representation. Simultaneously, an information mask is used to label pertinent details within the images, aiming to enhance the proportion of preserving significant information in infrared images and background textures in visible images in fused images. Subsequently, a novel optimization algorithm is developed, leveraging the mask to guide feature extraction through the integration of content, structural similarity index measurement, and global feature loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted across various datasets, revealing that MATCNN effectively highlights infrared salient targets, preserves additional details in visible images, and achieves better fusion results for cross-modal images.

Deep learning-based image fusion algorithms face significant challenges, including the lack of a definitive ground truth and the corresponding distance measurement. Additionally, current manually defined loss functions limit the model's flexibility and generalizability for various fusion tasks. To address these limitations, we propose ReFusion, a unified meta-learning based image fusion framework that dynamically optimizes the fusion loss for various tasks through source image reconstruction. Compared to existing methods, ReFusion employs a parameterized loss function, that allows the training framework to be dynamically adapted according to the specific fusion scenario and task. ReFusion consists of three key components: a fusion module, a source reconstruction module, and a loss proposal module. We employ a meta-learning strategy to train the loss proposal module using the reconstruction loss. This strategy forces the fused image to be more conducive to reconstruct source images, allowing the loss proposal module to generate a adaptive fusion loss that preserves the optimal information from the source images. The update of the fusion module relies on the learnable fusion loss proposed by the loss proposal module. The three modules update alternately, enhancing each other to optimize the fusion loss for different tasks and consistently achieve satisfactory results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFusion is capable of adapting to various tasks, including infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure image fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is published in International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2024</p></details> | None |

Current approaches primarily focus on acquiring informative fusion images at the visual display stratum through intricate mappings. Although some approaches attempt to jointly optimize image fusion and downstream tasks, these efforts often lack direct guidance or interaction, serving only to assist with a predefined fusion loss. To address this, we propose an ``Unfolding Attribution Analysis Fusion network'' (UAAFusion), using attribution analysis to tailor fused images more effectively for semantic segmentation, enhancing the interaction between the fusion and segmentation. Specifically, we utilize attribution analysis techniques to explore the contributions of semantic regions in the source images to task discrimination. At the same time, our fusion algorithm incorporates more beneficial features from the source images, thereby allowing the segmentation to guide the fusion process. Our method constructs a model-driven unfolding network that uses optimization objectives derived from attribution analysis, with an attribution fusion loss calculated from the current state of the segmentation network. We also develop a new pathway function for attribution analysis, specifically tailored to the fusion tasks in our unfolding network. An attribution attention mechanism is integrated at each network stage, allowing the fusion network to prioritize areas and pixels crucial for high-level recognition tasks. Additionally, to mitigate the information loss in traditional unfolding networks, a memory augmentation module is incorporated into our network to improve the information flow across various network layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in image fusion and applicability to semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT) 2024</p></details> | None |

The proposed strategy achieves the fusion of PET and CT images by utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an Autoencoder. Subsequently, a new ensemble-based classifier developed, Deep Ensembled Multimodal Fusion (DEMF), employing majority voting to classify the sample images under examination. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) employed to visualize the classification accuracy of cancer-affected images.

These assessments include temporal data with varying sampling rates, discrete single-point measurements, therapeutic interventions such as medication administration, and images. While physicians are able to process and integrate diverse modalities intuitively, neural networks need specific modeling for each modality complicating the training procedure. We demonstrate that this complexity can be significantly reduced by visualizing all information as images along with unstructured text and subsequently training a conventional vision-text transformer. Our approach, Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements (ViTiMM), not only simplifies data preprocessing and modeling but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping, as evaluated on 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The modalities include patient's clinical measurements, medications, X-ray images, and electrocardiography scans. We hope our work inspires advancements in multi-modal medical AI by reducing the training complexity to (visual) prompt engineering, thus lowering entry barriers and enabling no-code solutions for training.

While current methods have advanced the fusion of texture details and semantic information, their complex training processes hinder broader applications. Addressing this challenge, we introduce E2E-MFD, a novel end-to-end algorithm for multimodal fusion detection. E2E-MFD streamlines the process, achieving high performance with a single training phase. It employs synchronous joint optimization across components to avoid suboptimal solutions tied to individual tasks. Furthermore, it implements a comprehensive optimization strategy in the gradient matrix for shared parameters, ensuring convergence to an optimal fusion detection configuration. Our extensive testing on multiple public datasets reveals E2E-MFD's superior capabilities, showcasing not only visually appealing image fusion but also impressive detection outcomes, such as a 3.9% and 2.0% mAP50 increase on horizontal object detection dataset M3FD and oriented object detection dataset DroneVehicle, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Existing methods typically employ a two-branch encoder framework for multimodal feature extraction and design complicated feature fusion strategies to achieve feature extraction and fusion for multimodal semantic segmentation.

Since 2018, the field has entered the deep learning era, with an increasing variety of approaches introducing a range of networks and loss functions to enhance visual performance. However, challenges such as data compatibility, perception accuracy, and efficiency remain. Unfortunately, there is a lack of recent comprehensive surveys that address this rapidly expanding domain. This paper fills that gap by providing a thorough survey covering a broad range of topics. We introduce a multi-dimensional framework to elucidate common learning-based IVIF methods, from visual enhancement strategies to data compatibility and task adaptability. We also present a detailed analysis of these approaches, accompanied by a lookup table clarifying their core ideas. Furthermore, we summarize performance comparisons, both quantitatively and qualitatively, focusing on registration, fusion, and subsequent high-level tasks.

While existing methods leverage spatial and spectral relationships, they often suffer from limited receptive fields and insufficient feature utilization, leading to suboptimal performance. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality HSI data highlights the importance of efficient data utilization to maximize reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose HyFusion, a novel Dual-Coupled Network (DCN) framework designed to enhance cross-domain feature extraction and enable effective feature map reusing. The framework first processes HR-MSI and LR-HSI inputs through specialized subnetworks that mutually enhance each other during feature extraction, preserving complementary spatial and spectral details. At its core, HyFusion utilizes an Enhanced Reception Field Block (ERFB), which combines shifting-window attention and dense connections to expand the receptive field, effectively capturing long-range dependencies while minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion, significantly improving reconstruction quality while maintaining a compact model size and computational efficiency. By integrating enhanced receptive fields and feature map reusing into a coupled network architecture, HyFusion provides a practical and effective solution for HSI fusion in resource-constrained scenarios, setting a new benchmark in hyperspectral imaging.

Since neither the time of the appearance of an object on the road, nor its size and shape is known in advance, ML/DL-based approaches are not applicable. The task becomes more complicated due to variations in artificial illumination, inhomogeneous road surface texture, and unknown character and features of the object. To solve this problem we developed the depth and image fusion method that complements a search of small contrast objects by RGB-based method, and obstacle detection by stereo image-based approach with SLIC superpixel segmentation. We conducted experiments with static and low speed obstacles in an underground parking lot and demonstrated the successful work of the developed technique for detecting and even tracking small objects, which can be parking infrastructure objects, things left on the road, wheels, dropped boxes, etc.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Text-to-Image GAN with Pretrained Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00116v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating desired images conditioned on given text descriptions has received lots of attention. Recently, diffusion models and autoregressive models have demonstrated their outstanding expressivity and gradually replaced GAN as the favored architectures for text-to-image synthesis. However, they still face some obstacles: slow inference speed and expensive training costs. To achieve more powerful and faster text-to-image synthesis under complex scenes, we propose TIGER, a text-to-image GAN with pretrained representations. To be specific, we propose a vision-empowered discriminator and a high-capacity generator. (i) The vision-empowered discriminator absorbs the complex scene understanding ability and the domain generalization ability from pretrained vision models to enhance model performance. Unlike previous works, we explore stacking multiple pretrained models in our discriminator to collect multiple different representations. (ii) The high-capacity generator aims to achieve effective text-image fusion while increasing the model capacity. The high-capacity generator consists of multiple novel high-capacity fusion blocks (HFBlock). And the HFBlock contains several deep fusion modules and a global fusion module, which play different roles to benefit our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed TIGER both on standard and zero-shot text-to-image synthesis tasks. On the standard text-to-image synthesis task, TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, which obtain a new FID 5.48 (COCO) and 9.38 (CUB). On the zero-shot text-to-image synthesis task, we achieve comparable performance with fewer model parameters, smaller training data size and faster inference speed. Additionally, more experiments and analyses are conducted in the Supplementary Material.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-modality image fusion, particularly integrating infrared imaging, offers a robust solution by combining complementary information from different modalities to enhance scene understanding and decision-making. However, current methods face significant limitations: GAN-based approaches often produce blurry images that lack fine-grained details, while AE-based methods may introduce bias toward specific modalities, leading to unnatural fusion results. To address these challenges, we propose DAE-Fuse, a novel two-phase discriminative autoencoder framework that generates sharp and natural fused images. Furthermore, We pioneer the extension of image fusion techniques from static images to the video domain while preserving temporal consistency across frames, thus advancing the perceptual capabilities required for autonomous navigation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DAE-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with superior generalizability to tasks like medical image fusion.</p></details> |  | None |

Apart from that, there is a trend to design a manageable and editable algorithm as the different needs of real application scenarios. To tackle these issues, we introduce 3D LUT technology, which can enhance images with ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolution in real time on resource-constrained devices. However, since the fusion of information from multiple images with different exposure rates is uncertain, and this uncertainty significantly trials the generalization power of the 3D LUT grid. To address this issue and ensure a robust learning space for the model, we propose using a teacher-student network to model the uncertainty on the 3D LUT grid.Furthermore, we provide an editable mode for the multi-exposure image fusion algorithm by using the implicit representation function to match the requirements in different scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is highly competitive in efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing learning-based fusion approaches attempt to construct various loss functions to preserve complementary features, while neglecting to discover the inter-relationship between the two modalities, leading to redundant or even invalid information on the fusion results. Moreover, most methods focus on strengthening the network with an increase in depth while neglecting the importance of feature transmission, causing vital information degeneration. To alleviate these issues, we propose a coupled contrastive learning network, dubbed CoCoNet, to realize infrared and visible image fusion in an end-to-end manner. Concretely, to simultaneously retain typical features from both modalities and to avoid artifacts emerging on the fused result, we develop a coupled contrastive constraint in our loss function. In a fused image, its foreground target / background detail part is pulled close to the infrared / visible source and pushed far away from the visible / infrared source in the representation space. We further exploit image characteristics to provide data-sensitive weights, allowing our loss function to build a more reliable relationship with source images. A multi-level attention module is established to learn rich hierarchical feature representation and to comprehensively transfer features in the fusion process. We also apply the proposed CoCoNet on medical image fusion of different types, e.g., magnetic resonance image, positron emission tomography image, and single photon emission computed tomography image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under both subjective and objective evaluation, especially in preserving prominent targets and recovering vital textural details.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BSAFusion: A Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment Network for Unaligned Medical Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08050v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If unaligned multimodal medical images can be simultaneously aligned and fused using a single-stage approach within a unified processing framework, it will not only achieve mutual promotion of dual tasks but also help reduce the complexity of the model. However, the design of this model faces the challenge of incompatible requirements for feature fusion and alignment; specifically, feature alignment requires consistency among corresponding features, whereas feature fusion requires the features to be complementary to each other. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an unaligned medical image fusion method called Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment and Fusion (BSFA-F) strategy. To reduce the negative impact of modality differences on cross-modal feature matching, we incorporate the Modal Discrepancy-Free Feature Representation (MDF-FR) method into BSFA-F. MDF-FR utilizes a Modality Feature Representation Head (MFRH) to integrate the global information of the input image. By injecting the information contained in MFRH of the current image into other modality images, it effectively reduces the impact of modality differences on feature alignment while preserving the complementary information carried by different images. In terms of feature alignment, BSFA-F employs a bidirectional stepwise alignment deformation field prediction strategy based on the path independence of vector displacement between two points. This strategy solves the problem of large spans and inaccurate deformation field prediction in single-step alignment. Finally, Multi-Modal Feature Fusion block achieves the fusion of aligned features. The experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

As infrared images provide additional clear edge information that complements RGB images, fusing RGB and infrared images has potential to enhance the detection ability in poor-illumination environments. However, existing works involving both visible and infrared images only focus on image fusion, instead of object detection. Moreover, they directly fuse the two kinds of image modalities, which ignores the mutual interference between them. To fuse the two modalities to maximize the advantages of cross-modality, we design a dual-enhancement-based cross-modality object detection network DEYOLO, in which semantic-spatial cross modality and novel bi-directional decoupled focus modules are designed to achieve the detection-centered mutual enhancement of RGB-infrared (RGB-IR). Specifically, a dual semantic enhancing channel weight assignment module (DECA) and a dual spatial enhancing pixel weight assignment module (DEPA) are firstly proposed to aggregate cross-modality information in the feature space to improve the feature representation ability, such that feature fusion can aim at the object detection task. Meanwhile, a dual-enhancement mechanism, including enhancements for two-modality fusion and single modality, is designed in both DECAand DEPAto reduce interference between the two kinds of image modalities. Then, a novel bi-directional decoupled focus is developed to enlarge the receptive field of the backbone network in different directions, which improves the representation quality of DEYOLO. Extensive experiments on M3FD and LLVIP show that our approach outperforms SOTA object detection algorithms by a clear margin.

Current methods typically apply direct fusion from the two modalities without valid supervision, failing to fully perceive the deep modality-complementary information and hence, resulting in a superficial understanding of inter-modality connections. To bridge this gap, we propose a simple and effective solution for unsupervised HIF with an assumption that modality decoupling is essential for HIF. We introduce the modality clustering loss that ensures clear guidance of the modality, decoupling towards modality-shared features while steering clear of modality-complementary ones. Also, we propose an end-to-end Modality-Decoupled Spatial-Spectral Fusion (MossFuse) framework that decouples shared and complementary information across modalities and aggregates a concise representation of the LR-HSI and HR-MSI to reduce the modality redundancy. Systematic experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our simple and effective approach consistently outperforms the existing HIF methods while requiring considerably fewer parameters with reduced inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently launched satellites can concurrently acquire HSIs and panchromatic (PAN) images, enabling the restoration of HSIs to generate clean and high-resolution imagery through fusing PAN images for denoising and super-resolution. However, previous studies treated these two tasks as independent processes, resulting in accumulated errors. This paper introduces \textbf{H}yperspectral \textbf{I}mage Joint \textbf{Pand}enoising \textbf{a}nd Pan\textbf{s}harpening (Hipandas), a novel learning paradigm that reconstructs HRHS images from noisy low-resolution HSIs (LRHS) and high-resolution PAN images. The proposed zero-shot Hipandas framework consists of a guided denoising network, a guided super-resolution network, and a PAN reconstruction network, utilizing an HSI low-rank prior and a newly introduced detail-oriented low-rank prior. The interconnection of these networks complicates the training process, necessitating a two-stage training strategy to ensure effective training. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms, yielding more accurate and visually pleasing HRHS images.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently proposed models with linear complexity (e.g., Mamba) have garnered significant attention and have achieved a good balance between accuracy and computational cost across a variety of visual tasks. Relevant review articles also suggest that while these models can perform well on some pedestrian attribute recognition datasets, they are generally weaker than the corresponding Transformer models. To further tap into the potential of the novel Mamba architecture for PAR tasks, this paper designs and adapts Mamba into two typical PAR frameworks, i.e., the text-image fusion approach and pure vision Mamba multi-label recognition framework. It is found that interacting with attribute tags as additional input does not always lead to an improvement, specifically, Vim can be enhanced, but VMamba cannot. This paper further designs various hybrid Mamba-Transformer variants and conducts thorough experimental validations. These experimental results indicate that simply enhancing Mamba with a Transformer does not always lead to performance improvements but yields better results under certain settings. We hope this empirical study can further inspire research in Mamba for PAR, and even extend into the domain of multi-label recognition, through the design of these network structures and comprehensive experimentation.

However, the previous decomposition strategies (base \& detail or low-frequency \& high-frequency) are too rough to present the common features and the unique features of source modalities, which leads to a decline in the quality of the fused images. The existing strategies treat these relations as a binary system, which may not be suitable for the complex generation task (e.g. image fusion). To address this issue, a continuous decomposition-based fusion framework (Conti-Fuse) is proposed. Conti-Fuse treats the decomposition results as few samples along the feature variation trajectory of the source images, extending this concept to a more general state to achieve continuous decomposition. This novel continuous decomposition strategy enhances the representation of complementary information of inter-modal by increasing the number of decomposition samples, thus reducing the loss of critical information. To facilitate this process, the continuous decomposition module (CDM) is introduced to decompose the input into a series continuous components. The core module of CDM, State Transformer (ST), is utilized to efficiently capture the complementary information from source modalities. Furthermore, a novel decomposition loss function is also designed which ensures the smooth progression of the decomposition process while maintaining linear growth in time complexity with respect to the number of decomposition samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed Conti-Fuse achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art fusion methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The first approach enables existing RGB-pretrained vision models to directly utilize RGB-NIR information without fine-tuning. The second approach fine-tunes existing vision models to more effectively utilize RGB-NIR information.

Previous studies have mainly concentrated on estimating the posterior distribution of the latent high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI), leveraging an appropriate image prior and likelihood computed from the discrepancy between the latent HSI and observed images. Low rankness stands out for preserving latent HSI characteristics through matrix factorization among the various priors. However, the primary limitation in previous studies lies in the generalization of a fusion model with fixed resolution scales, which necessitates retraining whenever output resolutions are changed. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel continuous low-rank factorization (CLoRF) by integrating two neural representations into the matrix factorization, capturing spatial and spectral information, respectively. This approach enables us to harness both the low rankness from the matrix factorization and the continuity from neural representation in a self-supervised manner.Theoretically, we prove the low-rank property and Lipschitz continuity in the proposed continuous low-rank factorization. Experimentally, our method significantly surpasses existing techniques and achieves user-desired resolutions without the need for neural network retraining.

While convolutional neural networks have notably improved message capacity and imperceptibility, achieving high recovery accuracy remains challenging. This challenge arises because convolutional operations struggle to preserve the sequential order of message bits and effectively address the discrepancy between these two modalities. To address this, we propose StegaFormer, an innovative MLP-based framework designed to preserve bit order and enable global fusion between modalities. Specifically, StegaFormer incorporates three crucial components: Order-Preserving Message Encoder (OPME), Decoder (OPMD) and Global Message-Image Fusion (GMIF). OPME and OPMD aim to preserve the order of message bits by segmenting the entire sequence into equal-length segments and incorporating sequential information during encoding and decoding. Meanwhile, GMIF employs a cross-modality fusion mechanism to effectively fuse the features from the two uncorrelated modalities. Experimental results on the COCO and DIV2K datasets demonstrate that StegaFormer surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recovery accuracy, message capacity, and imperceptibility. We will make our code publicly available.</p></details> | BMVC 2024 | None |

Existing methods mostly adopt a simple weight in the loss function to decide the information retention of each modality rather than adaptively measuring complementary information for different image pairs. In this study, we propose a multi-scale dual attention (MDA) framework for infrared and visible image fusion, which is designed to measure and integrate complementary information in both structure and loss function at the image and patch level. In our method, the residual downsample block decomposes source images into three scales first. Then, dual attention fusion block integrates complementary information and generates a spatial and channel attention map at each scale for feature fusion. Finally, the output image is reconstructed by the residual reconstruction block. Loss function consists of image-level, feature-level and patch-level three parts, of which the calculation of the image-level and patch-level two parts are based on the weights generated by the complementary information measurement. Indeed, to constrain the pixel intensity distribution between the output and infrared image, a style loss is added. Our fusion results perform robust and informative across different scenarios.

While deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have significantly advanced fusion performance, some of the existing CNN-based methods fall short in capturing fine-grained multiscale and edge features, leading to suboptimal feature integration. Transformer-based models, on the other hand, are computationally intensive in both the training and fusion stages, making them impractical for real-time clinical use. Moreover, the clinical application of fused images remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based architecture that addresses these limitations by introducing a Dilated Residual Attention Network Module for effective multiscale feature extraction, coupled with a gradient operator to enhance edge detail learning. To ensure fast and efficient fusion, we present a parameter-free fusion strategy based on the weighted nuclear norm of softmax, which requires no additional computations during training or inference. Extensive experiments, including a downstream brain tumor classification task, demonstrate that our approach outperforms various baseline methods in terms of visual quality, texture preservation, and fusion speed, making it a possible practical solution for real-world clinical applications.

Current deep learning (DL) methods typically employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction and information integration. While CNNs are efficient, their limited receptive fields restrict their ability to capture global context. Transformers excel at learning global information but are computationally expensive. Recent advancements in the state space model (SSM), particularly Mamba, present a promising alternative by enabling global perception with low complexity. However, the potential of SSM for information integration remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose FusionMamba, an innovative method for efficient remote sensing image fusion. Our contributions are twofold. First, to effectively merge spatial and spectral features, we expand the single-input Mamba block to accommodate dual inputs, creating the FusionMamba block, which serves as a plug-and-play solution for information integration. Second, we incorporate Mamba and FusionMamba blocks into an interpretable network architecture tailored for remote sensing image fusion. Our designs utilize two U-shaped network branches, each primarily composed of four-directional Mamba blocks, to extract spatial and spectral features separately and hierarchically. The resulting feature maps are sufficiently merged in an auxiliary network branch constructed with FusionMamba blocks. Furthermore, we improve the representation of spectral information through an enhanced channel attention module. Quantitative and qualitative valuation results across six datasets demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance.

However, existing methods tend to prioritize natural image fusion and focus on information complementary and network training strategies. They ignore the essential distinction between natural and medical image fusion and the influence of underlying components. This paper dissects the significant differences between the two tasks regarding fusion goals, statistical properties, and data distribution. Based on this, we rethink the suitability of the normalization strategy and convolutional kernels for end-to-end MMIF.Specifically, this paper proposes a mixture of instance normalization and group normalization to preserve sample independence and reinforce intrinsic feature correlation.This strategy promotes the potential of enriching feature maps, thus boosting fusion performance. To this end, we further introduce the large kernel convolution, effectively expanding receptive fields and enhancing the preservation of image detail. Moreover, the proposed multipath adaptive fusion module recalibrates the decoder input with features of various scales and receptive fields, ensuring the transmission of crucial information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance in multiple fusion tasks and significantly improves downstream applications.

However, existing methods face challenges such as increased training complexity and significantly compromised performance of individual tasks when addressing multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. To tackle this, we propose Task-Oriented Adaptive Regulation (T-OAR), an adaptive mechanism specifically designed for multi-task environments. Additionally, we introduce the Task-related Dynamic Prompt Injection (T-DPI) module, which generates task-specific dynamic prompts from user-input text instructions and integrates them into target representations. This guides the feature extraction module to produce representations that are more closely aligned with the specific requirements of downstream tasks. By incorporating the T-DPI module into the T-OAR framework, our approach generates fusion images tailored to task-specific requirements without the need for separate training or task-specific weights. This not only reduces computational costs but also enhances adaptability and performance across multiple tasks. Experimental results show that our method excels in object detection, semantic segmentation, and salient object detection, demonstrating its strong adaptability, flexibility, and task specificity. This provides an efficient solution for image fusion in multi-task environments, highlighting the technology's potential across diverse applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |

While traditional Machine Learning (TML) approaches have demonstrated effectiveness, they often encounter substantial obstacles in real-world applications, including the variability of optimal feature sets, subjectivity in human-driven design, inherent biases, and methodological limitations. Specifically, TML suffers from the curse of dimensionality, difficulties in feature selection and extraction, insufficient consideration of spatial information, limited robustness against noise, scalability issues, and inadequate adaptability to complex data distributions. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as robust solutions to address these challenges. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of current trends and future prospects in HSC, emphasizing advancements from DL models to the increasing adoption of Transformer and Mamba Model architectures. We systematically review key concepts, methodologies, and state-of-the-art approaches in DL for HSC. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of Transformer-based models and the Mamba Model in HSC, detailing their advantages and challenges. Emerging trends in HSC are explored, including in-depth discussions on Explainable AI and Interoperability concepts, alongside Diffusion Models for image denoising, feature extraction, and image fusion. Comprehensive experimental results were conducted on three HS datasets to substantiate the efficacy of various conventional DL models and Transformers. Additionally, we identify several open challenges and pertinent research questions in the field of HSC. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential applications aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of HSC.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing MMIF methods lack the ability to resist different weather interferences in real-world scenes, preventing them from being useful in practical applications such as autonomous driving. To bridge this research gap, we proposed an all-weather MMIF model. Achieving effective multi-tasking in this context is particularly challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of weather conditions. A key obstacle lies in the 'black box' nature of current deep learning architectures, which restricts their multi-tasking capabilities. To overcome this, we decompose the network into two modules: a fusion module and a restoration module. For the fusion module, we introduce a learnable low-rank representation model to decompose images into low-rank and sparse components. This interpretable feature separation allows us to better observe and understand images. For the restoration module, we propose a physically-aware clear feature prediction module based on an atmospheric scattering model that can deduce variations in light transmittance from both scene illumination and reflectance. We also construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset with 100,000 image pairs across rain, haze, and snow conditions, covering various degradation levels and diverse scenes to thoroughly evaluate image fusion methods in adverse weather. Experimental results in both real-world and synthetic scenes show that the proposed algorithm excels in detail recovery and multi-modality feature extraction.

To address this challenge, we propose the Brightness Adaptive multimodal dynamic fusion framework (BA-Fusion), which achieves robust image fusion despite dynamic brightness fluctuations. Specifically, we introduce a Brightness Adaptive Gate (BAG) module, which is designed to dynamically select features from brightness-related channels for normalization, while preserving brightness-independent structural information within the source images. Furthermore, we propose a brightness consistency loss function to optimize the BAG module. The entire framework is tuned via alternating training strategies. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in preserving multi-modal image information and visual fidelity, while exhibiting remarkable robustness across varying brightness levels.

In this work, we introduce an interpretable network for the MMIF task, named FNet, based on an l0-regularized multi-modal convolutional sparse coding (MCSC) model. Specifically, for solving the l0-regularized CSC problem, we develop an algorithm unrolling-based l0-regularized sparse coding (LZSC) block. Given different modality source images, FNet first separates the unique and common features from them using the LZSC block and then these features are combined to generate the final fused image. Additionally, we propose an l0-regularized MCSC model for the inverse fusion process. Based on this model, we introduce an interpretable inverse fusion network named IFNet, which is utilized during FNet's training. Extensive experiments show that FNet achieves high-quality fusion results across five different MMIF tasks. Furthermore, we show that FNet enhances downstream object detection in visible-thermal image pairs. We have also visualized the intermediate results of FNet, which demonstrates the good interpretability of our network.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image fusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential deployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion with a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution from a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of image fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we decompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source data. The decomposed components represent the effective information from the source data, thus the gap between them reflects the Relative Dominability (RD) of the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we prove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source reconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant regions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding fusion weight, achieving robust results. Extensive experiments and discussions with in-depth analysis on multiple benchmarks confirm our findings and superiority.

Existing methods usually employ distinct constraint designs tailored to specific scenes, forming fixed fusion paradigms. However, this data-driven fusion approach is challenging to deploy in varying scenarios, especially in rapidly changing environments. To address this issue, we propose a conditional controllable fusion (CCF) framework for general image fusion tasks without specific training. Due to the dynamic differences of different samples, our CCF employs specific fusion constraints for each individual in practice. Given the powerful generative capabilities of the denoising diffusion model, we first inject the specific constraints into the pre-trained DDPM as adaptive fusion conditions. The appropriate conditions are dynamically selected to ensure the fusion process remains responsive to the specific requirements in each reverse diffusion stage. Thus, CCF enables conditionally calibrating the fused images step by step. Extensive experiments validate our effectiveness in general fusion tasks across diverse scenarios against the competing methods without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

Additionally, these methods often overlook the specificity of foreground objects, weakening the salience of the objects of interest within the fused images. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel interactive multi-modal image fusion framework based on the text-modulated diffusion model, called Text-DiFuse. First, this framework integrates feature-level information integration into the diffusion process, allowing adaptive degradation removal and multi-modal information fusion. This is the first attempt to deeply and explicitly embed information fusion within the diffusion process, effectively addressing compound degradation in image fusion. Second, by embedding the combination of the text and zero-shot location model into the diffusion fusion process, a text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy is developed. This enables user-customized text control to improve fusion performance and highlight foreground objects in the fused images. Extensive experiments on diverse public datasets show that our Text-DiFuse achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance across various scenarios with complex degradation.

Most existing algorithms only perform pixel-level or feature-level fusion from different modalities in the spatial domain. They usually overlook the information in the frequency domain, and some of them suffer from inefficiency due to excessively complex structures. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient Spatial-Frequency Domain Fusion (SFDFusion) network for infrared and visible image fusion. First, we propose a Dual-Modality Refinement Module (DMRM) to extract complementary information. This module extracts useful information from both the infrared and visible modalities in the spatial domain and enhances fine-grained spatial details. Next, to introduce frequency domain information, we construct a Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) that transforms the spatial domain to the frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and then integrates frequency domain information. Additionally, we design a frequency domain fusion loss to provide guidance for the fusion process. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method produces fused images with significant advantages in various fusion metrics and visual effects. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high efficiency in image fusion and good performance on downstream detection tasks, thereby satisfying the real-time demands of advanced visual tasks.</p></details> | accept in ECAI 2024 | None |

To this end, we rethink the IVIF outside the box, proposing a complementary to harmonious information transfer network (CHITNet). It reasonably transfers complementary information into harmonious one, which integrates both the shared and complementary features from two modalities. Specifically, to skillfully sidestep aggregating complementary information in IVIF, we design a mutual information transfer (MIT) module to mutually represent features from two modalities, roughly transferring complementary information into harmonious one. Then, a harmonious information acquisition supervised by source image (HIASSI) module is devised to further ensure the complementary to harmonious information transfer after MIT. Meanwhile, we also propose a structure information preservation (SIP) module to guarantee that the edge structure information of the source images can be transferred to the fusion results. Moreover, a mutual promotion training paradigm with interaction loss is adopted to facilitate better collaboration among MIT, HIASSI and SIP. In this way, the proposed method is able to generate fused images with higher qualities.

The aim of MEF-based tone mapping is to display high dynamic range (HDR) images on devices with limited dynamic range. To achieve this, this method generates a stack of differently exposed images from an input HDR image and fuses them into a single image. Our approach addresses the limitations of MEF-based tone mapping with existing segmentation-based exposure compensation, which often result in visually unappealing outcomes due to inappropriate exposure value selection. The proposed exposure compensation method first segments the input HDR image into subregions based on luminance values of pixels. It then determines exposure values for multi-exposure images to maximize contrast between regions while preserving relative luminance relationships. This approach contrasts with conventional methods that may invert luminance relationships or compromise contrast between regions. Additionally, we present an improved technique for calculating fusion weights to better reflect the effects of exposure compensation in the final fused image. In a simulation experiment to evaluate the quality of tone-mapped images, the MEF-based tone mapping with the proposed method outperforms three typical tone mapping methods including conventional MEF-based one, in terms of the tone mapped image quality index (TMQI).</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be presented in APSIPA ASC 2024</p></details> | None |

The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page | None |

However, due to the limitations of imaging equipment and considerations for patient safety, the quality of medical images is usually limited, leading to sub-optimal fusion performance, and affecting the depth of image analysis by the physician. Thus, there is an urgent need for a technology that can both enhance image resolution and integrate multi-modal information. Although current image processing methods can effectively address image fusion and super-resolution individually, solving both problems synchronously remains extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose TFS-Diff, a simultaneously realize tri-modal medical image fusion and super-resolution model.

Specifically, SEA utilizes universal segmentation models, capable of handling diverse images and classes, to predict segmentation outputs from fused images and compare these outputs with segmentation labels. Our evaluation of recent VIF methods using SEA reveals that their performance is comparable or even inferior to using visible images only, despite nearly half of the infrared images demonstrating better performance than visible images. Further analysis indicates that the two metrics most correlated to our SEA are the gradient-based fusion metric $Q_{\text{ABF}}$ and the visual information fidelity metric $Q_{\text{VIFF}}$ in conventional VIF evaluation metrics, which can serve as proxies when segmentation labels are unavailable.

Therefore, extending depth of field (EDoF) is a fundamental task for meeting the requirements of emerging visual applications. To solve this task, the common practice is using multi-focus images from a single viewpoint. This method can obtain acceptable quality of EDoF under the condition of fixed field of view, but it is only applicable to static scenes and the field of view is limited and fixed. An emerging data type, varifocal multiview images have the potential to become a new paradigm for solving the EDoF, because the data contains more field of view information than multi-focus images.

However, existing fusion methods encounter challenges such as unknown degradation parameters, incomplete exploitation of the correlation between high-dimensional structures and deep image features. To overcome these issues, in this article, an unsupervised blind fusion method for hyperspectral and multispectral images based on Tucker decomposition and spatial spectral manifold learning (DTDNML) is proposed. We design a novel deep Tucker decomposition network that maps LR-HSI and HR-MSI into a consistent feature space, achieving reconstruction through decoders with shared parameter. To better exploit and fuse spatial-spectral features in the data, we design a core tensor fusion network that incorporates a spatial spectral attention mechanism for aligning and fusing features at different scales.

However, due to the significant differences between the two modalities, preserving key features during the fusion process remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a dual-branch feature decomposition fusion network (DAF-Net) with domain adaptive, which introduces Multi-Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK-MMD) into the base encoder and designs a hybrid kernel function suitable for infrared and visible image fusion. The base encoder built on the Restormer network captures global structural information while the detail encoder based on Invertible Neural Networks (INN) focuses on extracting detail texture information. By incorporating MK-MMD, the DAF-Net effectively aligns the latent feature spaces of visible and infrared images, thereby improving the quality of the fused images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques across multiple datasets, significantly enhancing both visual quality and fusion performance.

We argue the current feature-level fusion strategy is prone to semantic inconsistencies and misalignments across various imaging modalities because it merges features at intermediate layers in a neural network without evaluative control. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel image-level fusion based multi-modality medical image segmentation method, Fuse4Seg, which is a bi-level learning framework designed to model the intertwined dependencies between medical image segmentation and medical image fusion. The image-level fusion process is seamlessly employed to guide and enhance the segmentation results through a layered optimization approach. Besides, the knowledge gained from the segmentation module can effectively enhance the fusion module. This ensures that the resultant fused image is a coherent representation that accurately amalgamates information from all modalities. Moreover, we construct a BraTS-Fuse benchmark based on BraTS dataset, which includes 2040 paired original images, multi-modal fusion images, and ground truth. This benchmark not only serves image-level medical segmentation but is also the largest dataset for medical image fusion to date. Extensive experiments on several public datasets and our benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our approach over prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce an image fusion method, Hierarchical Perception Fusion (HPFusion), which leverages Large Vision-Language Model to incorporate hierarchical human semantic priors, preserving complementary information that satisfies human visual system. We propose multiple questions that humans focus on when viewing an image pair, and answers are generated via the Large Vision-Language Model according to images. The texts of answers are encoded into the fusion network, and the optimization also aims to guide the human semantic distribution of the fused image more similarly to source images, exploring complementary information within the human perception domain.

Many end-to-end specialized models based on deep learning (DL) have been proposed, yet the scale and performance of these models are limited by the size of dataset. Given the superior parameter scales and feature representations of pre-trained models, they exhibit outstanding performance when transferred to downstream tasks with small datasets. Therefore, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method, namely PanAdapter, which utilizes additional advanced semantic information from pre-trained models to alleviate the issue of small-scale datasets in pansharpening tasks. Specifically, targeting the large domain discrepancy between image restoration and pansharpening tasks, the PanAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy for progressively adapting to the downstream task. In the first stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN model and extract task-specific priors at two scales by proposed Local Prior Extraction (LPE) module. In the second stage, we feed the extracted two-scale priors into two branches of cascaded adapters respectively. At each adapter, we design two parameter-efficient modules for allowing the two branches to interact and be injected into the frozen pre-trained VisionTransformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that by only training the proposed LPE modules and adapters with a small number of parameters, our approach can benefit from pre-trained image restoration models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark pansharpening datasets. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |  | None |

These innovations significantly reduce the model's computational cost, including the number of parameters and inference latency, while maintaining or even enhancing the quality of the fused images. Comparative experiments using the M3FD dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only outperforms similar image fusion methods in terms of fusion quality but also offers a more resource-efficient solution suitable for deployment on embedded devices.

However, due to the heavy reliance on deep learning technologies, particularly for future connected and autonomous driving, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that pose significant safety risks to both personal and public transportation. Notably, researchers recently identified a new attack vector to deceive sign recognition systems: projecting well-designed adversarial light patches onto traffic signs. In comparison with traditional adversarial stickers or graffiti, these emerging light patches exhibit heightened aggression due to their ease of implementation and outstanding stealthiness. To effectively counter this security threat, we propose a universal image inpainting mechanism, namely, SafeSign. It relies on attention-enabled multi-view image fusion to repair traffic signs contaminated by adversarial light patches, thereby ensuring the accurate sign recognition. Here, we initially explore the fundamental impact of malicious light patches on the local and global feature spaces of authentic traffic signs. Then, we design a binary mask-based U-Net image generation pipeline outputting diverse contaminated sign patterns, to provide our image inpainting model with needed training data. Following this, we develop an attention mechanism-enabled neural network to jointly utilize the complementary information from multi-view images to repair contaminated signs. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate SafeSign's effectiveness in resisting potential light patch-based attacks, bringing an average accuracy improvement of 54.8% in three widely-used sign recognition models</p></details> |  | None |

Exploit Linear Transformer-Mamba Network for Multi-Modality Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03223v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modality image fusion aims to integrate the merits of images from different sources and render high-quality fusion images. However, existing feature extraction and fusion methods are either constrained by inherent local reduction bias and static parameters during inference (CNN) or limited by quadratic computational complexity (Transformers), and cannot effectively extract and fuse features. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-branch image fusion network called Tmamba. It consists of linear Transformer and Mamba, which has global modeling capabilities while maintaining linear complexity. Due to the difference between the Transformer and Mamba structures, the features extracted by the two branches carry channel and position information respectively. T-M interaction structure is designed between the two branches, using global learnable parameters and convolutional layers to transfer position and channel information respectively. We further propose cross-modal interaction at the attention level to obtain cross-modal attention. Experiments show that our Tmamba achieves promising results in multiple fusion tasks, including infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion. Code with checkpoints will be available after the peer-review process.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfolding fusion methods integrate the powerful representation capabilities of deep learning with the robustness of model-based approaches. These techniques involve unrolling the steps of the optimization scheme derived from the minimization of an energy into a deep learning framework, resulting in efficient and highly interpretable architectures. In this paper, we propose a model-based deep unfolded method for satellite image fusion. Our approach is based on a variational formulation that incorporates the classic observation model for MS/HS data, a high-frequency injection constraint based on the PAN image, and an arbitrary convex prior. For the unfolding stage, we introduce upsampling and downsampling layers that use geometric information encoded in the PAN image through residual networks. The backbone of our method is a multi-head attention residual network (MARNet), which replaces the proximity operator in the optimization scheme and combines multiple head attentions with residual learning to exploit image self-similarities via nonlocal operators defined in terms of patches. Additionally, we incorporate a post-processing module based on the MARNet architecture to further enhance the quality of the fused images. Experimental results on PRISMA, Quickbird, and WorldView2 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method and its ability to generalize across different sensor configurations and varying spatial and spectral resolutions.

Although State-Space Models, such as Mamba, are proficient in long-range modeling with linear complexity, most Mamba-based approaches use fixed scanning strategies, which can introduce biased prior information. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Bayesian-inspired scanning strategy called Random Shuffle, supplemented by an theoretically-feasible inverse shuffle to maintain information coordination invariance, aiming to eliminate biases associated with fixed sequence scanning. Based on this transformation pair, we customized the Shuffle Mamba Framework, penetrating modality-aware information representation and cross-modality information interaction across spatial and channel axes to ensure robust interaction and an unbiased global receptive field for multi-modal image fusion. Furthermore, we develop a testing methodology based on Monte-Carlo averaging to ensure the model's output aligns more closely with expected results. Extensive experiments across multiple multi-modal image fusion tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, yielding excellent fusion quality over state-of-the-art alternatives.

Thermal radiation information is mainly expressed through image intensities, while texture details are typically expressed through image gradients. However, existing dual-discriminator generative adversarial networks (GANs) often rely on two structurally identical discriminators for learning, which do not fully account for the distinct learning needs of infrared and visible image information. To this end, this paper proposes a novel GAN with a heterogeneous dual-discriminator network and an attention-based fusion strategy (GAN-HA). Specifically, recognizing the intrinsic differences between infrared and visible images, we propose, for the first time, a novel heterogeneous dual-discriminator network to simultaneously capture thermal radiation information and texture details. The two discriminators in this network are structurally different, including a salient discriminator for infrared images and a detailed discriminator for visible images. They are able to learn rich image intensity information and image gradient information, respectively. In addition, a new attention-based fusion strategy is designed in the generator to appropriately emphasize the learned information from different source images, thereby improving the information representation ability of the fusion result. In this way, the fused images generated by GAN-HA can more effectively maintain both the salience of thermal targets and the sharpness of textures. Extensive experiments on various public datasets demonstrate the superiority of GAN-HA over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms while showcasing its higher potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the prevailing focus has predominantly been on the architecture design, rather than the training strategies. As a low-level vision task, image fusion is supposed to quickly deliver output images for observation and supporting downstream tasks. Thus, superfluous computational and storage overheads should be avoided. In this work, a lightweight Distilled Mini-Model with a Dynamic Refresh strategy (MMDRFuse) is proposed to achieve this objective. To pursue model parsimony, an extremely small convolutional network with a total of 113 trainable parameters (0.44 KB) is obtained by three carefully designed supervisions. First, digestible distillation is constructed by emphasising external spatial feature consistency, delivering soft supervision with balanced details and saliency for the target network. Second, we develop a comprehensive loss to balance the pixel, gradient, and perception clues from the source images. Third, an innovative dynamic refresh training strategy is used to collaborate history parameters and current supervision during training, together with an adaptive adjust function to optimise the fusion network. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits promising advantages in terms of model efficiency and complexity, with superior performance in multiple image fusion tasks and downstream pedestrian detection application.

However, two major stumbling blocks hinder the development, including pixel misalignment and inefficient inference. Reliance on aligned image pairs in existing methods causes susceptibility to artifacts due to device motion. Additionally, existing techniques often rely on handcrafted architectures with huge network engineering, resulting in redundant parameters, adversely impacting inference efficiency and flexibility. To mitigate these limitations, this study introduces an architecture search-based paradigm incorporating self-alignment and detail repletion modules for robust multi-exposure image fusion. Specifically, targeting the extreme discrepancy of exposure, we propose the self-alignment module, leveraging scene relighting to constrain the illumination degree for following alignment and feature extraction. Detail repletion is proposed to enhance the texture details of scenes. Additionally, incorporating a hardware-sensitive constraint, we present the fusion-oriented architecture search to explore compact and efficient networks for fusion. The proposed method outperforms various competitive schemes, achieving a noteworthy 3.19\% improvement in PSNR for general scenarios and an impressive 23.5\% enhancement in misaligned scenarios. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference time by 69.1\%.

However, current models struggle to efficiently segment densely packed elements in such scenes, due to the absence of comprehensive fusion features that can guide mid-process fine-tuning and focus attention on relevant areas. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a transformative segmentation method. It provides more effective prompts through its flexible prompt encoder, compared to transformers lacking fine-tuned control. Nevertheless, SAM has not been extensively studied in the domain of multimodal fusion for natural images. In this paper, we introduce SAM into multimodal image segmentation for the first time, proposing a novel framework that combines Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) modules to enhance SAM's multimodal fusion and segmentation capabilities. Specifically, we first obtain latent space features of the two modalities through vector quantization and embed them into a cross-attention-based inter-domain fusion module to establish long-range dependencies between modalities. Then, we use these comprehensive fusion features as prompts to guide precise pixel-level segmentation. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms SAM and SAM2 in multimodal autonomous driving scenarios, achieving at least 3.9$\%$ higher segmentation mIoU than the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

This has driven the development of numerous methods to explore better ways of fusing them while preserving their respective characteristics.Mamba, as a state space model, has emerged in the field of natural language processing. Recently, many studies have attempted to extend Mamba to vision tasks. However, due to the nature of images different from causal language sequences, the limited state capacity of Mamba weakens its ability to model image information. Additionally, the sequence modeling ability of Mamba is only capable of spatial information and cannot effectively capture the rich spectral information in images. Motivated by these challenges, we customize and improve the vision Mamba network designed for the image fusion task. Specifically, we propose the local-enhanced vision Mamba block, dubbed as LEVM. The LEVM block can improve local information perception of the network and simultaneously learn local and global spatial information. Furthermore, we propose the state sharing technique to enhance spatial details and integrate spatial and spectral information. Finally, the overall network is a multi-scale structure based on vision Mamba, called LE-Mamba. Extensive experiments show the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results on multispectral pansharpening and multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Historically, most methodologies have predominantly utilized spatial domain recovery, offering limited consideration to the potentialities of the frequency domain. Additionally, there has been a lack of a unified perspective towards low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, complicating and impeding the optimization of image processing. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology that leverages the frequency domain to improve and unify the handling of exposure correction tasks. Our method introduces Holistic Frequency Attention and Dynamic Frequency Feed-Forward Network, which replace conventional correlation computation in the spatial-domain. They form a foundational building block that facilitates a U-shaped Holistic Dynamic Frequency Transformer as a filter to extract global information and dynamically select important frequency bands for image restoration. Complementing this, we employ a Laplacian pyramid to decompose images into distinct frequency bands, followed by multiple restorers, each tuned to recover specific frequency-band information. The pyramid fusion allows a more detailed and nuanced image restoration process. Ultimately, our structure unifies the three tasks of low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, enabling comprehensive treatment of all classical exposure errors. Benchmarking on mainstream datasets for these tasks, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, paving the way for more sophisticated and unified solutions in exposure correction.</p></details> |  | None |

To tackle the problem of insufficient feature extraction and lack of semantic awareness for complex scenes, this paper focuses on how to model correlation-driven decomposing features and reason high-level graph representation by efficiently extracting complementary features and multi-guided feature aggregation. We propose a three-branch encoder-decoder architecture along with corresponding fusion layers as the fusion strategy. The transformer with Multi-Dconv Transposed Attention and Local-enhanced Feed Forward network is used to extract shallow features after the depthwise convolution. In the three parallel branches encoder, Cross Attention and Invertible Block (CAI) enables to extract local features and preserve high-frequency texture details. Base feature extraction module (BFE) with residual connections can capture long-range dependency and enhance shared-modality expression capabilities. Graph Reasoning Module (GR) is introduced to reason high-level cross-modality relations and extract low-level details features as CAI's specific-modality complementary information simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our method has obtained competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in visible/infrared image fusion and medical image fusion tasks. Moreover, we surpass other fusion methods in terms of subsequent tasks, averagely scoring 8.27% mAP@0.5 higher in object detection and 5.85% mIoU higher in semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous VIF methods usually employ a color space transformation to keep the hue and saturation from the original visible image. However, for fast VIF methods, this operation accounts for the majority of the calculation and is the bottleneck preventing faster processing. In this paper, we propose a fast fusion method, FCDFusion, with little color deviation. It preserves color information without color space transformations, by directly operating in RGB color space. It incorporates gamma correction at little extra cost, allowing color and contrast to be rapidly improved. We regard the fusion process as a scaling operation on 3D color vectors, greatly simplifying the calculations. A theoretical analysis and experiments show that our method can achieve satisfactory results in only 7 FLOPs per pixel. Compared to state-of-the-art fast, color-preserving methods using HSV color space, our method provides higher contrast at only half of the computational cost. We further propose a new metric, color deviation, to measure the ability of a VIF method to preserve color. It is specifically designed for VIF tasks with color visible-light images, and overcomes deficiencies of existing VIF metrics used for this purpose.

Existing deep learning-based approaches insufficiently focus on retinal image fusion, and thus fail to preserve enough anatomical structure and fine vessel details in retinal image fusion. To address this, we propose the Topology-Aware Graph Attention Network (TaGAT) for multi-modal retinal image fusion, leveraging a novel Topology-Aware Encoder (TAE) with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to effectively enhance spatial features with retinal vasculature's graph topology across modalities.

However, the existing task-driven methods fail to address the domain gap between semantic and geometric representation. To overcome these issues, we propose a high-level vision task-driven infrared and visible image fusion network via semantic and geometric domain transformation, terms as HSFusion. Specifically, to minimize the gap between semantic and geometric representation, we design two separate domain transformation branches by CycleGAN framework, and each includes two processes: the forward segmentation process and the reverse reconstruction process. CycleGAN is capable of learning domain transformation patterns, and the reconstruction process of CycleGAN is conducted under the constraint of these patterns. Thus, our method can significantly facilitate the integration of semantic and geometric information and further reduces the domain gap. In fusion stage, we integrate the infrared and visible features that extracted from the reconstruction process of two seperate CycleGANs to obtain the fused result. These features, containing varying proportions of semantic and geometric information, can significantly enhance the high level vision tasks. Additionally, we generate masks based on segmentation results to guide the fusion task. These masks can provide semantic priors, and we design adaptive weights for two distinct areas in the masks to facilitate image fusion. Finally, we conducted comparative experiments between our method and eleven other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our approach surpasses others in both visual appeal and semantic segmentation task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the existing fusion algorithms tend to symmetrically fuse the multi-modal images, causing the loss of shallow information or bias towards a single modality in certain regions of the fusion results. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution differences of information in different modalities and proved that encoding features within the same network is not conducive to achieving simultaneous deep feature space alignment for multi-modal images. To overcome this issue, a Multi-Modal Asymmetric UNet (MMA-UNet) was proposed. We separately trained specialized feature encoders for different modal and implemented a cross-scale fusion strategy to maintain the features from different modalities within the same representation space, ensuring a balanced information fusion process. Furthermore, extensive fusion and downstream task experiments were conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of MMA-UNet in fusing infrared and visible image information, producing visually natural and semantically rich fusion results. Its performance surpasses that of the state-of-the-art comparison fusion methods.</p></details> |  | None |
