It is generally difficult to quantitatively and authoritatively evaluate the quality of synthetic images; however, in mission-critical biomedical scenarios robust evaluation is paramount. In this work, all practical image-to-image comparisons really are relative qualifications, not absolute difference quantifications; and, therefore, meaningful evaluation of generated image quality can be accomplished using the Tversky Index, which is a well-established measure for assessing perceptual similarity. This evaluation procedure is developed and then demonstrated using multiple image data sets, both real and simulated. The main result is that when the subjectivity and intrinsic deficiencies of any feature-encoding choice are put upfront, Tversky's method leads to intuitive results, whereas traditional methods based on summarizing distances in deep feature spaces do not.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages.

| **[TULIP: Token-length Upgraded CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10034v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of representing long captions in vision-language models, such as CLIP. By design these models are limited by fixed, absolute positional encodings, restricting inputs to a maximum of 77 tokens and hindering performance on tasks requiring longer descriptions. Although recent work has attempted to overcome this limit, their proposed approaches struggle to model token relationships over longer distances and simply extend to a fixed new token length. Instead, we propose a generalizable method, named TULIP, able to upgrade the token length to any length for CLIP-like models. We do so by improving the architecture with relative position encodings, followed by a training procedure that (i) distills the original CLIP text encoder into an encoder with relative position encodings and (ii) enhances the model for aligning longer captions with images. By effectively encoding captions longer than the default 77 tokens, our model outperforms baselines on cross-modal tasks such as retrieval and text-to-image generation.

| **[CoRPA: Adversarial Image Generation for Chest X-rays Using Concept Vector Perturbations and Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05214v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for medical image classification tasks are becoming widely implemented in AI-assisted diagnostic tools, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce clinician workloads, and improve patient outcomes. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Meta-LoRA: Meta-Learning LoRA Components for Domain-Aware ID Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22352v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image generative models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing high-quality images from textual prompts. However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that Meta-LoRA achieves superior identity retention, computational efficiency, and adaptability across diverse identity conditions. The code, model weights, and dataset will be released publicly upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Intrinsic Image Decomposition for Robust Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation on Reflective Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22209v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SSMDE) has gained attention in the field of deep learning as it estimates depth without requiring ground truth depth maps. This approach typically uses a photometric consistency loss between a synthesized image, generated from the estimated depth, and the original image, thereby reducing the need for extensive dataset acquisition. However, the conventional photometric consistency loss relies on the Lambertian assumption, which often leads to significant errors when dealing with reflective surfaces that deviate from this model. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates intrinsic image decomposition into SSMDE. Our method synergistically trains for both monocular depth estimation and intrinsic image decomposition. The accurate depth estimation facilitates multi-image consistency for intrinsic image decomposition by aligning different view coordinate systems, while the decomposition process identifies reflective areas and excludes corrupted gradients from the depth training process. Furthermore, our framework introduces a pseudo-depth generation and knowledge distillation technique to further enhance the performance of the student model across both reflective and non-reflective surfaces. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing SSMDE baselines in depth prediction, especially on reflective surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ORIGEN: Zero-Shot 3D Orientation Grounding in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22194v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ORIGEN, the first zero-shot method for 3D orientation grounding in text-to-image generation across multiple objects and diverse categories. While previous work on spatial grounding in image generation has mainly focused on 2D positioning, it lacks control over 3D orientation. To address this, we propose a reward-guided sampling approach using a pretrained discriminative model for 3D orientation estimation and a one-step text-to-image generative flow model. While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for reward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism. Instead, we adopt a sampling-based approach using Langevin dynamics, which extends gradient ascent by simply injecting random noise--requiring just a single additional line of code. Additionally, we introduce adaptive time rescaling based on the reward function to accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that ORIGEN outperforms both training-based and test-time guidance methods across quantitative metrics and user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://origen2025.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[Sell It Before You Make It: Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Personalized AI-Generated Items](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22182v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce has revolutionized retail, yet its traditional workflows remain inefficient, with significant time and resource costs tied to product design and manufacturing inventory. This paper introduces a novel system deployed at Alibaba that leverages AI-generated items (AIGI) to address these challenges with personalized text-to-image generation for e-commercial product design. AIGI enables an innovative business mode called "sell it before you make it", where merchants can design fashion items and generate photorealistic images with digital models based on textual descriptions. Only when the items have received a certain number of orders, do the merchants start to produce them, which largely reduces reliance on physical prototypes and thus accelerates time to market. For such a promising application, we identify the underlying key scientific challenge, i.e., capturing the users' group-level personalized preferences towards multiple generated candidate images. To this end, we propose a Personalized Group-Level Preference Alignment Framework for Diffusion Models (i.e., PerFusion). We first design PerFusion Reward Model for user preference estimation with a feature-crossing-based personalized plug-in. Then we develop PerFusion with a personalized adaptive network to model diverse preferences across users, and meanwhile derive the group-level preference optimization objective to capture the comparative behaviors among multiple candidates. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The AI-generated items have achieved over 13% relative improvements for both click-through rate and conversion rate compared to their human-designed counterparts, validating the revolutionary potential of AI-generated items for e-commercial platforms.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[An Empirical Study of Validating Synthetic Data for Text-Based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22171v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data plays a pivotal role in Text-Based Person Retrieval (TBPR) research. Mainstream research paradigm necessitates real-world person images with manual textual annotations for training models, posing privacy-sensitive and labor-intensive issues. Several pioneering efforts explore synthetic data for TBPR but still rely on real data, keeping the aforementioned issues and also resulting in diversity-deficient issue in synthetic datasets, thus impacting TBPR performance. Moreover, these works tend to explore synthetic data for TBPR through limited perspectives, leading to exploration-restricted issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of synthetic data for TBPR, highlighting three key aspects. (1) We propose an inter-class image generation pipeline, in which an automatic prompt construction strategy is introduced to guide generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in generating various inter-class images without reliance on original data. (2) We develop an intra-class image augmentation pipeline, in which the generative AI models are applied to further edit the images for obtaining various intra-class images. (3) Building upon the proposed pipelines and an automatic text generation pipeline, we explore the effectiveness of synthetic data in diverse scenarios through extensive experiments. Additionally, we experimentally investigate various noise-robust learning strategies to mitigate the inherent noise in synthetic data. We will release the code, along with the synthetic large-scale dataset generated by our pipelines, which are expected to advance practical TBPR research.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures | None |
| **[Spatial Transport Optimization by Repositioning Attention Map for Training-Free Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22168v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have recently excelled in high-quality image generation, particularly in a training-free manner, enabling cost-effective adaptability and generalization across diverse tasks. However, while the existing methods have been continuously focusing on several challenges, such as "missing objects" and "mismatched attributes," another critical issue of "mislocated objects" remains where generated spatial positions fail to align with text prompts. Surprisingly, ensuring such seemingly basic functionality remains challenging in popular T2I models due to the inherent difficulty of imposing explicit spatial guidance via text forms. To address this, we propose STORM (Spatial Transport Optimization by Repositioning Attention Map), a novel training-free approach for spatially coherent T2I synthesis. STORM employs Spatial Transport Optimization (STO), rooted in optimal transport theory, to dynamically adjust object attention maps for precise spatial adherence, supported by a Spatial Transport (ST) Cost function that enhances spatial understanding. Our analysis shows that integrating spatial awareness is most effective in the early denoising stages, while later phases refine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STORM surpasses existing methods, effectively mitigating mislocated objects while improving missing and mismatched attributes, setting a new benchmark for spatial alignment in T2I synthesis.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |
| **[Diffusion-4K: Ultra-High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18352v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present Diffusion-4K, a novel framework for direct ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using text-to-image diffusion models. The core advancements include: (1) Aesthetic-4K Benchmark: addressing the absence of a publicly available 4K image synthesis dataset, we construct Aesthetic-4K, a comprehensive benchmark for ultra-high-resolution image generation. We curated a high-quality 4K dataset with carefully selected images and captions generated by GPT-4o. Additionally, we introduce GLCM Score and Compression Ratio metrics to evaluate fine details, combined with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics and CLIPScore for a comprehensive assessment of ultra-high-resolution images. (2) Wavelet-based Fine-tuning: we propose a wavelet-based fine-tuning approach for direct training with photorealistic 4K images, applicable to various latent diffusion models, demonstrating its effectiveness in synthesizing highly detailed 4K images. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves impressive performance in high-quality image synthesis and text prompt adherence, especially when powered by modern large-scale diffusion models (e.g., SD3-2B and Flux-12B). Extensive experimental results from our benchmark demonstrate the superiority of Diffusion-4K in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[JoyType: A Robust Design for Multilingual Visual Text Creation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17524v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating images with accurately represented text, especially in non-Latin languages, poses a significant challenge for diffusion models. Existing approaches, such as the integration of hint condition diagrams via auxiliary networks (e.g., ControlNet), have made strides towards addressing this issue. However, diffusion models often fall short in tasks requiring controlled text generation, such as specifying particular fonts or producing text in small fonts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for multilingual visual text creation, named JoyType, designed to maintain the font style of text during the image generation process. Our methodology begins with assembling a training dataset, JoyType-1M, comprising 1 million pairs of data. Each pair includes an image, its description, and glyph instructions corresponding to the font style within the image. We then developed a text control network, Font ControlNet, tasked with extracting font style information to steer the image generation. To further enhance our model's ability to maintain font style, notably in generating small-font text, we incorporated a multi-layer OCR-aware loss into the diffusion process. This enhancement allows JoyType to direct text rendering using low-level descriptors. Our evaluations, based on both visual and accuracy metrics, demonstrate that JoyType significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, JoyType can function as a plugin, facilitating the creation of varied image styles in conjunction with other stable diffusion models on HuggingFace and CivitAI. Our project is open-sourced on https://jdh-algo.github.io/JoyType/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://jdh-algo.github.io/JoyType) |
| **[Improving the generalization of deep learning models in the segmentation of mammography images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22052v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mammography stands as the main screening method for detecting breast cancer early, enhancing treatment success rates. The segmentation of landmark structures in mammography images can aid the medical assessment in the evaluation of cancer risk and the image acquisition adequacy. We introduce a series of data-centric strategies aimed at enriching the training data for deep learning-based segmentation of landmark structures. Our approach involves augmenting the training samples through annotation-guided image intensity manipulation and style transfer to achieve better generalization than standard training procedures. These augmentations are applied in a balanced manner to ensure the model learns to process a diverse range of images generated by different vendor equipments while retaining its efficacy on the original data. We present extensive numerical and visual results that demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our methods when compared to the standard training. For this evaluation, we consider a large dataset that includes mammography images generated by different vendor equipments. Further, we present complementary results that show both the strengths and limitations of our methods across various scenarios. The accuracy and robustness demonstrated in the experiments suggest that our method is well-suited for integration into clinical practice.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harmonizing Visual Representations for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21979v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying visual understanding and generation within a single multimodal framework remains a significant challenge, as the two inherently heterogeneous tasks require representations at different levels of granularity. Current approaches that utilize vector quantization (VQ) or variational autoencoders (VAE) for unified visual representation prioritize intrinsic imagery features over semantics, compromising understanding performance. In this work, we take inspiration from masked image modelling (MIM) that learns rich semantics via a mask-and-reconstruct pre-training and its successful extension to masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. A preliminary study on the MAR encoder's representation reveals exceptional linear probing accuracy and precise feature response to visual concepts, which indicates MAR's potential for visual understanding tasks beyond its original generation role. Based on these insights, we present \emph{Harmon}, a unified autoregressive framework that harmonizes understanding and generation tasks with a shared MAR encoder. Through a three-stage training procedure that progressively optimizes understanding and generation capabilities, Harmon achieves state-of-the-art image generation results on the GenEval, MJHQ30K and WISE benchmarks while matching the performance of methods with dedicated semantic encoders (e.g., Janus) on image understanding benchmarks. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/wusize/Harmon.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/wusize/Harmon) |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models for Text-to-Image Generation through Autoregressive Representation Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07334v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training framework that unlocks global-coherent text-to-image generation in autoregressive LLMs without architectural changes. Unlike prior work that requires complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, <HYBNEXT>. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training from text-generation-only LLMs or random initialization, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet), and 7.5% (ImageNet) for advanced autoregressive LLMs like Chameleon and LlamaGen, all without framework modifications. For domain adaption, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). By demonstrating that training objective redesign -- not just architectural innovation -- can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges, ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models. Code and models will be released to advance autoregressive image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accelerate High-Quality Diffusion Models with Inner Loop Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13107v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), a novel approach to accelerate diffusion models' inference. ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The quality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP Image Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.

| **[Optimal Stepsize for Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21774v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality but suffer from computational intensive sampling due to suboptimal step discretization. While existing works focus on optimizing denoising directions, we address the principled design of stepsize schedules. This paper proposes Optimal Stepsize Distillation, a dynamic programming framework that extracts theoretically optimal schedules by distilling knowledge from reference trajectories. By reformulating stepsize optimization as recursive error minimization, our method guarantees global discretization bounds through optimal substructure exploitation. Crucially, the distilled schedules demonstrate strong robustness across architectures, ODE solvers, and noise schedules. Experiments show 10x accelerated text-to-image generation while preserving 99.4% performance on GenEval.

Lumina-Image 2.0 is built upon two key principles: (1) Unification - it adopts a unified architecture (Unified Next-DiT) that treats text and image tokens as a joint sequence, enabling natural cross-modal interactions and allowing seamless task expansion. Besides, since high-quality captioners can provide semantically well-aligned text-image training pairs, we introduce a unified captioning system, Unified Captioner (UniCap), specifically designed for T2I generation tasks. UniCap excels at generating comprehensive and accurate captions, accelerating convergence and enhancing prompt adherence. (2) Efficiency - to improve the efficiency of our proposed model, we develop multi-stage progressive training strategies and introduce inference acceleration techniques without compromising image quality. Extensive evaluations on academic benchmarks and public text-to-image arenas show that Lumina-Image 2.0 delivers strong performances even with only 2.6B parameters, highlighting its scalability and design efficiency.

The application areas of the bridge problem are enormous, among which the recent generative modeling (e.g., conditional or unconditional image generation) is the most popular. Also the famous Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem, a widely known problem for a century, is a special instance of the bridge problem. Two most popular algorithms to tackle the bridge problems in the deep learning era are: (conditional) flow matching and iterative fitting algorithms, where the former confined to ODE solutions, and the latter specifically for the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem. The main contribution of this article is in two folds: i) We provide concise reviews of these algorithms with technical details to some extent; ii) We propose a novel unified perspective and framework that subsumes these seemingly unrelated algorithms (and their variants) into one. In particular, we show that our unified framework can instantiate the Flow Matching (FM) algorithm, the (mini-batch) optimal transport FM algorithm, the (mini-batch) Schr\"{o}dinger bridge FM algorithm, and the deep Schr\"{o}dinger bridge matching (DSBM) algorithm as its special cases. We believe that this unified framework will be useful for viewing the bridge problems in a more general and flexible perspective, and in turn can help researchers and practitioners to develop new bridge algorithms in their fields.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CTRL-O: Language-Controllable Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21747v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-centric representation learning aims to decompose visual scenes into fixed-size vectors called "slots" or "object files", where each slot captures a distinct object. Current state-of-the-art object-centric models have shown remarkable success in object discovery in diverse domains, including complex real-world scenes. However, these models suffer from a key limitation: they lack controllability. Specifically, current object-centric models learn representations based on their preconceived understanding of objects, without allowing user input to guide which objects are represented. Introducing controllability into object-centric models could unlock a range of useful capabilities, such as the ability to extract instance-specific representations from a scene. In this work, we propose a novel approach for user-directed control over slot representations by conditioning slots on language descriptions. The proposed ConTRoLlable Object-centric representation learning approach, which we term CTRL-O, achieves targeted object-language binding in complex real-world scenes without requiring mask supervision. Next, we apply these controllable slot representations on two downstream vision language tasks: text-to-image generation and visual question answering. The proposed approach enables instance-specific text-to-image generation and also achieves strong performance on visual question answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Layer- and Timestep-Adaptive Differentiable Token Compression Ratios for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16822v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) image generation quality but suffer from high latency and memory inefficiency, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. One major efficiency bottleneck is that existing DiTs apply equal computation across all regions of an image. However, not all image tokens are equally important, and certain localized areas require more computation, such as objects. To address this, we propose DiffCR, a dynamic DiT inference framework with differentiable compression ratios, which automatically learns to dynamically route computation across layers and timesteps for each image token, resulting in efficient DiTs. Specifically, DiffCR integrates three features: (1) A token-level routing scheme where each DiT layer includes a router that is fine-tuned jointly with model weights to predict token importance scores. In this way, unimportant tokens bypass the entire layer's computation; (2) A layer-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where different DiT layers automatically learn varying compression ratios from a zero initialization, resulting in large compression ratios in redundant layers while others remain less compressed or even uncompressed; (3) A timestep-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where each denoising timestep learns its own compression ratio. The resulting pattern shows higher ratios for noisier timesteps and lower ratios as the image becomes clearer. Extensive experiments on text-to-image and inpainting tasks show that DiffCR effectively captures dynamism across token, layer, and timestep axes, achieving superior trade-offs between generation quality and efficiency compared to prior works.

| **[Improving Object Detection by Modifying Synthetic Data with Explainable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01477v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limited real-world data severely impacts model performance in many computer vision domains, particularly for samples that are underrepresented in training. Synthetically generated images are a promising solution, but 1) it remains unclear how to design synthetic training data to optimally improve model performance (e.g, whether and where to introduce more realism or more abstraction) and 2) the domain expertise, time and effort required from human operators for this design and optimisation process represents a major practical challenge. Here we propose a novel conceptual approach to improve the efficiency of designing synthetic images, by using robust Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to guide a human-in-the-loop process of modifying 3D mesh models used to generate these images. Importantly, this framework allows both modifications that increase and decrease realism in synthetic data, which can both improve model performance. We illustrate this concept using a real-world example where data are sparse; detection of vehicles in infrared imagery. We fine-tune an initial YOLOv8 model on the ATR DSIAC infrared dataset and synthetic images generated from 3D mesh models in the Unity gaming engine, and then use XAI saliency maps to guide modification of our Unity models. We show that synthetic data can improve detection of vehicles in orientations unseen in training by 4.6% (to mAP50 = 94.6%). We further improve performance by an additional 1.5% (to 96.1%) through our new XAI-guided approach, which reduces misclassifications through both increasing and decreasing the realism of different parts of the synthetic data. Our proof-of-concept results pave the way for fine, XAI-controlled curation of synthetic datasets tailored to improve object detection performance, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on human operators in designing and optimising these datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-free Diffusion Acceleration with Bottleneck Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18940v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual content generation but remain challenging to deploy due to their high computational cost during inference. This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tyfeld.github.io/BottleneckSampling.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://tyfeld.github.io/BottleneckSampling.github.io) |

If only a single reference image is available, it is difficult to isolate which specific elements should be transferred. However, using multiple reference images, the proposed approach distinguishes between common and unique features by selectively incorporating them into a generated output. By operating within a partially disentangled Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) embedding space (from IP-Adapter), our method enables the flexible transfer of texture, shape, motion, style, and more abstract conceptual transformations without requiring additional training or text prompts. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a diverse range of tasks, including style transfer, form metamorphosis, and conceptual transformations, showing how subtle or abstract attributes (e.g., brushstroke style, aerodynamic lines, and dynamism) can be seamlessly combined into a new image. In a user study, participants accurately recognized which features were intended to be transferred. Its simplicity, flexibility, and high-level control make Visual Concept Blending valuable for creative fields such as art, design, and content creation, where combining specific visual qualities from multiple inspirations is crucial.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing de-biasing techniques rely heavily on additional training, which imposes high computational costs and risks of compromising core image generation functionality. This hinders them from being widely adopted to real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Stable Diffusion's overlooked potential to reduce bias without requiring additional training. Through our analysis, we uncover that initial noises associated with minority attributes form "minority regions" rather than scattered. We view these "minority regions" as opportunities in SD to reduce bias. To unlock the potential, we propose a novel de-biasing method called 'weak guidance,' carefully designed to guide a random noise to the minority regions without compromising semantic integrity. Through analysis and experiments on various versions of SD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces bias without additional training, achieving both efficiency and preservation of core image generation functionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages; First two authors contributed equally; Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

UGen converts both texts and images into discrete token sequences and utilizes a single transformer to generate them uniformly in an autoregressive manner. To address the challenges associated with unified multimodal learning, UGen is trained using a novel mechanism, namely progressive vocabulary learning. In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite producing high-quality graphics and adequately receiving player input, existing models often fail to maintain fundamental game properties such as numerical and spatial consistency. Numerical consistency ensures gameplay mechanics correctly reflect score changes and other quantitative elements, while spatial consistency prevents jarring scene transitions, providing seamless player experiences. In this paper, we revisit the paradigm of generative games to explore what truly constitutes a Model as a Game (MaaG) with a well-developed mechanism. We begin with an empirical study on ``Traveler'', a 2D game created by an LLM featuring minimalist rules yet challenging generative models in maintaining consistency. Based on the DiT architecture, we design two specialized modules: (1) a numerical module that integrates a LogicNet to determine event triggers, with calculations processed externally as conditions for image generation; and (2) a spatial module that maintains a map of explored areas, retrieving location-specific information during generation and linking new observations to ensure continuity. Experiments across three games demonstrate that our integrated modules significantly enhance performance on consistency metrics compared to baselines, while incurring minimal time overhead during inference.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

| **[Towards Better Alignment: Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Against Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11240v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation. However, their practical applications are hindered by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle this issue, reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model fine-tuning. Yet, RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse reward, where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process. This makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process contribute positively to the final generated image, potentially leading to ineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end, this paper presents a novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when training diffusion models. Our framework, named $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$, employs two strategies: \textbf{B}ackward progressive training and \textbf{B}ranch-based sampling. For one thing, backward progressive training focuses initially on the final timesteps of denoising process and gradually extends the training interval to earlier timesteps, easing the learning difficulty from sparse rewards. For another, we perform branch-based sampling for each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch, we can identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute to the final image, which helps to learn effective policies instead of unnecessary ones. $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ is compatible with existing optimization algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ in improving prompt-image alignment and maintaining diversity in generated images.

We address these challenges through two key modules: 1) Janus-Pro-driven Prompt Parsing, a prompt-layout parsing module that bridges text understanding and layout generation via a compact 1B-parameter architecture, and 2) MIGLoRA, a parameter-efficient plug-in integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into UNet (SD1.5) and DiT (SD3) backbones. MIGLoRA is capable of preserving the base model's parameters and ensuring plug-and-play adaptability, minimizing architectural intrusion while enabling efficient fine-tuning. To support a comprehensive evaluation, we create DescripBox and DescripBox-1024, benchmarks that span diverse scenes and resolutions. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO and LVIS benchmarks while maintaining parameter efficiency, demonstrating superior layout fidelity and scalability for open-world synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by this success, we investigate whether video generators similarly exhibit 3D-awareness. Using structure-from-motion as a 3D-aware task, we test if intermediate features of a video generator - OpenSora in our case - can support camera pose estimation. Surprisingly, at first, we only find a weak correlation between the two tasks. Deeper investigation reveals that although the video generator produces plausible video frames, the frames themselves are not truly 3D-consistent. Instead, we propose to jointly train for the two tasks, using photometric generation and 3D aware errors. Specifically, we find that SoTA video generation and camera pose estimation (i.e.,DUSt3R [79]) networks share common structures, and propose an architecture that unifies the two. The proposed unified model, named \nameMethod, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality while producing 3D-consistent videos. In summary, we propose the first unified video generator that is 3D-consistent, generates realistic video frames, and can potentially be repurposed for other 3D-aware tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

These models jointly handle images, text, video, and audio for various tasks such as image captioning, question answering, and image generation. In this work, we explore discrete diffusion models as a unified generative formulation in the joint text and image domain, building upon their recent success in text generation. Discrete diffusion models offer several advantages over AR models, including improved control over quality versus diversity of generated samples, the ability to perform joint multimodal inpainting (across both text and image domains), and greater controllability in generation through guidance. Leveraging these benefits, we present the first Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion (UniDisc) model which is capable of jointly understanding and generating text and images for a variety of downstream tasks. We compare UniDisc to multimodal AR models, performing a scaling analysis and demonstrating that UniDisc outperforms them in terms of both performance and inference-time compute, enhanced controllability, editability, inpainting, and flexible trade-off between inference time and generation quality.

Recent diffusion distillation research has achieved excellent results for high-resolution text-to-image generation with methods such as phased consistency models (PCM) and improved distribution matching distillation (DMD2). However, these methods generally require many GPUs (e.g.~8-64) and significant batchsizes (e.g.~128-2048) during training, resulting in memory and compute requirements that are beyond the resources of some researchers. RAPM provides effective single-GPU diffusion distillation training with a batchsize of 1. The new method attempts to mimic the sampling trajectories of the teacher model by matching the relative and absolute positions. The design of relative positions is inspired by PCM. Two discriminators are introduced accordingly in RAPM, one for matching relative positions and the other for absolute positions. Experimental results on StableDiffusion (SD) V1.5 and SDXL indicate that RAPM with 4 timesteps produces comparable FID scores as the best method with 1 timestep under very limited computational resources.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data. In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG. We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component.

However, generating coherent, long-form text in images, such as paragraphs in slides or documents, remains a major challenge for current generative models. We present the first work specifically focused on long text image generation, addressing a critical gap in existing text-to-image systems that typically handle only brief phrases or single sentences. Through comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art autoregressive generation models, we identify the image tokenizer as a critical bottleneck in text generating quality. To address this, we introduce a novel text-focused, binary tokenizer optimized for capturing detailed scene text features. Leveraging our tokenizer, we develop \ModelName, a multimodal autoregressive model that excels in generating high-quality long-text images with unprecedented fidelity. Our model offers robust controllability, enabling customization of text properties such as font style, size, color, and alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ModelName~significantly outperforms SD3.5 Large~\cite{sd3} and GPT4o~\cite{gpt4o} with DALL-E 3~\cite{dalle3} in generating long text accurately, consistently, and flexibly.

To address these issues, in this study we introduce a novel framework, Indirect Prompt Gradient Optimization (IPGO), for prompt-level fine-tuning. IPGO enhances prompt embeddings by injecting continuously differentiable tokens at the beginning and end of the prompt embeddings, while exploiting low-rank benefits and flexibility from rotations. It allows for gradient-based optimization of injected tokens while enforcing value, orthonormality, and conformity constraints, facilitating continuous updates and empowering computational efficiency. To evaluate the performance of IPGO, we conduct prompt-wise and prompt-batch training with three reward models targeting image aesthetics, image-text alignment, and human preferences under three datasets of different complexity. The results show that IPGO consistently matches or outperforms cutting-edge benchmarks, including stable diffusion v1.5 with raw prompts, training-based approaches (DRaFT and DDPO), and training-free methods (DPO-Diffusion, Promptist, and ChatGPT-4o).

Although this evolution has significantly enhanced the models' ability to understand complex prompts and generate text, it also leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters. Despite T5 series encoders being trained on the C4 natural language corpus, which includes a significant amount of non-visual data, diffusion models with T5 encoder do not respond to those non-visual prompts, indicating redundancy in representational power. Therefore, it raises an important question: "Do we really need such a large text encoder?" In pursuit of an answer, we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models. To fully inherit its capabilities, we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality, semantic understanding, and text-rendering. Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL, while being 50 times smaller in size. This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3, making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Aesthetic Post-Training Diffusion Models from Generic Preferences with Step-by-step Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04314v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Meanwhile, within language, emotion plays a crucial role in expressing personal opinions in our daily lives and the inclusion of maliciously negative content can lead users astray, exacerbating negative emotions. Recognizing the success of diffusion models and the significance of emotion, we investigate a previously overlooked risk associated with text-to-image diffusion models, that is, utilizing emotion in the input texts to introduce negative content and provoke unfavorable emotions in users. Specifically, we identify a new backdoor attack, i.e., emotion-aware backdoor attack (EmoAttack), which introduces malicious negative content triggered by emotional texts during image generation. We formulate such an attack as a diffusion personalization problem to avoid extensive model retraining and propose the EmoBooth. Unlike existing personalization methods, our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model by establishing a mapping between a cluster of emotional words and a given reference image containing malicious negative content. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we built a dataset and conducted extensive analysis and discussion about its effectiveness. Given consumers' widespread use of diffusion models, uncovering this threat is critical for society.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods aimed at safeguarding artworks often employ adversarial attacks. However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability, high computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which compromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork. To address these limitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable Adversarial (SITA) attacks. SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss, which decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image. This disruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby impairing the overall stylization process. Importantly, SITA eliminates the need for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced computational overhead. The method's robust style feature disruption ensures high transferability across diverse models. Moreover, SITA introduces perturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of the image. This approach effectively protects against style extraction without compromising the visual quality of the artwork. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against unauthorized use in stylized generation. It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of transferability, computational efficiency, and noise imperceptibility.

To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, they still face slow generation speeds due to sequential denoising processes. To address this, a parallel sampling method based on Picard iteration was introduced, effectively reducing sequential steps while ensuring exact convergence to the original output. Nonetheless, Picard iteration does not guarantee faster convergence, which can still result in slow generation in practice. In this work, we propose a new parallelization scheme, the Picard Consistency Model (PCM), which significantly reduces the number of generation steps in Picard iteration. Inspired by the consistency model, PCM is directly trained to predict the fixed-point solution, or the final output, at any stage of the convergence trajectory. Additionally, we introduce a new concept called model switching, which addresses PCM's limitations and ensures exact convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCM achieves up to a 2.71x speedup over sequential sampling and a 1.77x speedup over Picard iteration across various tasks, including image generation and robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

While recent methods have attempted to address this limitation, they typically lack sufficient parameter and memory efficiency. We propose VectorFit, an effective and easily deployable approach that adaptively trains the singular vectors and biases of pre-trained weight matrices. We demonstrate that the utilization of structural and transformational characteristics of pre-trained weights enables high-rank updates comparable to those of full fine-tuning. As a result, VectorFit achieves superior performance with 9X less trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Through extensive experiments over 17 datasets spanning diverse language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we exhibit that VectorFit consistently outperforms baselines, even in extremely low-budget scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dissecting CLIP: Decomposition with a Schur Complement-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18645v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the alignment of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the relevance of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which is responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the \textit{Schur Complement Entropy (SCE)} score, a measure of the intrinsic diversity of a text-to-image model based on data collected with varying text prompts. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt in the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of embeddings on specific objects or properties for downstream tasks. We present several numerical results that apply our Schur complement-based approach to evaluate text-to-image models and modify CLIP image embeddings.

Existing GAN-based methods suffer from either distortions and visual artifacts or poor reconstruction quality, i.e., the background and several important appearance details, such as hair style/color, glasses and accessories, are not faithfully reconstructed. Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) enable the generation of high-quality realistic images. To this end, in this paper we present DiffusionAct, a novel method that leverages the photo-realistic image generation of diffusion models to perform neural face reenactment. Specifically, we propose to control the semantic space of a Diffusion Autoencoder (DiffAE), in order to edit the facial pose of the input images, defined as the head pose orientation and the facial expressions. Our method allows one-shot, self, and cross-subject reenactment, without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning. We compare against state-of-the-art GAN-, StyleGAN2-, and diffusion-based methods, showing better or on-par reenactment performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://stelabou.github.io/diffusionact/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://stelabou.github.io/diffusionact) |

Existing methods primarily focus on either facial synthesis or near-frontal body generation, with limited ability to simultaneously control key factors such as viewpoint, pose, clothing, and identity in a disentangled manner. In this paper, we introduce a new disentangled and controllable human synthesis task, which explicitly separates and manipulates these four factors within a unified framework. We first develop an end-to-end generative model trained on MVHumanNet for factor disentanglement. However, the domain gap between MVHumanNet and in-the-wild data produce unsatisfacotry results, motivating the exploration of virtual try-on (VTON) dataset as a potential solution. Through experiments, we observe that simply incorporating the VTON dataset as additional data to train the end-to-end model degrades performance, primarily due to the inconsistency in data forms between the two datasets, which disrupts the disentanglement process. To better leverage both datasets, we propose a stage-by-stage framework that decomposes human image generation into three sequential steps: clothed A-pose generation, back-view synthesis, and pose and view control. This structured pipeline enables better dataset utilization at different stages, significantly improving controllability and generalization, especially for in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our stage-by-stage approach outperforms end-to-end models in both visual fidelity and disentanglement quality, offering a scalable solution for real-world tasks.

Existing diffusion models struggle with scaling beyond their training resolutions, often leading to structural distortions or content repetition. Reference-based methods address the issues by upsampling a low-resolution reference to guide higher-resolution generation. However, they face significant challenges: upsampling in latent space often causes manifold deviation, which degrades output quality. On the other hand, upsampling in RGB space tends to produce overly smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, LSRNA combines Latent space Super-Resolution (LSR) for manifold alignment and Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance high-frequency details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art reference-based methods across various resolutions and metrics, while showing the critical role of latent space upsampling in preserving detail and sharpness.

However, if one asks the generator to synthesize a specific camera setting such as creating different fields of view using a 24mm lens versus a 70mm lens, the generator will not be able to interpret and generate scene-consistent images. This limitation not only hinders the adoption of generative tools in professional photography but also highlights the broader challenge of aligning data-driven models with real-world physical settings. In this paper, we introduce Generative Photography, a framework that allows controlling camera intrinsic settings during content generation. The core innovation of this work are the concepts of Dimensionality Lifting and Differential Camera Intrinsics Learning, enabling smooth and consistent transitions across different camera settings. Experimental results show that our method produces significantly more scene-consistent photorealistic images than state-of-the-art models such as Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.

While Unified Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, they struggle with contextual reasoning in T2I-ICL scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates a thought process called ImageGen-CoT prior to image generation. To avoid generating unstructured ineffective reasoning steps, we develop an automatic pipeline to curate a high-quality ImageGen-CoT dataset. We then fine-tune MLLMs using this dataset to enhance their contextual reasoning capabilities. To further enhance performance, we explore test-time scale-up strategies and propose a novel hybrid scaling approach. This approach first generates multiple ImageGen-CoT chains and then produces multiple images for each chain via sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, fine-tuning with the ImageGen-CoT dataset leads to a substantial 80\% performance gain for SEED-X on T2I-ICL tasks. See our project page at https://ImageGen-CoT.github.io/.

In this paper, we explore how to decode textual prompts from reference images, a process we refer to as image reverse prompt engineering. This technique enables us to gain insights from reference images, understand the creative processes of great artists, and generate impressive new images. To address this challenge, we propose a method known as automatic reverse prompt optimization (ARPO). Specifically, our method refines an initial prompt into a high-quality prompt through an iteratively imitative gradient prompt optimization process: 1) generating a recreated image from the current prompt to instantiate its guidance capability; 2) producing textual gradients, which are candidate prompts intended to reduce the difference between the recreated image and the reference image; 3) updating the current prompt with textual gradients using a greedy search method to maximize the CLIP similarity between prompt and reference image. We compare ARPO with several baseline methods, including handcrafted techniques, gradient-based prompt tuning methods, image captioning, and data-driven selection method. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our ARPO converges quickly to generate high-quality reverse prompts. More importantly, we can easily create novel images with diverse styles and content by directly editing these reverse prompts. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, restoring heavily distorted information under dense haze requires generative diffusion models, whose potential in dehazing remains underutilized partly due to their lengthy sampling processes. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel hazing-dehazing pipeline consisting of a Realistic Hazy Image Generation framework (HazeGen) and a Diffusion-based Dehazing framework (DiffDehaze). Specifically, HazeGen harnesses robust generative diffusion priors of real-world hazy images embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. By employing specialized hybrid training and blended sampling strategies, HazeGen produces realistic and diverse hazy images as high-quality training data for DiffDehaze. To alleviate the inefficiency and fidelity concerns associated with diffusion-based methods, DiffDehaze adopts an Accelerated Fidelity-Preserving Sampling process (AccSamp). The core of AccSamp is the Tiled Statistical Alignment Operation (AlignOp), which can provide a clean and faithful dehazing estimate within a small fraction of sampling steps to reduce complexity and enable effective fidelity guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior dehazing performance and visual quality of our approach over existing methods.

Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. To overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM synthesizes coherent histopathology images that remain contextually accurate and detailed at different zoom levels, achieving state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales and excelling in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to $4096 \times 4096$ pixels and $4\times$ super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment. Extensive experiments on three compositional text-to-image generation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of SILMM, showing improvements exceeding 30% on T2I-CompBench++ and around 20% on DPG-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera-ready.

A classic solution is text-to-image retrieval from an existing database; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have made it possible to produce attractive and counterfactual visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images. In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval, proposing a unified framework for both tasks with one single Large Multimodal Model (LMM). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of LMMs and introduce an efficient generative retrieval method for text-to-image retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval autoregressively and propose an autonomous decision mechanism to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text prompt. To standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval, we construct TIGeR-Bench, a benchmark spanning both creative and knowledge-intensive domains. Extensive experiments on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-ready</p></details> | None |

However, one of the primary failure modes of these text-to-image generative models is in composing attributes, objects, and their associated relationships accurately into an image. In our paper, we investigate compositional attribute binding failures, where the model fails to correctly associate descriptive attributes (such as color, shape, or texture) with the corresponding objects in the generated images, and highlight that imperfect text conditioning with CLIP text-encoder is one of the primary reasons behind the inability of these models to generate high-fidelity compositional scenes. In particular, we show that (i) there exists an optimal text-embedding space that can generate highly coherent compositional scenes showing that the output space of the CLIP text-encoder is sub-optimal, and (ii) the final token embeddings in CLIP are erroneous as they often include attention contributions from unrelated tokens in compositional prompts. Our main finding shows that significant compositional improvements can be achieved (without harming the model's FID score) by fine-tuning only a simple and parameter-efficient linear projection on CLIP's representation space in Stable-Diffusion variants using a small set of compositional image-text pairs.</p></details> |  | None |

While it is possible to generate an image with fixed colors by first creating an image from a text prompt and then applying a color style transfer method, this approach often results in semantically meaningless colors in the generated image. Our method solves this problem by modifying the sampling process of a diffusion model to incorporate the differentiable Sliced 1-Wasserstein distance between the color distribution of the generated image and the reference palette. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for color-conditional generation in terms of color similarity to the reference, producing images that not only match the reference colors but also maintain semantic coherence with the original text prompt.

Nonetheless, these strategies fail to generalize to novel styles and have technical constraints, particularly in terms of maximum output length and training efficiency. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a novel framework for text image generation, dubbed Emuru. Our approach leverages a powerful text image representation model (a variational autoencoder) combined with an autoregressive Transformer. Our approach enables the generation of styled text images conditioned on textual content and style examples, such as specific fonts or handwriting styles. We train our model solely on a diverse, synthetic dataset of English text rendered in over 100,000 typewritten and calligraphy fonts, which gives it the capability to reproduce unseen styles (both fonts and users' handwriting) in zero-shot. To the best of our knowledge, Emuru is the first autoregressive model for HTG, and the first designed specifically for generalization to novel styles. Moreover, our model generates images without background artifacts, which are easier to use for downstream applications. Extensive evaluation on both typewritten and handwritten, any-length text image generation scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPR2025 | None |

Models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in ensuring consistency within and across these modalities. To address these challenges, we present ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation. ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific. This multi-tiered evaluation allows for a nuanced assessment of consistency, coherence, and accuracy, and provides interpretable question-answer feedback. In conjunction with ISG, we introduce a benchmark, ISG-Bench, encompassing 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories. This benchmark dataset includes complex language-vision dependencies and golden answers to evaluate models effectively on vision-centric tasks such as style transfer, a challenging area for current models. Using ISG-Bench, we demonstrate that recent unified vision-language models perform poorly on generating interleaved content. While compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level, their performance remains suboptimal at both block and image levels. To facilitate future work, we develop ISG-Agent, a baseline agent employing a "plan-execute-refine" pipeline to invoke tools, achieving a 122% performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025 as Spotlight.

We propose a self-supervised learning approach where the system learns transformations independently by reconstructing images that have undergone previously unseen transformations. Specifically, the model is tasked to reconstruct intermediate transformed images, e.g. translated or rotated images, without prior knowledge of these transformations. This auxiliary task encourages the model to develop equivariance-coherent features without relying on predefined transformation rules. To this end, we apply transformations to the input image, generating an image pair, and then split the extracted features into two sets per image. One set is used with a usual SSL loss encouraging invariance, the other with our loss based on the auxiliary task to reconstruct the intermediate transformed images. Our loss and the SSL loss are linearly combined with weighted terms. Evaluating on synthetic tasks with natural images, our proposed method strongly outperforms all competitors, regardless of whether they are designed to learn equivariance. Furthermore, when trained alongside augmentation-based methods as the invariance tasks, such as iBOT or DINOv2, we successfully learn a balanced combination of invariant and equivariant features. Our approach performs strong on a rich set of realistic computer vision downstream tasks, almost always improving over all baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Resolution Generalization of Diffusion Transformers with Randomized Positional Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18719v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resolution generalization in image generation tasks enables the production of higher-resolution images with lower training resolution overhead. However, a significant challenge in resolution generalization, particularly in the widely used Diffusion Transformers, lies in the mismatch between the positional encodings encountered during testing and those used during training. While existing methods have employed techniques such as interpolation, extrapolation, or their combinations, none have fully resolved this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional randomized positional encodings (RPE-2D) framework that focuses on learning positional order of image patches instead of the specific distances between them, enabling seamless high- and low-resolution image generation without requiring high- and low-resolution image training. Specifically, RPE-2D independently selects positions over a broader range along both the horizontal and vertical axes, ensuring that all position encodings are trained during the inference phase, thus improving resolution generalization. Additionally, we propose a random data augmentation technique to enhance the modeling of position order. To address the issue of image cropping caused by the augmentation, we introduce corresponding micro-conditioning to enable the model to perceive the specific cropping patterns. On the ImageNet dataset, our proposed RPE-2D achieves state-of-the-art resolution generalization performance, outperforming existing competitive methods when trained at a resolution of $256 \times 256$ and inferred at $384 \times 384$ and $512 \times 512$, as well as when scaling from $512 \times 512$ to $768 \times 768$ and $1024 \times 1024$.

It is reported that these models tend to over-focus on certain irrelevant image tokens that do not contain critical information for answering the question and distort the output. To address this, we propose an Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention(IAVA) approach, which identifies irrelevant tokens by comparing changes in attention weights under two different instructions. By applying contrastive decoding, we dynamically adjust the logits generated from original image tokens and irrelevant image tokens, reducing the model's over-attention to irrelevant information. The experimental results demonstrate that IAVA consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques on benchmarks such as MME, POPE, and TextVQA in mitigating object hallucinations.

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona</p></details> | [Code Link](https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona) |
| **[MMO-IG: Multi-Class and Multi-Scale Object Image Generation for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13684v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of deep generative models (DGMs) has significantly advanced research in computer vision, providing a cost-effective alternative to acquiring vast quantities of expensive imagery. However, existing methods predominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with real images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS image object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs, termed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels from global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local view, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map (ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with iso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground instances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion models. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a spatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and reliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose a structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of synthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM together. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MMO-IG exhibits superior generation capabilities for RS images with dense MMO-supervised labels, and RS detectors pre-trained with MMO-IG show excellent performance on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing techniques addressing these issues for responsible T2I models aim for the generated content to be fair and safe (non-violent/explicit). However, these methods remain bounded to handling the facets of responsibility concepts individually, while also lacking in interpretability. Moreover, they often require alteration to the original model, which compromises the model performance. In this work, we propose a unique technique to enable responsible T2I generation by simultaneously accounting for an extensive range of concepts for fair and safe content generation in a scalable manner. The key idea is to distill the target T2I pipeline with an external plug-and-play mechanism that learns an interpretable composite responsible space for the desired concepts, conditioned on the target T2I pipeline. We use knowledge distillation and concept whitening to enable this. At inference, the learned space is utilized to modulate the generative content. A typical T2I pipeline presents two plug-in points for our approach, namely; the text embedding space and the diffusion model latent space. We develop modules for both points and show the effectiveness of our approach with a range of strong results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Flowing from Words to Pixels: A Noise-Free Framework for Cross-Modality Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15213v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, and their generalization, flow matching, have had a remarkable impact on the field of media generation. Here, the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion models, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly, for text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth estimation, and image super-resolution. We hope this paper contributes to accelerating progress in cross-modal media generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 camera-ready version.

| **[Multi-focal Conditioned Latent Diffusion for Person Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15686v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) has demonstrated strong capabilities in high-resolution image generation and has been widely employed for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS), yielding promising results. However, the compression process of LDM often results in the deterioration of details, particularly in sensitive areas such as facial features and clothing textures. In this paper, we propose a Multi-focal Conditioned Latent Diffusion (MCLD) method to address these limitations by conditioning the model on disentangled, pose-invariant features from these sensitive regions. Our approach utilizes a multi-focal condition aggregation module, which effectively integrates facial identity and texture-specific information, enhancing the model's ability to produce appearance realistic and identity-consistent images. Our method demonstrates consistent identity and appearance generation on the DeepFashion dataset and enables flexible person image editing due to its generation consistency.

These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness.

This development creates a series of societal risks, and challenges our perception of what is true and what is not, particularly with the emergence of "deep fakes" that impersonate real individuals. Watermarking, a technique that involves embedding identifying information within images to indicate their AI-generated nature, has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by AI-generated images. The implementation of watermarking techniques is now becoming a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, including under the new 2024 EU AI Act. Despite the widespread use of AI image generation systems, the current status of watermarking implementation remains largely unexamined. Moreover, the practical implications of the AI Act's watermarking requirements have not previously been studied. The present paper therefore both provides an empirical analysis of 50 of the most widely used AI systems for image generation, and embeds this empirical analysis into a legal analysis of the AI Act. We identify four categories of generative AI image systems relevant under the AI Act, outline the legal obligations for each category, and find that only a minority number of providers currently implement adequate watermarking practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, note that this work has not been published in a peer reviewed venue yet.

| **[TCFG: Tangential Damping Classifier-free Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18137v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image synthesis, largely attributed to the use of classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enables high-quality, condition-aligned image generation. CFG combines the conditional score (e.g., text-conditioned) with the unconditional score to control the output. However, the unconditional score is in charge of estimating the transition between manifolds of adjacent timesteps from $x_t$ to $x_{t-1}$, which may inadvertently interfere with the trajectory toward the specific condition. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a geometric perspective on the unconditional score to enhance CFG performance when conditional scores are available. Specifically, we propose a method that filters the singular vectors of both conditional and unconditional scores using singular value decomposition. This filtering process aligns the unconditional score with the conditional score, thereby refining the sampling trajectory to stay closer to the manifold. Our approach improves image quality with negligible additional computation. We provide deeper insights into the score function behavior in diffusion models and present a practical technique for achieving more accurate and contextually coherent image synthesis.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.81 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.96 through inference scaling with VILA-Judge, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible.

| **[An Image-like Diffusion Method for Human-Object Interaction Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18134v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-object interaction (HOI) detection often faces high levels of ambiguity and indeterminacy, as the same interaction can appear vastly different across different human-object pairs. Additionally, the indeterminacy can be further exacerbated by issues such as occlusions and cluttered backgrounds. To handle such a challenging task, in this work, we begin with a key observation: the output of HOI detection for each human-object pair can be recast as an image. Thus, inspired by the strong image generation capabilities of image diffusion models, we propose a new framework, HOI-IDiff. In HOI-IDiff, we tackle HOI detection from a novel perspective, using an Image-like Diffusion process to generate HOI detection outputs as images. Furthermore, recognizing that our recast images differ in certain properties from natural images, we enhance our framework with a customized HOI diffusion process and a slice patchification model architecture, which are specifically tailored to generate our recast ``HOI images''. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our framework.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC).

Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

| **[A new approach for encoding code and assisting code understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00521v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some companies (e.g., Microsoft Research and Google DeepMind) have discovered some of the limitations of GPTs' autoregressive paradigm next-word prediction, manifested in the model's lack of planning, working memory, backtracking, and reasoning skills. GPTs rely on a local and greedy process of generating the next word, without a global understanding of the task or the output. We have confirmed the above limitations through specialized empirical studies of code comprehension. Although GPT-4 is good at producing fluent and coherent text, it cannot handle complex logic and generate new code that hasn't been seen, and it relies too much on the formatting of the prompt to generate the correct code. We propose a new paradigm for code understanding that goes beyond the next-word prediction paradigm, inspired by the successful application of diffusion techniques to image generation (Dalle-2, Sora) and protein structure generation (AlphaFold-3), which have no autoregressive constraints. Instead of encoding the code in a form that mimics natural language, we encode the code as a heterogeneous image paradigm with a memory of global information that mimics both images and protein structures. We then refer to Sora's CLIP upstream text-to-image encoder model to design a text-to-code encoder model that can be applied to various downstream code understanding tasks. The model learns the global understanding of code under the new paradigm heterogeneous image, connects the encoding space of text and code, and encodes the input of text into the vector of code most similar to it. Using self-supervised comparative learning on 456,360 text-code pairs, the model achieved a zero-shot prediction of new data. This work is the basis for future work on code generation using diffusion techniques under a new paradigm to avoid autoregressive limitations.</p></details> | 10 page, 14 figures | None |

For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID) and the perceived truthfulness of generated images seem to suggest that we are nearing this goal. However, through distribution classification tasks, we reveal that, from the perspective of neural network-based classifiers, even advanced diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers are able to consistently and effortlessly distinguish real images from generated ones across various settings. Moreover, we uncover an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can easily differentiate between diffusion models with comparable performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to distinguish between models within the same family but of different scales (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL). Our methodology carries several important implications. First, it naturally serves as a diagnostic tool for diffusion models by analyzing specific features of generated data. Second, it sheds light on the model autophagy disorder and offers insights into the use of generated data: augmenting real data with generated data is more effective than replacing it. Third, classifier guidance can significantly enhance the realism of generated images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Building upon this insight, we carefully explore the design space of training and sampling, identifying key factors that contribute to both performance and efficiency. Based on the improvements observed during this exploration, we develop our model, referred to as eMIGM. Empirically, eMIGM demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet generation, as measured by Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, with similar number of function evaluations (NFEs) and model parameters, eMIGM outperforms the seminal VAR. Moreover, as NFE and model parameters increase, eMIGM achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models while requiring less than 40% of the NFE. Additionally, on ImageNet 512x512, with only about 60% of the NFE, eMIGM outperforms the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.

However, generating RGBA videos with alpha channels for transparency and visual effects remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable datasets and the complexity of adapting existing models for this purpose. To address these limitations, we present TransAnimate, an innovative framework that integrates RGBA image generation techniques with video generation modules, enabling the creation of dynamic and transparent videos. TransAnimate efficiently leverages pre-trained text-to-transparent image model weights and combines them with temporal models and controllability plugins trained on RGB videos, adapting them for controllable RGBA video generation tasks. Additionally, we introduce an interactive motion-guided control mechanism, where directional arrows define movement and colors adjust scaling, offering precise and intuitive control for designing game effects. To further alleviate data scarcity, we have developed a pipeline for creating an RGBA video dataset, incorporating high-quality game effect videos, extracted foreground objects, and synthetic transparent videos. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TransAnimate generates high-quality RGBA videos, establishing it as a practical and effective tool for applications in gaming and visual effects.</p></details> |  | None |

We use normalizing flows to parameterize the noisy data at any arbitrary step of the diffusion process and utilize it as the prior in the reverse diffusion process. More specifically, the forward noising process turns a data distribution into partially noisy data, which are subsequently transformed into a Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear process. The backward denoising procedure begins with a prior created by sampling from the Gaussian distribution and applying the invertible normalizing flow transformations deterministically. To generate the data distribution, the prior then undergoes the remaining diffusion stochastic denoising procedure. Through the reduction of the number of total diffusion steps, we are able to speed up both the forward and backward processes. More importantly, we improve the expressive power of diffusion models by employing both deterministic and stochastic mappings. Experiments on standard image generation datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, for example, we achieve an FID of 2.01 and an Inception score of 9.96.

To address this critical challenge, we propose FundusGAN, a novel hierarchical feature-aware generative framework specifically designed for high-fidelity fundus image synthesis. Our approach leverages a Feature Pyramid Network within its encoder to comprehensively extract multi-scale information, capturing both large anatomical structures and subtle pathological features. The framework incorporates a modified StyleGAN-based generator with dilated convolutions and strategic upsampling adjustments to preserve critical retinal structures while enhancing pathological detail representation. Comprehensive evaluations on the DDR, DRIVE, and IDRiD datasets demonstrate that FundusGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics (SSIM: 0.8863, FID: 54.2, KID: 0.0436 on DDR). Furthermore, disease classification experiments reveal that augmenting training data with FundusGAN-generated images significantly improves diagnostic accuracy across multiple CNN architectures (up to 6.49\% improvement with ResNet50). These results establish FundusGAN as a valuable foundation model component that effectively addresses data scarcity challenges in ophthalmological AI research, enabling more robust and generalizable diagnostic systems while reducing dependency on large-scale clinical data collection.</p></details> |  | None |

Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image.

The selection task is commonly addressed by identifying the model that maximizes an evaluation score based on the diversity and quality of the generated data. However, such a best-model identification approach overlooks the possibility that a mixture of available models can outperform each individual model. In this work, we numerically show that a mixture of generative models on benchmark image datasets can indeed achieve a better evaluation score (based on FID and KID scores), compared to the individual models. This observation motivates the development of efficient algorithms for selecting the optimal mixture of the models. To address this, we formulate a quadratic optimization problem to find an optimal mixture model achieving the maximum of kernel-based evaluation scores including kernel inception distance (KID) and R\'enyi kernel entropy (RKE). To identify the optimal mixture of the models using the fewest possible sample queries, we view the selection task as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and propose the Mixture Upper Confidence Bound (Mixture-UCB) algorithm that provably converges to the optimal mixture of the involved models. More broadly, the proposed Mixture-UCB can be extended to optimize every convex quadratic function of the mixture weights in a general MAB setting. We prove a regret bound for the Mixture-UCB algorithm and perform several numerical experiments to show the success of Mixture-UCB in finding the optimal mixture of text and image generative models.

However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area. We further design a simple LightControl to enhance the fidelity of instructional image editing. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, multifunctionality, and transferability of our X2I.

However, the intricate connections between nodes and diverse modules often present a steep learning curve for users. In this paper, we introduce ComfyGPT, the first self-optimizing multi-agent system designed to generate ComfyUI workflows based on task descriptions automatically. ComfyGPT comprises four specialized agents: ReformatAgent, FlowAgent, RefineAgent, and ExecuteAgent. The core innovation of ComfyGPT lies in two key aspects. First, it focuses on generating individual node links rather than entire workflows, significantly improving generation precision. Second, we proposed FlowAgent, a LLM-based workflow generation agent that uses both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve workflow generation accuracy. Moreover, we introduce FlowDataset, a large-scale dataset containing 13,571 workflow-description pairs, and FlowBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating workflow generation systems. We also propose four novel evaluation metrics: Format Validation (FV), Pass Accuracy (PA), Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA), and Pass Node Diversity (PND). Experimental results demonstrate that ComfyGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in workflow generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TDRI: Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation for Interactive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17669v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although text-to-image generation technologies have made significant advancements, they still face challenges when dealing with ambiguous prompts and aligning outputs with user intent.Our proposed framework, TDRI (Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation), addresses these issues by enhancing image generation through iterative user interaction. It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences</p></details> |  | None |

In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Diffusion Training through Parallelization with Truncated Karhunen-Loève Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17657v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion denoising models have become a popular approach for image generation, but they often suffer from slow convergence during training. In this paper, we identify that this slow convergence is partly due to the complexity of the Brownian motion driving the forward-time process. To address this, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, truncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel ordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL diffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By developing an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the integration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the widely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our modifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving the network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method significantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence speeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and ultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for highly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters, and can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | None |

Despite the discovery of thousands of inscriptions, a vast expanse of OBS remains undeciphered, casting a veil of mystery over this ancient language. The emergence of modern AI technologies presents a novel frontier for OBS decipherment, challenging traditional NLP methods that rely heavily on large textual corpora, a luxury not afforded by historical languages. This paper introduces a novel approach by adopting image generation techniques, specifically through the development of Oracle Bone Script Decipher (OBSD). Utilizing a conditional diffusion-based strategy, OBSD generates vital clues for decipherment, charting a new course for AI-assisted analysis of ancient languages. To validate its efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted on an oracle bone script dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of OBSD.

Reduced well-being is often linked to depression or anxiety disorders, which are characterised by biases in visual attention towards specific stimuli, such as human faces. This paper introduces a novel approach to AI-assisted screening of affective disorders by analysing visual attention scan paths using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Data were collected from two studies examining (1) attentional tendencies in individuals diagnosed with major depression and (2) social anxiety. These data were processed using residual CNNs through images generated from eye-gaze patterns. Experimental results, obtained with ResNet architectures, demonstrated an average accuracy of 48% for a three-class system and 62% for a two-class system. Based on these exploratory findings, we propose that this method could be employed in rapid, ecological, and effective mental health screening systems to assess well-being through eye-tracking.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, existing models often neglect the relationships between customized objects in generated images. In contrast, this work addresses this gap by focusing on relation-aware customized image generation, which seeks to preserve the identities from image prompts while maintaining the relationship specified in text prompts. Specifically, we introduce DreamRelation, a framework that disentangles identity and relation learning using a carefully curated dataset. Our training data consists of relation-specific images, independent object images containing identity information, and text prompts to guide relation generation. Then, we propose two key modules to tackle the two main challenges: generating accurate and natural relationships, especially when significant pose adjustments are required, and avoiding object confusion in cases of overlap. First, we introduce a keypoint matching loss that effectively guides the model in adjusting object poses closely tied to their relationships. Second, we incorporate local features of the image prompts to better distinguish between objects, preventing confusion in overlapping cases. Extensive results on our proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DreamRelation in generating precise relations while preserving object identities across a diverse set of objects and relationships.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

Since they are parameterized by deep learning models, they are often sensitive to distribution shifts and unreliable when applied to out-of-distribution data, creating a risk of, e.g. underrepresentation bias. This behavior can be flagged using uncertainty quantification methods for generative models, but their availability remains limited. We propose SLUG: A new UQ method for VAEs that combines recent advances in Laplace approximations with stochastic trace estimators to scale gracefully with image dimensionality. We show that our UQ score -- unlike the VAE's encoder variances -- correlates strongly with reconstruction error and racial underrepresentation bias for dermatological images. We also show how pixel-wise uncertainty can detect out-of-distribution image content such as ink, rulers, and patches, which is known to induce learning shortcuts in predictive models.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Leveraging Text-to-Image Generation for Handling Spurious Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17226v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) perform well when both training and test data come from the same domain, but they often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a technique to generate training samples with text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples for in which this correlation does not exist. Our experiments show that across different benchmarks, our technique achieves better worst-group accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[D2C: Unlocking the Potential of Continuous Autoregressive Image Generation with Discrete Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17155v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of image generation, latent-based generative models occupy a dominant status; however, these models rely heavily on image tokenizer. To meet modeling requirements, autoregressive models possessing the characteristics of scalability and flexibility embrace a discrete-valued tokenizer, but face the challenge of poor image generation quality. In contrast, diffusion models take advantage of the continuous-valued tokenizer to achieve better generation quality but are subject to low efficiency and complexity. The existing hybrid models are mainly to compensate for information loss and simplify the diffusion learning process. The potential of merging discrete-valued and continuous-valued tokens in the field of image generation has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose D2C, a novel two-stage method to enhance model generation capacity. In the first stage, the discrete-valued tokens representing coarse-grained image features are sampled by employing a small discrete-valued generator. Then in the second stage, the continuous-valued tokens representing fine-grained image features are learned conditioned on the discrete token sequence. In addition, we design two kinds of fusion modules for seamless interaction. On the ImageNet-256 benchmark, extensive experiment results validate that our model achieves superior performance compared with several continuous-valued and discrete-valued generative models on the class-conditional image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Halton Scheduler For Masked Generative Image Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17076v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Generative Image Transformers (MaskGIT) have emerged as a scalable and efficient image generation framework, able to deliver high-quality visuals with low inference costs. However, MaskGIT's token unmasking scheduler, an essential component of the framework, has not received the attention it deserves. We analyze the sampling objective in MaskGIT, based on the mutual information between tokens, and elucidate its shortcomings. We then propose a new sampling strategy based on our Halton scheduler instead of the original Confidence scheduler. More precisely, our method selects the token's position according to a quasi-random, low-discrepancy Halton sequence. Intuitively, that method spreads the tokens spatially, progressively covering the image uniformly at each step. Our analysis shows that it allows reducing non-recoverable sampling errors, leading to simpler hyper-parameters tuning and better quality images. Our scheduler does not require retraining or noise injection and may serve as a simple drop-in replacement for the original sampling strategy. Evaluation of both class-to-image synthesis on ImageNet and text-to-image generation on the COCO dataset demonstrates that the Halton scheduler outperforms the Confidence scheduler quantitatively by reducing the FID and qualitatively by generating more diverse and more detailed images.

However, these models sometimes fail to accurately capture all the details specified in the input prompts, particularly concerning entities, attributes, and spatial relationships. This issue becomes more pronounced when the prompt contains novel or complex compositions, leading to what are known as compositional generation failure modes. Recently, a new open-source diffusion-based T2I model, FLUX, has been introduced, demonstrating strong performance in high-quality image generation. Additionally, autoregressive T2I models like LlamaGen have claimed competitive visual quality performance compared to diffusion-based models. In this study, we evaluate the compositional generation capabilities of these newly introduced models against established models using the T2I-CompBench benchmark. Our findings reveal that LlamaGen, as a vanilla autoregressive model, is not yet on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models for compositional generation tasks under the same criteria, such as model size and inference time. On the other hand, the open-source diffusion-based model FLUX exhibits compositional generation capabilities comparable to the state-of-the-art closed-source model DALL-E3.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Compositional Learning: Perspectives, Methods, and Paths Forward</p></details> | None |

Utilizing synthetically generated images could offer a valuable alternative. In this work, we explore adapting text-to-image generative models for the surgical domain using the CholecT50 dataset, which provides surgical images annotated with action triplets (instrument, verb, target). We investigate several language models and find T5 to offer more distinct features for differentiating surgical actions on triplet-based textual inputs, and showcasing stronger alignment between long and triplet-based captions. To address challenges in training text-to-image models solely on triplet-based captions without additional inputs and supervisory signals, we discover that triplet text embeddings are instrument-centric in the latent space. Leveraging this insight, we design an instrument-based class balancing technique to counteract data imbalance and skewness, improving training convergence. Extending Imagen, a diffusion-based generative model, we develop Surgical Imagen to generate photorealistic and activity-aligned surgical images from triplet-based textual prompts. We assess the model on quality, alignment, reasoning, and knowledge, achieving FID and CLIP scores of 3.7 and 26.8% respectively. Human expert survey shows that participants were highly challenged by the realistic characteristics of the generated samples, demonstrating Surgical Imagen's effectiveness as a practical alternative to real data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, published in Pattern Recognition Letters 2025, project page at https://camma-public.github.io/endogen/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://camma-public.github.io/endogen) |

However, current diffusion-based methods struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem. Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable solution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt and StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, SADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.Code will be released at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be available at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io) |

This paper explores the critical role of preference data in the training process of diffusion models, particularly in the context of Diffusion-DPO and its subsequent adaptations. We investigate the complexities surrounding universal human preferences in image generation, highlighting the subjective nature of these preferences and the challenges posed by minority samples in preference datasets. Through pilot experiments, we demonstrate the existence of minority samples and their detrimental effects on model performance. We propose Adaptive-DPO -- a novel approach that incorporates a minority-instance-aware metric into the DPO objective. This metric, which includes intra-annotator confidence and inter-annotator stability, distinguishes between majority and minority samples. We introduce an Adaptive-DPO loss function which improves the DPO loss in two ways: enhancing the model's learning of majority labels while mitigating the negative impact of minority samples. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively handles both synthetic minority data and real-world preference data, paving the way for more effective training methodologies in image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the quality and generalizability of 3D content generation remain limited. State-of-the-art methods often require large-scale 3D assets for training, which are challenging to collect. In this work, we introduce Kiss3DGen (Keep It Simple and Straightforward in 3D Generation), an efficient framework for generating, editing, and enhancing 3D objects by repurposing a well-trained 2D image diffusion model for 3D generation. Specifically, we fine-tune a diffusion model to generate ''3D Bundle Image'', a tiled representation composed of multi-view images and their corresponding normal maps. The normal maps are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh, and the multi-view images provide texture mapping, resulting in a complete 3D model. This simple method effectively transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task, maximizing the utilization of knowledge in pretrained diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Kiss3DGen model is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as 3D editing, mesh and texture enhancement, etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce high-quality 3D models efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |

The models are evaluated on a comprehensive range of tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, text generation, image generation, and long-form mixed modal generation. Chameleon demonstrates broad and general capabilities, including state-of-the-art performance in image captioning tasks, outperforms Llama-2 in text-only tasks while being competitive with models such as Mixtral 8x7B and Gemini-Pro, and performs non-trivial image generation, all in a single model. It also matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including Gemini Pro and GPT-4V, according to human judgments on a new long-form mixed-modal generation evaluation, where either the prompt or outputs contain mixed sequences of both images and text.

However, these models may inadvertently generate inappropriate content, such as copyrighted works or offensive images. While existing methods attempt to eliminate specific unwanted concepts, they often fail to ensure complete removal, allowing the concept to reappear in subtle forms. For instance, a model may successfully avoid generating images in Van Gogh's style when explicitly prompted with 'Van Gogh', yet still reproduce his signature artwork when given the prompt 'Starry Night'. In this paper, we propose SAFER, a novel and efficient approach for thoroughly removing target concepts from diffusion models. At a high level, SAFER is inspired by the observed low-dimensional structure of the text embedding space. The method first identifies a concept-specific subspace $S_c$ associated with the target concept c. It then projects the prompt embeddings onto the complementary subspace of $S_c$, effectively erasing the concept from the generated images. Since concepts can be abstract and difficult to fully capture using natural language alone, we employ textual inversion to learn an optimized embedding of the target concept from a reference image. This enables more precise subspace estimation and enhances removal performance. Furthermore, we introduce a subspace expansion strategy to ensure comprehensive and robust concept erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAFER consistently and effectively erases unwanted concepts from diffusion models while preserving generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

To evaluate the robustness of content moderation, several metamorphic testing techniques have been proposed to test content moderation software. However, these techniques mainly focus on general users (e.g., text and image generation). Meanwhile, a recent study shows that developers consider using harmful keywords when naming software artifacts to be an unethical behavior. Exposure to harmful content in software artifacts can negatively impact the mental health of developers, making content moderation for Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) essential. We conduct a preliminary study on program transformations that can be misused to introduce harmful content into auto-generated code, identifying 32 such transformations. To address this, we propose CHT, a coverage-guided harmfulness testing framework that generates prompts using diverse transformations and harmful keywords injected into benign programs. CHT evaluates output damage to assess potential risks in LLM-generated explanations and code. Our evaluation of four Code LLMs and GPT-4o-mini reveals that content moderation in LLM-based code generation is easily bypassed. To enhance moderation, we propose a two-phase approach that first detects harmful content before generating output, improving moderation effectiveness by 483.76\%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the quadratic scaling properties of the attention in DiTs hinder image generation with higher resolution or on devices with limited resources. This work introduces an efficient diffusion transformer (EDiT) to alleviate these efficiency bottlenecks in conventional DiTs and Multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs). First, we present a novel linear compressed attention method that uses a multi-layer convolutional network to modulate queries with local information while keys and values are spatially aggregated. Second, we formulate a hybrid attention scheme for multi-modal inputs that combines linear attention for image-to-image interactions and standard scaled dot-product attention for interactions involving prompts. Merging these two approaches leads to an expressive, linear-time Multimodal Efficient Diffusion Transformer (MM-EDiT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EDiT and MM-EDiT architectures by integrating them into PixArt-Sigma(conventional DiT) and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Medium (MM-DiT), achieving up to 2.2x speedup with comparable image quality after distillation.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike conventional methods that serialize images into fixed-position latent codes with a uniform compression ratio, we introduce an unordered token set representation to dynamically allocate coding capacity based on regional semantic complexity. This TokenSet enhances global context aggregation and improves robustness against local perturbations. To address the critical challenge of modeling discrete sets, we devise a dual transformation mechanism that bijectively converts sets into fixed-length integer sequences with summation constraints. Further, we propose Fixed-Sum Discrete Diffusion--the first framework to simultaneously handle discrete values, fixed sequence length, and summation invariance--enabling effective set distribution modeling. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in semantic-aware representation and generation quality. Our innovations, spanning novel representation and modeling strategies, advance visual generation beyond traditional sequential token paradigms.

The world is generated tile-by-tile, and each new tile is generated within its world-context and then fused with the scene.

In this work, we propose VerbDiff to address the challenge of capturing nuanced interactions within text-to-image diffusion models. VerbDiff is a novel text-to-image generation model that weakens the bias between interaction words and objects, enhancing the understanding of interactions. Specifically, we disentangle various interaction words from frequency-based anchor words and leverage localized interaction regions from generated images to help the model better capture semantics in distinctive words without extra conditions. Our approach enables the model to accurately understand the intended interaction between humans and objects, producing high-quality images with accurate interactions aligned with specified verbs. Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025, code : https://github.com/SeungJuCha/VerbDiff.git</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SeungJuCha/VerbDiff.git) |

However, acquiring sufficient data is often challenging and costly. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in high-quality image synthesis and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel framework called LLM-assisted Paired Image Generation (LaPIG). This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.</p></details> |  | None |

However, training models for high-resolution image generation remains challenging, particularly when training data and computational resources are limited. In this paper, we explore this practical problem from two key perspectives: data and parameter efficiency, and propose a set of key guidelines for ultra-resolution adaptation termed \emph{URAE}. For data efficiency, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that synthetic data generated by some teacher models can significantly promote training convergence. For parameter efficiency, we find that tuning minor components of the weight matrices outperforms widely-used low-rank adapters when synthetic data are unavailable, offering substantial performance gains while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, for models leveraging guidance distillation, such as FLUX, we show that disabling classifier-free guidance, \textit{i.e.}, setting the guidance scale to 1 during adaptation, is crucial for satisfactory performance. Extensive experiments validate that URAE achieves comparable 2K-generation performance to state-of-the-art closed-source models like FLUX1.1 [Pro] Ultra with only 3K samples and 2K iterations, while setting new benchmarks for 4K-resolution generation.

Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available in https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen) |

However, applying these approaches to images requires discretizing continuous pixel data through vector quantization methods like VQ-VAE. To alleviate the quantization errors that existed in VQ-VAE, recent works tend to use larger codebooks. However, this will accordingly expand vocabulary size, complicating the autoregressive modeling task. This paper aims to find a way to enjoy the benefits of large codebooks without making autoregressive modeling more difficult. Through empirical investigation, we discover that tokens with similar codeword representations produce similar effects on the final generated image, revealing significant redundancy in large codebooks. Based on this insight, we propose to predict tokens from coarse to fine (CTF), realized by assigning the same coarse label for similar tokens. Our framework consists of two stages: (1) an autoregressive model that sequentially predicts coarse labels for each token in the sequence, and (2) an auxiliary model that simultaneously predicts fine-grained labels for all tokens conditioned on their coarse labels. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate our method's superior performance, achieving an average improvement of 59 points in Inception Score compared to baselines. Notably, despite adding an inference step, our approach achieves faster sampling speeds.</p></details> | Work in progress | None |

However, the fundamental reliance of self-attention layers on positional embedding versus query-key similarity during generation remains an intriguing question. We present the first mechanistic analysis of RoPE-based MMDiT models (e.g., FLUX), introducing an automated probing strategy that disentangles positional information versus content dependencies by strategically manipulating RoPE during generation. Our analysis reveals distinct dependency patterns that do not straightforwardly correlate with depth, offering new insights into the layer-specific roles in RoPE-based MMDiT. Based on these findings, we propose a training-free, task-specific image editing framework that categorizes editing tasks into three types: position-dependent editing (e.g., object addition), content similarity-dependent editing (e.g., non-rigid editing), and region-preserved editing (e.g., background replacement). For each type, we design tailored key-value injection strategies based on the characteristics of the editing task. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in preserving original semantic content and achieving seamless modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wtybest.github.io/projects/FreeFlux/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wtybest.github.io/projects) |

However, in the remote sensing field, there is still a lack of research on large-scale text-to-image (text2image) generation technology. Existing remote sensing image-text datasets are small in scale and confined to specific geographic areas and scene types. Besides, existing text2image methods have struggled to achieve global-scale, multi-resolution controllable, and unbounded image generation. To address these challenges, this paper presents two key contributions: the Git-10M dataset and the Text2Earth foundation model. Git-10M is a global-scale image-text dataset comprising 10.5 million image-text pairs, 5 times larger than the previous largest one. The dataset covers a wide range of geographic scenes and contains resolution information, significantly surpassing existing datasets in both size and diversity. Building on Git-10M, we propose Text2Earth, a 1.3 billion parameter generative foundation model based on the diffusion framework to model global-scale remote sensing scenes. Text2Earth integrates a resolution guidance mechanism, enabling users to specify image resolutions. A dynamic condition adaptation strategy is proposed for training and inference to improve image quality. Text2Earth excels in zero-shot text2image generation and demonstrates robust generalization and flexibility across multiple tasks, including unbounded scene construction, image editing, and cross-modal image generation. This robust capability surpasses previous models restricted to the basic fixed size and limited scene types. On the previous benchmark dataset, Text2Earth outperforms previous models with an improvement of +26.23 FID and +20.95% Zero-shot Cls-OA metric.Our project page is https://chen-yang-liu.github.io/Text2Earth</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://chen-yang-liu.github.io/Text2Earth) |

Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for video streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video streaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in real-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient acceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus. Specifically, we propose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational cost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant computations by 16.6\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original Promptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed. Compared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS improvement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\% of severely distorted frames (compared to VQGAN).</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures | None |

We start by adapting an existing next-scale prediction autoregressive (AR) architecture to T2I generation, investigating and mitigating training stability issues in the process. Next, we argue that scale-wise transformers do not require causality and propose a non-causal counterpart facilitating ~21% faster sampling and lower memory usage while also achieving slightly better generation quality. Furthermore, we reveal that classifier-free guidance at high-resolution scales is often unnecessary and can even degrade performance. By disabling guidance at these scales, we achieve an additional sampling acceleration of ~32% and improve the generation of fine-grained details. Extensive human preference studies and automated evaluations show that Switti outperforms existing T2I AR models and competes with state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models while being up to 7x faster.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

Humans, on the other hand, can often rely on their knowledge and experience to fill in the gaps. For example, the simple task of organizing newly bought produce into the fridge involves deciding where to put each thing individually, how to arrange them together meaningfully, e.g. putting related things together, all while there is no clear right and wrong way to accomplish this task. We could encode all this information on how to do such things explicitly into the robots' knowledge base, but this can quickly become overwhelming, considering the number of potential tasks and circumstances the robot could encounter. However, images of the real world often implicitly encode answers to such questions and can show which configurations of objects are meaningful or are usually used by humans. An image of a full fridge can give a lot of information about how things are usually arranged in relation to each other and the full fridge at large. Modern generative systems are capable of generating plausible images of the real world and can be conditioned on the environment in which the robot operates. Here we investigate the idea of using the implicit knowledge about the world of modern generative AI systems given by their ability to generate convincing images of the real world to solve under-specified tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures | None |

A common approach to personalization is concept learning, which can integrate the subject into existing models relatively quickly, but produces images whose quality tends to deteriorate quickly when the number of subject images is small. Quality can be improved by pre-training an encoder, but training restricts generation to the training distribution, and is time consuming. It is still an open hard challenge to personalize image generation and editing from a single image without training. Here, we present SISO, a novel, training-free approach based on optimizing a similarity score with an input subject image. More specifically, SISO iteratively generates images and optimizes the model based on loss of similarity with the given subject image until a satisfactory level of similarity is achieved, allowing plug-and-play optimization to any image generator. We evaluated SISO in two tasks, image editing and image generation, using a diverse data set of personal subjects, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in image quality, subject fidelity, and background preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is at https://siso-paper.github.io/</p></details> | None |

As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals. It summarizes datasets, relevant brain regions, and categorizes existing methods by model structure. Additionally, it evaluates model performance and discusses their effectiveness. Finally, it identifies key challenges and proposes future research directions, offering valuable insights for the field.

Further, since the DNN behavior cannot be assessed through code inspection and analysis, test automation has become an essential activity to gain confidence in the reliability of DNNs. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art automated testing solutions largely rely on simulators, whose fidelity is always imperfect, thus affecting the validity of test results. To address such limitations, we propose to combine meta-heuristic search, used to explore the input space using simulators, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to transform the data generated by simulators into realistic input images. Such images can be used both to assess the DNN performance and to retrain the DNN more effectively. We applied our approach to a state-of-the-art DNN performing semantic segmentation and demonstrated that it outperforms a state-of-the-art GAN-based testing solution and several baselines. Specifically, it leads to the largest number of diverse images leading to the worst DNN performance. Further, the images generated with our approach, lead to the highest improvement in DNN performance when used for retraining. In conclusion, we suggest to always integrate GAN components when performing search-driven, simulator-based testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

While cross-attention has been well-studied in text-to-image tasks, their interpretability in image-to-image (I2I) diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces Image-to-Image Attribution Maps (I2AM), a method that enhances the interpretability of I2I models by visualizing bidirectional attribution maps, from the reference image to the generated image and vice versa. I2AM aggregates cross-attention scores across time steps, attention heads, and layers, offering insights into how critical features are transferred between images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of I2AM across object detection, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our results demonstrate that I2AM successfully identifies key regions responsible for generating the output, even in complex scenes. Additionally, we introduce the Inpainting Mask Attention Consistency Score (IMACS) as a novel evaluation metric to assess the alignment between attribution maps and inpainting masks, which correlates strongly with existing performance metrics. Through extensive experiments, we show that I2AM enables model debugging and refinement, providing practical tools for improving I2I model's performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |

To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?" The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

While VLFMs show a rich understanding of semantic content across modalities, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment tasks that require precise correspondence between image regions and textual descriptions a limitation in medical imaging, where accurate localization and detection of clinical features are essential for diagnosis and analysis. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage architecture where a pre-trained VLFM provides a cursory semantic understanding, while a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm refines the alignment through an iterative process that optimizes for understanding semantic context. The reward signal is designed to align the semantic information of the text with synthesized images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a medical imaging skin dataset where the generated images exhibit improved generation quality and alignment with prompt over the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion.

A fundamental element of the transformer architecture is self-attention, which allows the model to capture intricate dependencies within the data. However, the self-attention mechanism also incurs significant computational and memory costs, particularly for long sequences. In this paper, we introduce ATTENTION2D, a novel approach that exploits parallelism along two dimensions - query and key/value - of the self-attention operation. This method enables efficient distribution and parallelization of computations across multiple devices. Our approach facilitates asymptotically faster training and inference phases compared to previous methods, without relying on approximations or incurring additional computational or memory overheads. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques that struggle to scale with an increasing number of processing units, our approach effectively scales with additional processing units. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving communication efficiency and scalability. Compared to Ring Attention, our approach demonstrated up to a 5x performance boost on a GPT-3-like model using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs across 16 nodes, and up to a 9.4x performance boost on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 64 nodes.</p></details> |  | None |

Predominant training datasets (e.g., InsPix2Pix) are created using text-to-image generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) which are not trained for image editing. Accordingly, these datasets suffer from inaccurate instruction following, poor detail preserving, and generation artifacts. In this paper, we propose to address the training data quality issue with multi-perspective reward data instead of refining the ground-truth image quality. 1) we first design a quantitative metric system based on best-in-class LVLM (Large Vision Language Model), i.e., GPT-4o in our case, to evaluate the generation quality from 3 perspectives, namely, instruction following, detail preserving, and generation quality. For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\sim 5$ and text descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited images, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e., RewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly integrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to learn from the imperfect training triplets. During training, the reward scores and text descriptions are encoded as embeddings and fed into both the latent space and the U-Net of the editing models as auxiliary conditions. 3) We also build a challenging evaluation benchmark with real-world images/photos and diverse editing instructions, named Real-Edit. Experiments indicate that our multi-reward conditioned model outperforms its no-reward counterpart on two popular editing pipelines, i.e., InsPix2Pix and SmartEdit.

However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p></details> |  | None |

While the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art results, high computational demands due to multi-step inference limited its use in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that the perceived inefficiency was caused by a flaw in the inference pipeline that has so far gone unnoticed. The fixed model performs comparably to the best previously reported configuration while being more than 200$\times$ faster. To optimize for downstream task performance, we perform end-to-end fine-tuning on top of the single-step model with task-specific losses and get a deterministic model that outperforms all other diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models on common zero-shot benchmarks. We surprisingly find that this fine-tuning protocol also works directly on Stable Diffusion and achieves comparable performance to current state-of-the-art diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models, calling into question some of the conclusions drawn from prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 Oral.

This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, our analysis reveals that autoencoder accuracy on segmentation mask using quantized embeddings (e.g. VQ-VAE) is 8% lower than continuous-valued embeddings (e.g. KL-VAE). Motivated by this, we propose a continuous-valued embedding framework for semantic segmentation. By reformulating semantic mask generation as a continuous image-to-embedding diffusion process, our approach eliminates the need for discrete latent representations while preserving fine-grained spatial and semantic details. Our key contribution includes a diffusion-guided autoregressive transformer that learns a continuous semantic embedding space by modeling long-range dependencies in image features. Our framework contains a unified architecture combining a VAE encoder for continuous feature extraction, a diffusion-guided transformer for conditioned embedding generation, and a VAE decoder for semantic mask reconstruction. Our setting facilitates zero-shot domain adaptation capabilities enabled by the continuity of the embedding space. Experiments across diverse datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and domain-shifted variants) demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness to distribution shifts, including adverse weather (e.g., fog, snow) and viewpoint variations. Our model also exhibits strong noise resilience, achieving robust performance ($\approx$ 95% AP compared to baseline) under gaussian noise, moderate motion blur, and moderate brightness/contrast variations, while experiencing only a moderate impact ($\approx$ 90% AP compared to baseline) from 50% salt and pepper noise, saturation and hue shifts.

The YOLOv12n configuration achieved the highest precision at 0.916, the highest recall at 0.969, and the highest mean Average Precision (mAP@50) at 0.978. In comparison, the YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which achieved the highest precision at 0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and YOLOv10l both achieved the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving the highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on realistic LLM-generated datasets surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics. The technique also offered a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the agricultural field. In addition, this study compared the computational efficiency of all versions of YOLOv12, v11 and v10, where YOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's 5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new and more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO model among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 series of models.

| **[Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O: Distilling Masked Diffusion Models into One-step Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15457v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a powerful generative modeling technique. Despite their remarkable results, they typically suffer from slow inference with several steps. In this paper, we propose Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O, a novel approach that distills masked diffusion models into a one-step generator. Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O addresses two key challenges: (1) the intractability of using intermediate-step information for one-step generation, which we solve through token-level distribution matching that optimizes model output logits by an 'on-policy framework' with the help of an auxiliary model; and (2) the lack of entropy in the initial distribution, which we address through a token initialization strategy that injects randomness while maintaining similarity to teacher training distribution. We show Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O's effectiveness on both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation, impressively achieving performance competitive to multi-step teacher outputs while drastically reducing inference time. To our knowledge, we are the first to successfully achieve one-step distillation of masked diffusion models and the first to apply discrete distillation to text-to-image generation, opening new paths for efficient generative modeling.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TruthLens:A Training-Free Paradigm for DeepFake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15342v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of synthetic images generated by advanced AI models poses significant challenges in identifying and understanding manipulated visual content. Current fake image detection methods predominantly rely on binary classification models that focus on accuracy while often neglecting interpretability, leaving users without clear insights into why an image is deemed real or fake. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruthLens, a novel training-free framework that reimagines deepfake detection as a visual question-answering (VQA) task. TruthLens utilizes state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) to observe and describe visual artifacts and combines this with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to analyze and aggregate evidence into informed decisions. By adopting a multimodal approach, TruthLens seamlessly integrates visual and semantic reasoning to not only classify images as real or fake but also provide interpretable explanations for its decisions. This transparency enhances trust and provides valuable insights into the artifacts that signal synthetic content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms conventional methods, achieving high accuracy on challenging datasets while maintaining a strong emphasis on explainability. By reframing deepfake detection as a reasoning-driven process, TruthLens establishes a new paradigm in combating synthetic media, combining cutting-edge performance with interpretability to address the growing threats of visual disinformation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Guardians of Generation: Dynamic Inference-Time Copyright Shielding with Adaptive Guidance for AI Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16171v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern text-to-image generative models can inadvertently reproduce copyrighted content memorized in their training data, raising serious concerns about potential copyright infringement. We introduce Guardians of Generation, a model agnostic inference time framework for dynamic copyright shielding in AI image generation. Our approach requires no retraining or modification of the generative model weights, instead integrating seamlessly with existing diffusion pipelines. It augments the generation process with an adaptive guidance mechanism comprising three components: a detection module, a prompt rewriting module, and a guidance adjustment module. The detection module monitors user prompts and intermediate generation steps to identify features indicative of copyrighted content before they manifest in the final output. If such content is detected, the prompt rewriting mechanism dynamically transforms the user's prompt by sanitizing or replacing references that could trigger copyrighted material while preserving the prompt's intended semantics. The adaptive guidance module adaptively steers the diffusion process away from flagged content by modulating the model's sampling trajectory. Together, these components form a robust shield that enables a tunable balance between preserving creative fidelity and ensuring copyright compliance. We validate our method on a variety of generative models such as Stable Diffusion, SDXL, and Flux, demonstrating substantial reductions in copyrighted content generation with negligible impact on output fidelity or alignment with user intent. This work provides a practical, plug-and-play safeguard for generative image models, enabling more responsible deployment under real-world copyright constraints.

Existing methods often partially utilize image inputs, focusing on specific elements like objects or styles, or they experience a decline in generation quality with complex, multi-image instructions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Training-Free Text-and-Image-to-Image (TF-TI2I), which adapts cutting-edge T2I models such as SD3 without the need for additional training. Our method capitalizes on the MM-DiT architecture, in which we point out that textual tokens can implicitly learn visual information from vision tokens. We enhance this interaction by extracting a condensed visual representation from reference images, facilitating selective information sharing through Reference Contextual Masking -- this technique confines the usage of contextual tokens to instruction-relevant visual information. Additionally, our Winner-Takes-All module mitigates distribution shifts by prioritizing the most pertinent references for each vision token. Addressing the gap in TI2I evaluation, we also introduce the FG-TI2I Bench, a comprehensive benchmark tailored for TI2I and compatible with existing T2I methods. Our approach shows robust performance across various benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness in handling complex image-generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

The critical challenge underpinning this task is ensuring both the fidelity of the generated images and their semantic alignment with the provided conditions. To tackle this issue, previous studies have employed supervised perceptual losses derived from pre-trained models, i.e., reward models, to enforce alignment between the condition and the generated result. However, we observe one inherent shortcoming: considering the diversity of synthesized images, the reward model usually provides inaccurate feedback when encountering newly generated data, which can undermine the training process. To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware reward modeling, called Ctrl-U, including uncertainty estimation and uncertainty-aware regularization, designed to reduce the adverse effects of imprecise feedback from the reward model. Given the inherent cognitive uncertainty within reward models, even images generated under identical conditions often result in a relatively large discrepancy in reward loss. Inspired by the observation, we explicitly leverage such prediction variance as an uncertainty indicator. Based on the uncertainty estimation, we regularize the model training by adaptively rectifying the reward. In particular, rewards with lower uncertainty receive higher loss weights, while those with higher uncertainty are given reduced weights to allow for larger variability. The proposed uncertainty regularization facilitates reward fine-tuning through consistency construction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methodology in improving the controllability and generation quality, as well as its scalability across diverse conditional scenarios.

| **[LEGION: Learning to Ground and Explain for Synthetic Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15264v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in generative technology have emerged as a double-edged sword. While offering powerful tools that enhance convenience, they also pose significant social concerns. As defenders, current synthetic image detection methods often lack artifact-level textual interpretability and are overly focused on image manipulation detection, and current datasets usually suffer from outdated generators and a lack of fine-grained annotations. In this paper, we introduce SynthScars, a high-quality and diverse dataset consisting of 12,236 fully synthetic images with human-expert annotations. It features 4 distinct image content types, 3 categories of artifacts, and fine-grained annotations covering pixel-level segmentation, detailed textual explanations, and artifact category labels. Furthermore, we propose LEGION (LEarning to Ground and explain for Synthetic Image detectiON), a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based image forgery analysis framework that integrates artifact detection, segmentation, and explanation. Building upon this capability, we further explore LEGION as a controller, integrating it into image refinement pipelines to guide the generation of higher-quality and more realistic images. Extensive experiments show that LEGION outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, particularly surpassing the second-best traditional expert on SynthScars by 3.31% in mIoU and 7.75% in F1 score. Moreover, the refined images generated under its guidance exhibit stronger alignment with human preferences. The code, model, and dataset will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://opendatalab.github.io/LEGION</p></details> | [Code Link](https://opendatalab.github.io/LEGION) |
| **[Detect-and-Guide: Self-regulation of Diffusion Models for Safe Text-to-Image Generation via Guideline Token Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15197v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in synthesis tasks; however, there is a growing concern about their potential misuse in creating harmful content. To mitigate these risks, post-hoc model intervention techniques, such as concept unlearning and safety guidance, have been developed. However, fine-tuning model weights or adapting the hidden states of the diffusion model operates in an uninterpretable way, making it unclear which part of the intermediate variables is responsible for unsafe generation. These interventions severely affect the sampling trajectory when erasing harmful concepts from complex, multi-concept prompts, thus hindering their practical use in real-world settings. In this work, we propose the safe generation framework Detect-and-Guide (DAG), leveraging the internal knowledge of diffusion models to perform self-diagnosis and fine-grained self-regulation during the sampling process. DAG first detects harmful concepts from noisy latents using refined cross-attention maps of optimized tokens, then applies safety guidance with adaptive strength and editing regions to negate unsafe generation. The optimization only requires a small annotated dataset and can provide precise detection maps with generalizability and concept specificity. Moreover, DAG does not require fine-tuning of diffusion models, and therefore introduces no loss to their generation diversity. Experiments on erasing sexual content show that DAG achieves state-of-the-art safe generation performance, balancing harmfulness mitigation and text-following performance on multi-concept real-world prompts.</p></details> | CVPR25 | None |
| **[Low-Biased General Annotated Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10831v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training backbone networks on a general annotated dataset (e.g., ImageNet) that comprises numerous manually collected images with category annotations has proven to be indispensable for enhancing the generalization capacity of downstream visual tasks. However, those manually collected images often exhibit bias, which is non-transferable across either categories or domains, thus causing the model's generalization capacity degeneration. To mitigate this problem, we present a low-biased general annotated dataset generation framework (lbGen). Instead of expensive manual collection, we aim at directly generating low-biased images with category annotations. To achieve this goal, we propose to leverage the advantage of a multimodal foundation model (e.g., CLIP), in terms of aligning images in a low-biased semantic space defined by language. Specifically, we develop a bi-level semantic alignment loss, which not only forces all generated images to be consistent with the semantic distribution of all categories belonging to the target dataset in an adversarial learning manner, but also requires each generated image to match the semantic description of its category name. In addition, we further cast an existing image quality scoring model into a quality assurance loss to preserve the quality of the generated image. By leveraging these two loss functions, we can obtain a low-biased image generation model by simply fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model using only all category names in the target dataset as input. Experimental results confirm that, compared with the manually labeled dataset or other synthetic datasets, the utilization of our generated low-biased dataset leads to stable generalization capacity enhancement of different backbone networks across various tasks, especially in tasks where the manually labeled samples are scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> | None |
| **[Advancing Deep Learning through Probability Engineering: A Pragmatic Paradigm for Modern AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18958v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid progression of deep learning, pushing us closer to the realization of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Probabilistic modeling is critical to many of these advancements, which provides a foundational framework for capturing data distributions. However, as the scale and complexity of AI applications grow, traditional probabilistic modeling faces escalating challenges, such as high-dimensional parameter spaces, heterogeneous data sources, and evolving real-world requirements often render classical approaches insufficiently flexible. This paper proposes a novel concept, Probability Engineering, which treats the already-learned probability distributions within deep learning as engineering artifacts. Rather than merely fitting or inferring distributions, we actively modify and reinforce them to better address the diverse and evolving demands of modern AI. Specifically, Probability Engineering introduces novel techniques and constraints to refine existing probability distributions, improving their robustness, efficiency, adaptability, or trustworthiness. We showcase this paradigm through a series of applications spanning Bayesian deep learning, Edge AI (including federated learning and knowledge distillation), and Generative AI (such as text-to-image generation with diffusion models and high-quality text generation with large language models). These case studies demonstrate how probability distributions once treated as static objects can be engineered to meet the diverse and evolving requirements of large-scale, data-intensive, and trustworthy AI systems. By systematically expanding and strengthening the role of probabilistic modeling, Probability Engineering paves the way for more robust, adaptive, efficient, and trustworthy deep learning solutions in today's fast-growing AI era.</p></details> | Ph.D. dissertation | None |
| **[Toward Generalized Image Quality Assessment: Relaxing the Perfect Reference Quality Assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11221v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) generally assumes that reference images are of perfect quality. However, this assumption is flawed due to the sensor and optical limitations of modern imaging systems. Moreover, recent generative enhancement methods are capable of producing images of higher quality than their original. All of these challenge the effectiveness and applicability of current FR-IQA models. To relax the assumption of perfect reference image quality, we build a large-scale IQA database, namely DiffIQA, containing approximately 180,000 images generated by a diffusion-based image enhancer with adjustable hyper-parameters. Each image is annotated by human subjects as either worse, similar, or better quality compared to its reference. Building on this, we present a generalized FR-IQA model, namely Adaptive Fidelity-Naturalness Evaluator (A-FINE), to accurately assess and adaptively combine the fidelity and naturalness of a test image. A-FINE aligns well with standard FR-IQA when the reference image is much more natural than the test image. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that A-FINE surpasses standard FR-IQA models on well-established IQA datasets and our newly created DiffIQA. To further validate A-FINE, we additionally construct a super-resolution IQA benchmark (SRIQA-Bench), encompassing test images derived from ten state-of-the-art SR methods with reliable human quality annotations. Tests on SRIQA-Bench re-affirm the advantages of A-FINE.

| **[Next Patch Prediction for Autoregressive Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15321v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models, built based on the Next Token Prediction (NTP) paradigm, show great potential in developing a unified framework that integrates both language and vision tasks. Pioneering works introduce NTP to autoregressive visual generation tasks. In this work, we rethink the NTP for autoregressive image generation and extend it to a novel Next Patch Prediction (NPP) paradigm. Our key idea is to group and aggregate image tokens into patch tokens with higher information density. By using patch tokens as a more compact input sequence, the autoregressive model is trained to predict the next patch, significantly reducing computational costs. To further exploit the natural hierarchical structure of image data, we propose a multi-scale coarse-to-fine patch grouping strategy. With this strategy, the training process begins with a large patch size and ends with vanilla NTP where the patch size is 1$\times$1, thus maintaining the original inference process without modifications. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of model sizes demonstrate that NPP could reduce the training cost to around 0.6 times while improving image generation quality by up to 1.0 FID score on the ImageNet 256x256 generation benchmark. Notably, our method retains the original autoregressive model architecture without introducing additional trainable parameters or specifically designing a custom image tokenizer, offering a flexible and plug-and-play solution for enhancing autoregressive visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Next-Patch-Prediction, v2: add related work "Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models", v3: Add content</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Next-Patch-Prediction) |
| **[Leveraging BEV Paradigm for Ground-to-Aerial Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01812v4)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground-to-aerial image synthesis focuses on generating realistic aerial images from corresponding ground street view images while maintaining consistent content layout, simulating a top-down view. The significant viewpoint difference leads to domain gaps between views, and dense urban scenes limit the visible range of street views, making this cross-view generation task particularly challenging. In this paper, we introduce SkyDiffusion, a novel cross-view generation method for synthesizing aerial images from street view images, utilizing a diffusion model and the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) paradigm. The Curved-BEV method in SkyDiffusion converts street-view images into a BEV perspective, effectively bridging the domain gap, and employs a "multi-to-one" mapping strategy to address occlusion issues in dense urban scenes. Next, SkyDiffusion designed a BEV-guided diffusion model to generate content-consistent and realistic aerial images. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, Ground2Aerial-3, designed for diverse ground-to-aerial image synthesis applications, including disaster scene aerial synthesis, low-altitude UAV image synthesis, and historical high-resolution satellite image synthesis tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SkyDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-view datasets across natural (CVUSA), suburban (CVACT), urban (VIGOR-Chicago), and various application scenarios (G2A-3), achieving realistic and content-consistent aerial image generation.

However, obtaining a comprehensive, multi-plane annotated fetal US dataset remains challenging, particularly for rare or complex anomalies owing to their low incidence and numerous subtypes. This poses difficulties in training novice radiologists and developing robust AI models, especially for detecting abnormal fetuses. In this study, we introduce a Flexible Fetal US image generation framework (FetalFlex) to address these challenges, which leverages anatomical structures and multimodal information to enable controllable synthesis of fetal US images across diverse planes. Specifically, FetalFlex incorporates a pre-alignment module to enhance controllability and introduces a repaint strategy to ensure consistent texture and appearance. Moreover, a two-stage adaptive sampling strategy is developed to progressively refine image quality from coarse to fine levels. We believe that FetalFlex is the first method capable of generating both in-distribution normal and out-of-distribution abnormal fetal US images, without requiring any abnormal data. Experiments on multi-center datasets demonstrate that FetalFlex achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple image quality metrics. A reader study further confirms the close alignment of the generated results with expert visual assessments. Furthermore, synthetic images by FetalFlex significantly improve the performance of six typical deep models in downstream classification and anomaly detection tasks. Lastly, FetalFlex's anatomy-level controllable generation offers a unique advantage for anomaly simulation and creating paired or counterfactual data at the pixel level.

| **[Efficient Personalization of Quantized Diffusion Model without Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14868v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis, but they demand extensive computational and memory resources for training, fine-tuning and inference. Although advanced quantization techniques have successfully minimized memory usage for inference, training and fine-tuning these quantized models still require large memory possibly due to dequantization for accurate computation of gradients and/or backpropagation for gradient-based algorithms. However, memory-efficient fine-tuning is particularly desirable for applications such as personalization that often must be run on edge devices like mobile phones with private data. In this work, we address this challenge by quantizing a diffusion model with personalization via Textual Inversion and by leveraging a zeroth-order optimization on personalization tokens without dequantization so that it does not require gradient and activation storage for backpropagation that consumes considerable memory. Since a gradient estimation using zeroth-order optimization is quite noisy for a single or a few images in personalization, we propose to denoise the estimated gradient by projecting it onto a subspace that is constructed with the past history of the tokens, dubbed Subspace Gradient. In addition, we investigated the influence of text embedding in image generation, leading to our proposed time steps sampling, dubbed Partial Uniform Timestep Sampling for sampling with effective diffusion timesteps. Our method achieves comparable performance to prior methods in image and text alignment scores for personalizing Stable Diffusion with only forward passes while reducing training memory demand up to $8.2\times$.</p></details> |  | None |

We formalize this problem as shape-based image generation, a new text-guided image-to-image translation task that requires rearranging the input set of rigid shapes into non-overlapping configurations and visually communicating the target concept. Unlike pixel-manipulation approaches, our method, ShapeShift, explicitly parameterizes each shape within a differentiable vector graphics pipeline, iteratively optimizing placement and orientation through score distillation sampling from pretrained diffusion models. To preserve arrangement clarity, we introduce a content-aware collision resolution mechanism that applies minimal semantically coherent adjustments when overlaps occur, ensuring smooth convergence toward physically valid configurations. By bridging diffusion-based semantic guidance with explicit geometric constraints, our approach yields interpretable compositions where spatial relationships clearly embody the textual prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate compelling results across diverse scenarios, with quantitative and qualitative advantages over alternative techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we observe that training velocity solely from the final layer output underutilizes the rich inter layer representations, potentially impeding model convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepFlow, a novel framework that enhances velocity representation through inter layer communication. DeepFlow partitions transformer layers into balanced branches with deep supervision and inserts a lightweight Velocity Refiner with Acceleration (VeRA) block between adjacent branches, which aligns the intermediate velocity features within transformer blocks. Powered by the improved deep supervision via the internal velocity alignment, DeepFlow converges 8 times faster on ImageNet with equivalent performance and further reduces FID by 2.6 while halving training time compared to previous flow based models without a classifier free guidance. DeepFlow also outperforms baselines in text to image generation tasks, as evidenced by evaluations on MSCOCO and zero shot GenEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://deepflow-project.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, evaluating the performance of image generation models remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we propose ICE-Bench, a unified and comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously assess image generation models. Its comprehensiveness could be summarized in the following key features: (1) Coarse-to-Fine Tasks: We systematically deconstruct image generation into four task categories: No-ref/Ref Image Creating/Editing, based on the presence or absence of source images and reference images. And further decompose them into 31 fine-grained tasks covering a broad spectrum of image generation requirements, culminating in a comprehensive benchmark. (2) Multi-dimensional Metrics: The evaluation framework assesses image generation capabilities across 6 dimensions: aesthetic quality, imaging quality, prompt following, source consistency, reference consistency, and controllability. 11 metrics are introduced to support the multi-dimensional evaluation. Notably, we introduce VLLM-QA, an innovative metric designed to assess the success of image editing by leveraging large models. (3) Hybrid Data: The data comes from real scenes and virtual generation, which effectively improves data diversity and alleviates the bias problem in model evaluation. Through ICE-Bench, we conduct a thorough analysis of existing generation models, revealing both the challenging nature of our benchmark and the gap between current model capabilities and real-world generation requirements. To foster further advancements in the field, we will open-source ICE-Bench, including its dataset, evaluation code, and models, thereby providing a valuable resource for the research community.</p></details> | 17 pages | None |

Although query performance prediction is an active research topic in information retrieval, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior study that analyzes the difficulty of queries (referred to as prompts) in text-to-image generation, based on human judgments.

Additionally, we extend these evaluations to text-to-image retrieval by collecting manual annotations that represent retrieval performance. We thus establish the first joint benchmark for prompt and query performance prediction (PQPP) across both tasks, comprising over 10K queries. Our benchmark enables (i) the comparative assessment of prompt/query difficulty in both image generation and image retrieval, and (ii) the evaluation of prompt/query performance predictors addressing both generation and retrieval.

We present a novel pipeline that first produces a G-buffer (albedo, normals, depth, roughness, and metallic) from a text prompt and then renders a final image through a modular neural network. This intermediate representation enables fine-grained editing: users can copy and paste within specific G-buffer channels to insert or reposition objects, or apply masks to the irradiance channel to adjust lighting locally. As a result, real objects can be seamlessly integrated into virtual scenes, and virtual objects can be placed into real environments with high fidelity. By separating scene decomposition from image rendering, our method offers a practical balance between detailed post-generation control and efficient text-driven synthesis. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a variety of examples, showing that G-buffer editing significantly extends the flexibility of text-guided image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, multiple benchmarks show that synthetic images can still suffer from poor alignment with the prompt, i.e., images show wrong attribute binding, subject positioning, numeracy, etc. While the literature offers many methods to improve T2I alignment, they all consider only Diffusion Models, and require auxiliary datasets, scoring models, and linguistic analysis of the prompt. In this paper we aim to address these gaps. First, we introduce RFMI, a novel Mutual Information (MI) estimator for RF models that uses the pre-trained model itself for the MI estimation. Then, we investigate a self-supervised fine-tuning approach for T2I alignment based on RFMI that does not require auxiliary information other than the pre-trained model itself. Specifically, a fine-tuning set is constructed by selecting synthetic images generated from the pre-trained RF model and having high point-wise MI between images and prompts. Our experiments on MI estimation benchmarks demonstrate the validity of RFMI, and empirical fine-tuning on SD3.5-Medium confirms the effectiveness of RFMI for improving T2I alignment while maintaining image quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Deep Generative Model in Machine Learning: Theory, Principle and Efficacy</p></details> | None |

Relying on a pre-trained LDR generative diffusion models is vital as, first, there is no sufficiently large HDR image dataset available to re-train them, and, second, even if it was, re-training such models is impossible for most compute budgets. Instead, we seek inspiration from the HDR image capture literature that traditionally fuses sets of LDR images, called "exposure brackets'', to produce a single HDR image. We operate multiple denoising processes to generate multiple LDR brackets that together form a valid HDR result. The key to making this work is to introduce a consistency term into the diffusion process to couple the brackets such that they agree across the exposure range they share while accounting for possible differences due to the quantization error. We demonstrate state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional or restoration-type (LDR2HDR) generative modeling results, yet in HDR.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 14 figures, Accepted to Eurographics 2025, see https://bracketdiffusion.mpi-inf.mpg.de</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

Creating SEA-VL, a Multicultural Vision-Language Dataset for Southeast Asia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07920v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region of extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity, yet it remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language (VL) research. This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that fail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally relevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond crowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the automatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image generation. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision models, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA cultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and cultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA culturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing datasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA, fostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically represent diverse cultures across SEA.</p></details> | <details><summary>[SEA-...</summary><p>[SEA-VL Dataset] https://huggingface.co/collections/SEACrowd/sea-vl-multicultural-vl-dataset-for-southeast-asia-67cf223d0c341d4ba2b236e7 [Appendix J] https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd.github.io/blob/master/docs/SEA_VL_Appendix_J.pdf</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd.github.io) |

Researchers are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed. By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes, simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images significantly improve downstream perception models performance. Finally, we explored the generative performance of the world model in urban autonomous driving scenarios.

Preference-based RL mitigates some of these pitfalls by learning rewards from comparative feedback rather than hand-crafted signals, yet scaling human annotations remains challenging. Recent work uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate preference labeling, but a single final-state image generally fails to capture the agent's full motion. In this paper, we present a two-part solution that both improves feedback accuracy and better aligns reward learning with the agent's policy. First, we overlay trajectory sketches on final observations to reveal the path taken, allowing VLMs to provide more reliable preferences-improving preference accuracy by approximately 15-20% in metaworld tasks. Second, we regularize reward learning by incorporating the agent's performance, ensuring that the reward model is optimized based on data generated by the current policy; this addition boosts episode returns by 20-30% in locomotion tasks. Empirical studies on metaworld demonstrate that our method achieves, for instance, around 70-80% success rate in all tasks, compared to below 50% for standard approaches. These results underscore the efficacy of combining richer visual representations with agent-aware reward regularization.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

To understand what variations in a face lead to different subjective impressions, this work uses generative models to find semantically meaningful edits to a face image that change perceived attributes. Unlike prior work that relied on statistical manipulation in feature space, our end-to-end framework considers trade-offs between preserving identity and changing perceptual attributes. It maps latent space directions to changes in attribute scores, enabling a perceptually significant identity-preserving transformation of any input face along an attribute axis according to a target change. We train on real and synthetic faces, evaluate for in-domain and out-of-domain images using predictive models and human ratings, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach. Ultimately, such a framework can be used to understand and explain trends and biases in subjective interpretation of faces that are not dependent on the subject's identity. This is demonstrated with improved model performance for first impression prediction when augmenting the training data with images generated by the proposed approach for a wider range of input to learn associations between face features and subjective attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Additional details and experiments</p></details> | None |

Our unified autoregressive architecture processes multimodal image and text inputs, generating discrete tokens for text and continuous tokens for image. We find though there is an inherent trade-off between the image generation and understanding task, a carefully tuned training recipe enables them to improve each other. By selecting an appropriate loss balance weight, the unified model achieves results comparable to or exceeding those of single-task baselines on both tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that employing stronger pre-trained LLMs and random-order generation during training is important to achieve high-fidelity image generation within this unified framework. Built upon the Gemma model series, UniFluid exhibits competitive performance across both image generation and understanding, demonstrating strong transferability to various downstream tasks, including image editing for generation, as well as visual captioning and question answering for understanding.</p></details> | Tech report | None |

In this work, we introduce BlobCtrl, a framework that unifies element-level generation and editing using a probabilistic blob-based representation. By employing blobs as visual primitives, our approach effectively decouples and represents spatial location, semantic content, and identity information, enabling precise element-level manipulation. Our key contributions include: 1) a dual-branch diffusion architecture with hierarchical feature fusion for seamless foreground-background integration; 2) a self-supervised training paradigm with tailored data augmentation and score functions; and 3) controllable dropout strategies to balance fidelity and diversity. To support further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that BlobCtrl excels in various element-level manipulation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for precise and flexible visual content creation.

Though the performance of tokenizer plays an essential role to the successful generation, its current evaluation metrics (e.g. rFID) fail to precisely assess the tokenizer and correlate its performance to the generation quality (e.g. gFID). In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for the discrepancy of reconstruction and generation qualities in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme to facilitate latent space construction. Specifically, a latent perturbation approach is proposed to simulate sampling noises, i.e., the unexpected tokens sampled, from the generative process. With the latent perturbation, we further propose (1) a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, i.e., pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality and (2) a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed. Extensive benchmarking are conducted with 11 advanced discrete image tokenizers with 2 autoregressive generation models to validate our approach. The tokenizer trained with our proposed latent perturbation achieve a notable 1.60 gFID with classifier-free guidance (CFG) and 3.45 gFID without CFG with a $\sim$400M generator.

A widely adopted approach to explore their functional alignment is to identify metamers for both humans and models. Metamers refer to input stimuli that are physically different but equivalent within a given system. If a model's metameric space completely matched the human metameric space, the model would achieve functional alignment with humans. However, conventional methods lack direct ways to search for human metamers. Instead, researchers first develop biologically inspired models and then infer about human metamers indirectly by testing whether model metamers also appear as metamers to humans. Here, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Metamer Exploration (MAME) framework, enabling direct high-dimensional exploration of human metameric space. MAME leverages online image generation guided by human perceptual feedback. Specifically, it modulates reference images across multiple dimensions by leveraging hierarchical responses from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Generated images are presented to participants whose perceptual discriminability is assessed in a behavioral task. Based on participants' responses, subsequent image generation parameters are adaptively updated online. Using our MAME framework, we successfully measured a human metameric space of over fifty dimensions within a single experiment. Experimental results showed that human discrimination sensitivity was lower for metameric images based on low-level features compared to high-level features, which image contrast metrics could not explain. The finding suggests that the model computes low-level information not essential for human perception. Our framework has the potential to contribute to developing interpretable AI and understanding of brain function in neuroscience.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures | None |

With reward-enhanced diffusion distillation emerging as a promising approach that boosts controllability and fidelity of text-to-image models, we identify a fundamental paradigm shift: as conditions become more specific and reward signals stronger, the rewards themselves become the dominant force in generation. In contrast, the diffusion losses serve as an overly expensive form of regularization. To thoroughly validate our hypothesis, we introduce R0, a novel conditional generation approach via regularized reward maximization. Instead of relying on tricky diffusion distillation losses, R0 proposes a new perspective that treats image generations as an optimization problem in data space which aims to search for valid images that have high compositional rewards. By innovative designs of the generator parameterization and proper regularization techniques, we train state-of-the-art few-step text-to-image generative models with R0 at scales. Our results challenge the conventional wisdom of diffusion post-training and conditional generation by demonstrating that rewards play a dominant role in scenarios with complex conditions. We hope our findings can contribute to further research into human-centric and reward-centric generation paradigms across the broader field of AIGC.

Current methods fall short in reliably identifying unauthorized image use, as they struggle to generalize across varied generation tasks and fail when the training dataset includes images from multiple sources with few identifiable (watermarked or poisoned) samples. In this paper, we present novel evidence that diffusion-generated images faithfully preserve the statistical properties of their training data, particularly reflected in their spectral features. Leveraging this insight, we introduce \emph{CoprGuard}, a robust frequency domain watermarking framework to safeguard against unauthorized image usage in diffusion model training and fine-tuning. CoprGuard demonstrates remarkable effectiveness against a wide range of models, from naive diffusion models to sophisticated text-to-image models, and is robust even when watermarked images comprise a mere 1\% of the training dataset. This robust and versatile approach empowers content owners to protect their intellectual property in the era of AI-driven image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Recei...</summary><p>Received by CVPR 2025 (10 pages, 11 figures)</p></details> | None |

To enable more flexible image manipulation and editing, recent research has expanded from single image generation to transparent layer generation and multi-layer compositions. However, existing approaches often fail to provide a thorough exploration of multi-layer structures, leading to inconsistent inter-layer interactions, such as occlusion relationships, spatial layout, and shadowing. In this paper, we introduce DreamLayer, a novel framework that enables coherent text-driven generation of multiple image layers, by explicitly modeling the relationship between transparent foreground and background layers. DreamLayer incorporates three key components, i.e., Context-Aware Cross-Attention (CACA) for global-local information exchange, Layer-Shared Self-Attention (LSSA) for establishing robust inter-layer connections, and Information Retained Harmonization (IRH) for refining fusion details at the latent level. By leveraging a coherent full-image context, DreamLayer builds inter-layer connections through attention mechanisms and applies a harmonization step to achieve seamless layer fusion. To facilitate research in multi-layer generation, we construct a high-quality, diverse multi-layer dataset including 400k samples. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that DreamLayer generates more coherent and well-aligned layers, with broad applicability, including latent-space image editing and image-to-layer decomposition.</p></details> | Under submission | None |

Specifically, we propose to leverage an aligned Gaussian noise as implicit guidance to complement explicit user-defined inputs, such as text prompts, for better generation quality and controllability. Unlike existing noise optimization methods designed for specific models, our approach is grounded in a fundamental examination of the generic finite-step noise scheduler design in diffusion formulation, allowing better generalization across different diffusion-based architectures in a tuning-free manner. This model-agnostic nature allows us to construct a reusable noise library compatible with multiple T2I models and enhancement techniques, serving as a foundational layer for more effective generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseQuery enables fine-grained control and yields significant performance boosts not only over high-level semantics but also over low-level visual attributes, which are typically difficult to specify through text alone, with seamless integration into current workflows with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 18 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Unfortunately, acquiring high-quality stereo images remains challenging due to the precise calibration requirements of dual-camera setups and the complexity of obtaining accurate, dense disparity maps. Existing stereo image generation methods typically focus on either visual quality for viewing or geometric accuracy for matching, but not both. We introduce GenStereo, a diffusion-based approach, to bridge this gap. The method includes two primary innovations (1) conditioning the diffusion process on a disparity-aware coordinate embedding and a warped input image, allowing for more precise stereo alignment than previous methods, and (2) an adaptive fusion mechanism that intelligently combines the diffusion-generated image with a warped image, improving both realism and disparity consistency. Through extensive training on 11 diverse stereo datasets, GenStereo demonstrates strong generalization ability. GenStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stereo image generation and unsupervised stereo matching tasks.

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  | None |

However, consistent generation of high-quality images remains challenging partly due to the lack of conditioning mechanisms for perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. We show that diffusion models can learn complex qualitative relationships from both IQA models' outputs and internal activations. First, we experiment with gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this method has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel framework that conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the implicit relationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter can shift the distribution of generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain, and, inversely, it can be used as a degradation model, generating progressively more distorted images when provided with a lower-quality signal. Under high-quality condition, IQA-Adapter achieves up to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a user preference study, while preserving generative diversity and content. Furthermore, we extend IQA-Adapter to a reference-based conditioning scenario, utilizing the rich activation space of IQA models to transfer highly specific, content-agnostic qualitative features between images.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub repo: https://github.com/X1716/IQA-Adapter</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/X1716/IQA-Adapter) |

Recent training-free approaches, while exhibit higher computational efficiency than training-based methods, struggle with identity preservation, applicability, and compatibility with diffusion transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we uncover the untapped potential of DiT, where simply replacing denoising tokens with those of a reference subject achieves zero-shot subject reconstruction. This simple yet effective feature injection technique unlocks diverse scenarios, from personalization to image editing. Building upon this observation, we propose \textbf{Personalize Anything}, a training-free framework that achieves personalized image generation in DiT through: 1) timestep-adaptive token replacement that enforces subject consistency via early-stage injection and enhances flexibility through late-stage regularization, and 2) patch perturbation strategies to boost structural diversity. Our method seamlessly supports layout-guided generation, multi-subject personalization, and mask-controlled editing.

However, since these models are data-driven, they inherit biases from the training datasets, frequently leading to disproportionate group representations that exacerbate societal inequities. Traditionally, efforts to debiase these models have relied on predefined sensitive attributes, classifiers trained on such attributes, or large language models to steer outputs toward fairness. However, these approaches face notable drawbacks: predefined attributes do not adequately capture complex and continuous variations among groups. To address these issues, we introduce the Debiasing Diffusion Model (DDM), which leverages an indicator to learn latent representations during training, promoting fairness through balanced representations without requiring predefined sensitive attributes. This approach not only demonstrates its effectiveness in scenarios previously addressed by conventional techniques but also enhances fairness without relying on predefined sensitive attributes as conditions. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of prior bias mitigation techniques in diffusion-based models, elaborate on the architecture of the DDM, and validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

Existing text-to-image models for customized IDs typically focus more on ID consistency while neglecting editability. It is challenging to alter facial orientation, character attributes, and other features through prompts. EditID addresses this by deconstructing the text-to-image model for customized IDs into an image generation branch and a character feature branch. The character feature branch is further decoupled into three modules: feature extraction, feature fusion, and feature integration. By introducing a combination of mapping features and shift features, along with controlling the intensity of ID feature integration, EditID achieves semantic compression of local features across network depths, forming an editable feature space. This enables the successful generation of high-quality images with editable IDs while maintaining ID consistency, achieving excellent results in the IBench evaluation, which is an editability evaluation framework for the field of customized ID text-to-image generation that quantitatively demonstrates the superior performance of EditID. EditID is the first text-to-image solution to propose customizable ID editability on the DiT architecture, meeting the demands of long prompts and high quality image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, most approaches focus on learning robust natural image priors while modeling the scene's noise statistics. In extremely low-light conditions, these methods often remain insufficient. Additional information is needed, such as multiple captures or, as suggested here, scene description. As an alternative, we propose using a text-based description of the scene as an additional prior, something the photographer can easily provide. Inspired by the remarkable success of text-guided diffusion models in image generation, we show that adding image caption information significantly improves image denoising and reconstruction for both synthetic and real-world images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LazyMAR: Accelerating Masked Autoregressive Models via Feature Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12450v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models have emerged as a promising approach in image generation, expected to surpass traditional autoregressive models in computational efficiency by leveraging the capability of parallel decoding. However, their dependence on bidirectional self-attention inherently conflicts with conventional KV caching mechanisms, creating unexpected computational bottlenecks that undermine their expected efficiency. To address this problem, this paper studies the caching mechanism for MAR by leveraging two types of redundancy: Token Redundancy indicates that a large portion of tokens have very similar representations in the adjacent decoding steps, which allows us to first cache them in previous steps and then reuse them in the later steps. Condition Redundancy indicates that the difference between conditional and unconditional output in classifier-free guidance exhibits very similar values in adjacent steps. Based on these two redundancies, we propose LazyMAR, which introduces two caching mechanisms to handle them one by one. LazyMAR is training-free and plug-and-play for all MAR models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 2.83 times acceleration with almost no drop in generation quality. Our codes will be released in https://github.com/feihongyan1/LazyMAR.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/feihongyan1/LazyMAR) |
| **[Glauber Generative Model: Discrete Diffusion Models via Binary Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17035v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Glauber Generative Model (GGM), a new class of discrete diffusion models, to obtain new samples from a distribution given samples from a discrete space. GGM deploys a discrete Markov chain called the heat bath dynamics (or the Glauber dynamics) to denoise a sequence of noisy tokens to a sample from a joint distribution of discrete tokens. Our novel conceptual framework provides an exact reduction of the task of learning the denoising Markov chain to solving a class of binary classification tasks. More specifically, the model learns to classify a given token in a noisy sequence as signal or noise. In contrast, prior works on discrete diffusion models either solve regression problems to learn importance ratios, or minimize loss functions given by variational approximations. We apply GGM to language modeling and image generation, where images are discretized using image tokenizers like VQGANs. We show that it outperforms existing discrete diffusion models in language generation, and demonstrates strong performance for image generation without using dataset-specific image tokenizers. We also show that our model is capable of performing well in zero-shot control settings like text and image infilling.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |
| **[Reflect-DiT: Inference-Time Scaling for Text-to-Image Diffusion Transformers via In-Context Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12271v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The predominant approach to advancing text-to-image generation has been training-time scaling, where larger models are trained on more data using greater computational resources. While effective, this approach is computationally expensive, leading to growing interest in inference-time scaling to improve performance. Currently, inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models is largely limited to best-of-N sampling, where multiple images are generated per prompt and a selection model chooses the best output. Inspired by the recent success of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 in the language domain, we introduce an alternative to naive best-of-N sampling by equipping text-to-image Diffusion Transformers with in-context reflection capabilities. We propose Reflect-DiT, a method that enables Diffusion Transformers to refine their generations using in-context examples of previously generated images alongside textual feedback describing necessary improvements. Instead of passively relying on random sampling and hoping for a better result in a future generation, Reflect-DiT explicitly tailors its generations to address specific aspects requiring enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that Reflect-DiT improves performance on the GenEval benchmark (+0.19) using SANA-1.0-1.6B as a base model. Additionally, it achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 0.81 on GenEval while generating only 20 samples per prompt, surpassing the previous best score of 0.80, which was obtained using a significantly larger model (SANA-1.5-4.8B) with 2048 samples under the best-of-N approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[STAY Diffusion: Styled Layout Diffusion Model for Diverse Layout-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12213v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In layout-to-image (L2I) synthesis, controlled complex scenes are generated from coarse information like bounding boxes. Such a task is exciting to many downstream applications because the input layouts offer strong guidance to the generation process while remaining easily reconfigurable by humans. In this paper, we proposed STyled LAYout Diffusion (STAY Diffusion), a diffusion-based model that produces photo-realistic images and provides fine-grained control of stylized objects in scenes. Our approach learns a global condition for each layout, and a self-supervised semantic map for weight modulation using a novel Edge-Aware Normalization (EA Norm). A new Styled-Mask Attention (SM Attention) is also introduced to cross-condition the global condition and image feature for capturing the objects' relationships. These measures provide consistent guidance through the model, enabling more accurate and controllable image generation. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that our STAY Diffusion presents high-quality images while surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods in generation diversity, accuracy, and controllability.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 | None |

DALL.E, an advanced AI image generator, works alongside ChatGPT's language processing to transform text descriptions and image clues into realistic visual representations of the content. The study used both approaches of image generation: text-to-image and image-to-image (variation). Six types of datasets depicting fruit crop environment were generated. These AI-generated images were then compared against ground truth images captured by sensors in real agricultural fields. The comparison was based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) metrics. The image-to-image generation exhibited a 5.78% increase in average PSNR over text-to-image methods, signifying superior image clarity and quality. However, this method also resulted in a 10.23% decrease in average FSIM, indicating a diminished structural and textural similarity to the original images. Similar to these measures, human evaluation also showed that images generated using image-to-image-based method were more realistic compared to those generated with text-to-image approach. The results highlighted DALL.E's potential in generating realistic agricultural image datasets and thus accelerating the development and adoption of imaging-based precision agricultural solutions. In future, DALL.E along with other alternative LLM based image generation models such as MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, Craiyon, Imagen, Parti, DreamStudio, Make-A-Scene, DeepDream, and VQ-GAN + CLIP could demonstrate further significant potential for enhancing image clarity, quality, and realism in depicting agricultural environments, which could revolutionize precision farming practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Fig...</summary><p>9 Figures, 1 table, 19 pages</p></details> | None |
| **[FAILS: A Framework for Automated Collection and Analysis of LLM Service Incidents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12185v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) services such as ChatGPT, DALLE, and Cursor have quickly become essential for society, businesses, and individuals, empowering applications such as chatbots, image generation, and code assistance. The complexity of LLM systems makes them prone to failures and affects their reliability and availability, yet their failure patterns are not fully understood, making it an emerging problem. However, there are limited datasets and studies in this area, particularly lacking an open-access tool for analyzing LLM service failures based on incident reports. Addressing these problems, in this work we propose FAILS, the first open-sourced framework for incident reports collection and analysis on different LLM services and providers. FAILS provides comprehensive data collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities, including:(1) It can automatically collect, clean, and update incident data through its data scraper and processing components;(2) It provides 17 types of failure analysis, allowing users to explore temporal trends of incidents, analyze service reliability metrics, such as Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF);(3) It leverages advanced LLM tools to assist in data analysis and interpretation, enabling users to gain observations and insights efficiently. All functions are integrated in the backend, allowing users to easily access them through a web-based frontend interface. FAILS supports researchers, engineers, and general users to understand failure patterns and further mitigate operational incidents and outages in LLM services. The framework is publicly available on https://github.com/atlarge-research/FAILS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/atlarge-research/FAILS) |

LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system and a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as input and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG's key challenge is that due to the projector's physical brightness limitation and the surface texture, the viewer's perceived projection may suffer from color saturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with the state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see clear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector image that follows the user's instruction while also displaying minimum surface artifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection surface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We first train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and project-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector image without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast convergence. Then, we design content and saturation losses to guide the projector image generation, such that the generated image shows no clearly perceivable artifacts when projected. Finally, the generated image is projected for visually pleasing surface style morphing effects. The source code and video are available on the project page: https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG/.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG) |
| **[SEAL: Semantic Aware Image Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12172v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have rapidly evolved to generate realistic outputs. However, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction between natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking techniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the target image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication onto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent watermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise. Yet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely on searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection. In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic information about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a distortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of key patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic embedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore, conditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves robustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two largely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial noise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker inserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image, possibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's increased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that content-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DiffAD: A Unified Diffusion Modeling Approach for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12170v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has rapidly emerged as a promising approach toward achieving full autonomy. However, existing E2E-AD systems typically adopt a traditional multi-task framework, addressing perception, prediction, and planning tasks through separate task-specific heads. Despite being trained in a fully differentiable manner, they still encounter issues with task coordination, and the system complexity remains high. In this work, we introduce DiffAD, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that redefines autonomous driving as a conditional image generation task. By rasterizing heterogeneous targets onto a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) and modeling their latent distribution, DiffAD unifies various driving objectives and jointly optimizes all driving tasks in a single framework, significantly reducing system complexity and harmonizing task coordination. The reverse process iteratively refines the generated BEV image, resulting in more robust and realistic driving behaviors. Closed-loop evaluations in Carla demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, achieving a new state-of-the-art Success Rate and Driving Score. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

Despite promising empirical results, the contextual coherence between different attributes has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we argue that subsequent attributes should follow the multivariable conditional distribution introduced by former attribute creation. In light of this, we reformulate multi-attribute creation from a conditional probability theory perspective and tackle the challenging zero-shot setting. By explicitly modeling the dependencies between attributes, we further enhance the coherence of generated images across diverse attribute combinations. Furthermore, we identify connections between multi-attribute customization and multi-task learning, effectively addressing the high computing cost encountered in multi-attribute synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Z-Magic outperforms existing models in zero-shot image generation, with broad implications for AI-driven design and creative applications.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

In scenarios with limited data, GANs often struggle with discriminator overfitting and unstable training. Batch Normalization (BN), despite being known for enhancing generalization and training stability, has rarely been used in the discriminator of Data-Efficient GANs. Our work addresses this gap by identifying a critical flaw in BN: the tendency for gradient explosion during the centering and scaling steps. To tackle this issue, we present CHAIN (lipsCHitz continuity constrAIned Normalization), which replaces the conventional centering step with zero-mean regularization and integrates a Lipschitz continuity constraint in the scaling step. CHAIN further enhances GAN training by adaptively interpolating the normalized and unnormalized features, effectively avoiding discriminator overfitting. Our theoretical analyses firmly establishes CHAIN's effectiveness in reducing gradients in latent features and weights, improving stability and generalization in GAN training. Empirical evidence supports our theory. CHAIN achieves state-of-the-art results in data-limited scenarios on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, five low-shot and seven high-resolution few-shot image datasets.

We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families. This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images. We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

We present SoftVQ-VAE, a continuous image tokenizer that leverages soft categorical posteriors to aggregate multiple codewords into each latent token, substantially increasing the representation capacity of the latent space. When applied to Transformer-based architectures, our approach compresses 256x256 and 512x512 images using as few as 32 or 64 1-dimensional tokens. Not only does SoftVQ-VAE show consistent and high-quality reconstruction, more importantly, it also achieves state-of-the-art and significantly faster image generation results across different denoising-based generative models. Remarkably, SoftVQ-VAE improves inference throughput by up to 18x for generating 256x256 images and 55x for 512x512 images while achieving competitive FID scores of 1.78 and 2.21 for SiT-XL. It also improves the training efficiency of the generative models by reducing the number of training iterations by 2.3x while maintaining comparable performance. With its fully-differentiable design and semantic-rich latent space, our experiment demonstrates that SoftVQ-VAE achieves efficient tokenization without compromising generation quality, paving the way for more efficient generative models.

Many attempts have been made to adopt text-to-image models to support multiple tasks. However, existing approaches typically require resource-intensive re-training or additional parameters to accommodate for the new tasks, which makes the model inefficient for on-device deployment. We propose Multi-Task Upcycling (MTU), a simple yet effective recipe that extends the capabilities of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to support a variety of image-to-image generation tasks. MTU replaces Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in the diffusion model with smaller FFNs, referred to as experts, and combines them with a dynamic routing mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, MTU is the first multi-task diffusion modeling approach that seamlessly blends multi-tasking with on-device compatibility, by mitigating the issue of parameter inflation. We show that the performance of MTU is on par with the single-task fine-tuned diffusion models across several tasks including image editing, super-resolution, and inpainting, while maintaining similar latency and computational load (GFLOPs) as the single-task fine-tuned models.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

We evaluate a range of DiT-based architectures--including PixArt-style and MMDiT variants--and compare them with a standard DiT variant which directly processes concatenated text and noise inputs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that the performance of standard DiT is comparable with those specialized models, while demonstrating superior parameter-efficiency, especially when scaled up. Leveraging the layer-wise parameter sharing strategy, we achieve a further reduction of 66% in model size compared to an MMDiT architecture, with minimal performance impact. Building on an in-depth analysis of critical components such as text encoders and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we introduce DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite. With supervised and reward fine-tuning, DiT-Air achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval and T2I CompBench, while DiT-Air-Lite remains highly competitive, surpassing most existing models despite its compact size.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we propose to explore a new use case, namely to copy black-box classification models without having access to the original training data, the architecture, and the weights of the model, i.e. the model is only exposed through an inference API. More specifically, we can only observe the (soft or hard) labels for some image samples passed as input to the model. Furthermore, we consider an additional constraint limiting the number of model calls, mostly focusing our research on few-call model stealing. In order to solve the model extraction task given the applied restrictions, we propose the following framework. As training data, we create a synthetic data set (called proxy data set) by leveraging the ability of diffusion models to generate realistic and diverse images. Given a maximum number of allowed API calls, we pass the respective number of samples through the black-box model to collect labels. Finally, we distill the knowledge of the black-box teacher (attacked model) into a student model (copy of the attacked model), harnessing both labeled and unlabeled data generated by the diffusion model. We employ a novel active self-paced learning framework to make the most of the proxy data during distillation. Our empirical results on three data sets confirm the superiority of our framework over four state-of-the-art methods in the few-call model extraction scenario.

This misalignment is not revealed by common evaluation metrics such as CLIPScore. Recent works have proposed evaluation metrics that utilize Visual Question Answering (VQA) by decomposing prompts into questions about the generated image for more robust compositional evaluation. Although these methods align better with human evaluations, they still fail to fully cover the compositionality within the image. To address this, we propose a novel metric that breaks down images into components, and texts into fine-grained questions about the generated image for evaluation. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in evaluating text-to-image generative models.

However, their performance notably declines when generating images at resolutions higher than those used during the training period. Despite the existence of numerous methods for producing high-resolution images, they either suffer from inefficiency or are hindered by complex operations. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, an straightforward and efficient solution for training-free high-resolution image generation. Specifically, we introduce the noise refresh strategy, which theoretically only requires a few lines of code to unlock the model's high-resolution generation ability and improve efficiency. Additionally, we first observe the phenomenon of energy decay that may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution image generation process. To address this issue, we introduce average latent energy analysis and discover that an improved classifier-free guidance hyperparameter can significantly enhance generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and boasts a simple implementation logic and efficient performance.

However, invisible watermarking for visual autoregressive (VAR) models remains underexplored, despite its importance in misuse prevention. Existing watermarking methods, designed for diffusion models, often struggle to adapt to the sequential nature of VAR models. To bridge this gap, we propose Safe-VAR, the first watermarking framework specifically designed for autoregressive text-to-image generation. Our study reveals that the timing of watermark injection significantly impacts generation quality, and watermarks of different complexities exhibit varying optimal injection times. Motivated by this observation, we propose an Adaptive Scale Interaction Module, which dynamically determines the optimal watermark embedding strategy based on the watermark information and the visual characteristics of the generated image. This ensures watermark robustness while minimizing its impact on image quality. Furthermore, we introduce a Cross-Scale Fusion mechanism, which integrates mixture of both heads and experts to effectively fuse multi-resolution features and handle complex interactions between image content and watermark patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that Safe-VAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing counterparts regarding image quality, watermarking fidelity, and robustness against perturbations. Moreover, our method exhibits strong generalization to an out-of-domain watermark dataset QR Codes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Continuous, Subject-Specific Attribute Control in T2I Models by Identifying Semantic Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17064v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have significantly improved the quality of generated images. However, providing efficient control over individual subjects, particularly the attributes characterizing them, remains a key challenge. While existing methods have introduced mechanisms to modulate attribute expression, they typically provide either detailed, object-specific localization of such a modification or full-scale fine-grained, nuanced control of attributes. No current approach offers both simultaneously, resulting in a gap when trying to achieve precise continuous and subject-specific attribute modulation in image generation. In this work, we demonstrate that token-level directions exist within commonly used CLIP text embeddings that enable fine-grained, subject-specific control of high-level attributes in T2I models. We introduce two methods to identify these directions: a simple, optimization-free technique and a learning-based approach that utilizes the T2I model to characterize semantic concepts more specifically. Our methods allow the augmentation of the prompt text input, enabling fine-grained control over multiple attributes of individual subjects simultaneously, without requiring any modifications to the diffusion model itself. This approach offers a unified solution that fills the gap between global and localized control, providing competitive flexibility and precision in text-guided image generation.

| **[CreatiLayout: Siamese Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Creative Layout-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03859v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been recognized for their ability to generate images that are not only visually appealing but also of high artistic quality. As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (e.g., SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To Inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. Our code, model, and dataset will be available at https://creatilayout.github.io.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Decouple-Then-Merge: Finetune Diffusion Models as Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06664v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are trained by learning a sequence of models that reverse each step of noise corruption. Typically, the model parameters are fully shared across multiple timesteps to enhance training efficiency. However, since the denoising tasks differ at each timestep, the gradients computed at different timesteps may conflict, potentially degrading the overall performance of image generation. To solve this issue, this work proposes a \textbf{De}couple-then-\textbf{Me}rge (\textbf{DeMe}) framework, which begins with a pretrained model and finetunes separate models tailored to specific timesteps. We introduce several improved techniques during the finetuning stage to promote effective knowledge sharing while minimizing training interference across timesteps. Finally, after finetuning, these separate models can be merged into a single model in the parameter space, ensuring efficient and practical inference. Experimental results show significant generation quality improvements upon 6 benchmarks including Stable Diffusion on COCO30K, ImageNet1K, PartiPrompts, and DDPM on LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, and CIFAR10.
