However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors; (2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.</p></details> |  | None |

Skywork UniPic achieves a GenEval score of 0.86, surpassing most existing unified models; sets a new DPG-Bench complex-generation record of 85.5; attains 5.83 on GEditBench-EN and 3.49 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing; and generates 1024 x 1024 images with under 15 GB of GPU memory (e.g., RTX 4090). (1) a decoupled encoding strategy that leverages a masked autoregressive encoder for synthesis and a SigLIP2 encoder for understanding, all feeding a shared autoregressive decoder; (2) a progressive, resolution-aware training schedule scaling from 256 x 256 to 1024 x 1024 while dynamically unfreezing parameters to balance capacity and stability; and (3) meticulously curated, 100 million-scale datasets augmented with task-specific reward models to refine generation and editing objectives. By demonstrating that high-fidelity multimodal integration need not incur prohibitive resource demands, Skywork UniPic establishes a practical paradigm for deployable, high-fidelity multimodal AI.

With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at A&A; 18+6 pages; 12+6 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[FFHQ-Makeup: Paired Synthetic Makeup Dataset with Facial Consistency Across Multiple Styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03241v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression, undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://yangxingchao.github.io/FFHQ-Makeup-page, Datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyberagent/FFHQ-Makeup</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yangxingchao.github.io/FFHQ-Makeup-page) |
| **[NAMI: Efficient Image Generation via Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09242v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation performance, but often suffer from high inference latency and computational cost due to their large parameter sizes. To improve inference efficiency without compromising quality, we propose Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow Transformers (NAMI), which decompose the generation process across temporal, spatial, and architectural demensions. We divide the rectified flow into different stages according to resolution, and use a BridgeFlow module to connect them. Fewer Transformer layers are used at low-resolution stages to generate image layouts and concept contours, and more layers are progressively added as the resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves fast convergence and reduces inference time while ensuring generation quality. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow Transformers that enable multi-resolution training, accelerating model convergence; (2) NAMI leverages piecewise flow and spatial cascading of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to rapidly generate images, reducing inference time by 64% for generating 1024 resolution images; (3) We propose a BridgeFlow module to align flows between different stages; (4) We propose the NAMI-1K benchmark to evaluate human preference performance, aiming to mitigate distributional bias and comprehensively assess model effectiveness. The results show that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Content: How Grammatical Gender Shapes Visual Representation in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03199v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models. Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\% on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects. Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[JointDiT: Enhancing RGB-Depth Joint Modeling with Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00482v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, namely, adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timesteps of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a viable alternative to conditional generation.

| **[UniEdit-I: Training-free Image Editing for Unified VLM via Iterative Understanding, Editing and Verifying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03142v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced, effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices, the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image. The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps: understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3. The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop. This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence, delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UFEval: Unified Fine-grained Evaluation with Task and Aspect Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12795v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the open-ended outputs of Large Multimodal Models has become a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality rapidly expand. Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in specific tasks and aspects. In this paper, we argue that, on one hand, based on the interconnected nature of aspects, learning specific aspects can generalize to unseen aspects; on the other hand, jointly learning to assess multiple visual aspects and tasks may foster a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose UFEval, the first unified fine-grained evaluator with task and aspect generalization for four evaluation tasks -- Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Specifically, (1) We first construct a hierarchical aspect taxonomy encompassing 112 distinct aspects across the aforementioned four tasks. (2) Then, building upon this taxonomy, we create FRABench, a fine-grained evaluation dataset comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k evaluation labels obtained from a combination of human and GPT-4o annotations. FRABench provides a large-scale, multi-modal, and aspect-level resource for training and testing evaluators. (3) Finally, leveraging FRABench, we develop UFEval, a unified fine-grained evaluator. Experiments show that learning on specific aspects enables UFEval to generalize to unseen aspects, and joint learning to assess diverse tasks and aspects can lead to substantial mutual benefits.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior detection methods have focused on filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

We extend our previous work on exoticism (Ghosh et al., 2024) of 'Global South' countries from across the world, as depicted by GAI tools. We analyze generated images of individuals from 13 countries -- India, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Sudan, Libya, Venezuela, Colombia, Indonesia, Honduras, and Mexico -- performing everyday activities (such as being at home, going to work, getting groceries, etc.), as opposed to images for the same activities being performed by persons from 3 'Global North' countries -- USA, UK, Australia. While outputs for 'Global North' demonstrate a difference across images and people clad in activity-appropriate attire, individuals from 'Global South' countries are depicted in similar attire irrespective of the performed activity, indicative of a pattern of exoticism where attire or other cultural features are overamplified at the cost of accuracy. We further show qualitatively-analyzed case studies that demonstrate how exoticism is not simply performed upon 'Global South' countries but also upon marginalized populations even in Western contexts, as we observe a similar exoticization of Indigenous populations in the 'Global North', and doubly upon marginalized populations within 'Global South' countries. We document implications for harm-aware usage patterns of such tools, and steps towards designing better GAI tools through community-centered endeavors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upcom...</summary><p>Upcoming Publication, AIES 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DRC: Enhancing Personalized Image Generation via Disentangled Representation Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17349v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics. To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM MM'25</p></details> | None |
| **[SEAL: Semantic Aware Image Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12172v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have rapidly evolved to generate realistic outputs. However, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction between natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking techniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the target image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication onto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent watermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise. Yet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely on searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection. In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic information about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a distortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of key patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic embedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore, conditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves robustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two largely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial noise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker inserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image, possibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's increased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that content-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Qwen-Image Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02324v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection, filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering, evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result, Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image) |

While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized adapter integration.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt. This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer, generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance. Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting the image prompt.</p></details> |  | None |

While traditional style transfer methods and modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) strive to achieve this balance, they often struggle to do so without sacrificing either style, content, or sometimes both. This work addresses this challenge by analyzing the ability of DDPMs to maintain content and style equilibrium. We introduce a novel method to identify sensitivities within the DDPM attention layers, identifying specific layers that correspond to different stylistic aspects. By directing conditional inputs only to these sensitive layers, our approach enables fine-grained control over style and content, significantly reducing issues arising from over-constrained inputs. Our findings demonstrate that this method enhances recent stylization techniques by better aligning style and content, ultimately improving the quality of generated visual content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper at CVPR 2025.

Classical approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D}, a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Efficient4D: Fast Dynamic 3D Object Generation from a Single-view Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08742v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating dynamic 3D object from a single-view video is challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. An intuitive approach is to extend previous image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling.However, this approach would be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly reconstruct the 4D content through a 4D Gaussian splatting model. Importantly, our method can achieve real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. To enable robust reconstruction under sparse views, we introduce inconsistency-aware confidence-weighted loss design, along with a lightly weighted score distillation loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 10 minutes to model a dynamic object, vs 120 minutes by the previous art model Consistent4D.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[Scendi Score: Prompt-Aware Diversity Evaluation via Schur Complement of CLIP Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18645v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the fidelity of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the alignment of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which are responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts, which we refer to as prompt-aware diversity. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the Schur Complement ENtopy DIversity (Scendi) score, as a measure of the prompt-aware diversity for prompt-guided generative models. Additionally, we discuss the application of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt on the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of the embedded vectors on specific objects. We present several numerical results that apply our proposed Scendi score to evaluate text-to-image and LLM (text-to-text) models. Our numerical results indicate the success of the Scendi score in capturing the intrinsic diversity of prompt-guided generative models.

Existing attack methods suffer from critical limitations: 1) they rely on unnatural adversarial prompts that lack human readability and require massive poisoned data; 2) their effectiveness is typically restricted to specific models, lacking generalizability; and 3) they can be mitigated by recent backdoor defenses. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel backdoor attack framework that achieves three key properties: 1) \emph{Practicality}: Our attack requires only a few stealthy backdoor samples to generate arbitrary attacker-chosen target images, as well as ensuring high-quality image generation in benign scenarios. 2) \emph{Generalizability:} The attack is applicable across multiple T2I DMs without requiring model-specific redesign. 3) \emph{Robustness:} The attack remains effective against existing backdoor defenses and adaptive defenses. Our extensive experimental results on multiple T2I DMs demonstrate that with only 10 carefully crafted backdoored samples, our attack method achieves $>$90\% attack success rate with negligible degradation in benign image generation quality. We also conduct human evaluation to validate our attack effectiveness. Furthermore, recent backdoor detection and mitigation methods, as well as adaptive defense tailored to our attack are not sufficiently effective, highlighting the pressing need for more robust defense mechanisms against the proposed attack.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status, thereby potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes and shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, and Asian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background) during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes, thereby maintaining the original model's output distribution and generative capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance for SSC, surpassing most existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025), Hangzhou, China, Oct 2025</p></details> | None |

The advent of powerful artificial intelligence models that can generate and analyze images creates new challenges for painting attribution. On the one hand, AI models can create images that mimic the style of a painter, which can be incorrectly attributed, for example, by other AI models. On the other hand, AI models may not be able to correctly identify the artist for real paintings, inducing users to incorrectly attribute paintings. In this paper, both problems are experimentally studied using state-of-the-art AI models for image generation and analysis on a large dataset with close to 40,000 paintings from 128 artists. The results show that vision language models have limited capabilities to: 1) perform canvas attribution and 2) to identify AI generated images. As users increasingly rely on queries to AI models to get information, these results show the need to improve the capabilities of VLMs to reliably perform artist attribution and detection of AI generated images to prevent the spread of incorrect information.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PromptSafe: Gated Prompt Tuning for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01272v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality, but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%), while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy, thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SketchAgent: Generating Structured Diagrams from Hand-Drawn Sketches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01237v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering, while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive sketching and machine-readable diagram generation.

Furthermore, most existing text-to-image models rely on large-scale, high-quality private datasets, making them challenging to replicate. In this work, we introduce Text-Aware Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TA-TiTok), an efficient and powerful image tokenizer that can utilize either discrete or continuous 1-dimensional tokens. TA-TiTok uniquely integrates textual information during the tokenizer decoding stage (i.e., de-tokenization), accelerating convergence and enhancing performance. TA-TiTok also benefits from a simplified, yet effective, one-stage training process, eliminating the need for the complex two-stage distillation used in previous 1-dimensional tokenizers. This design allows for seamless scalability to large datasets. Building on this, we introduce a family of text-to-image Masked Generative Models (MaskGen), trained exclusively on open data while achieving comparable performance to models trained on private data. We aim to release both the efficient, strong TA-TiTok tokenizers and the open-data, open-weight MaskGen models to promote broader access and democratize the field of text-to-image masked generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families. This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images. We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ASPLOS'26</p></details> | None |

Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Joint Generative Modeling of Grounded Scene Graphs and Images via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01130v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for joint grounded scene graph - image generation, a challenging task involving high-dimensional, multi-modal structured data. To effectively model this complex joint distribution, we adopt a factorized approach: first generating a grounded scene graph, followed by image generation conditioned on the generated grounded scene graph. While conditional image generation has been widely explored in the literature, our primary focus is on the generation of grounded scene graphs from noise, which provides efficient and interpretable control over the image generation process. This task requires generating plausible grounded scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for both nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), encompassing continuous attributes (e.g., object bounding boxes) and discrete attributes (e.g., object and relation categories). To address this challenge, we introduce DiffuseSG, a novel diffusion model that jointly models the heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore different encoding strategies to effectively handle the categorical data. Leveraging a graph transformer as the denoiser, DiffuseSG progressively refines grounded scene graph representations in a continuous space before discretizing them to generate structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce an IoU-based regularization term to enhance empirical performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in grounded scene graph generation on the VG and COCO-Stuff datasets, excelling in both standard and newly introduced metrics that more accurately capture the task's complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broader applicability of DiffuseSG in two important downstream tasks: 1) achieving superior results in a range of grounded scene graph completion tasks, and 2) enhancing grounded scene graph detection models by leveraging additional training samples generated by DiffuseSG.</p></details> |  | None |

This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity, and aesthetic quality.

Most existing methods fall in the joint diffusion paradigm, but their complex and heuristic crop connection designs often limit their ability to achieve multilevel coherence. By deconstructing this challenge into its core components, we find it naturally aligns with next-token prediction, leading us to adopt an autoregressive (AR) paradigm for PIG modeling. However, existing visual AR (VAR) models are limited to fixed-size generation, lacking the capability to produce panoramic images. In this paper, we propose PanoLlama, a novel framework that achieves endless and coherent panorama generation with the autoregressive paradigm. Our approach develops a training-free strategy that utilizes token redirection to overcome the size limitations of existing VAR models, enabling next-crop prediction in both horizontal and vertical directions. This refreshes the PIG pipeline while achieving SOTA performance in coherence (47.50%), fidelity(28.16%), and aesthetics (15%). Additionally, PanoLlama supports applications other PIG methods cannot achieve, including mask-free layout control, multi-scale and multi-guidance synthesis. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we also establish a dataset with 1,000 prompts spanning 100+ themes, providing a new testing benchmark for PIG research.

Specifically, we propose to leverage an aligned Gaussian noise as implicit guidance to complement explicit user-defined inputs, such as text prompts, for better generation quality and controllability. Unlike existing noise optimization methods designed for specific models, our approach is grounded in a fundamental examination of the generic finite-step noise scheduler design in diffusion formulation, allowing better generalization across different diffusion-based architectures in a tuning-free manner. This model-agnostic nature allows us to construct a reusable noise library compatible with multiple T2I models and enhancement techniques, serving as a foundational layer for more effective generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseQuery enables fine-grained control and yields significant performance boosts not only over high-level semantics but also over low-level visual attributes, which are typically difficult to specify through text alone, with seamless integration into current workflows with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight | None |

However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality. However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling results than DC-AE.

However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover, our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.00837</p></details> | None |

AttnMod simulates this intent by altering how the text prompt conditions the image through attention during denoising.

We introduce InvMM, an inversion-based measure of memorization, which is based on inverting a sensitive latent noise distribution accounting for the replication of an image. For accurate estimation of the measure, we propose an adaptive algorithm that balances the normality and sensitivity of the noise distribution. Comprehensive experiments across four datasets, conducted on both unconditional and text-guided diffusion models, demonstrate that InvMM provides a reliable and complete quantification of memorization. Notably, InvMM is commensurable between samples, reveals the true extent of memorization from an adversarial standpoint and implies how memorization differs from membership. In practice, it serves as an auditing tool for developers to reliably assess the risk of memorization, thereby contributing to the enhancement of trustworthiness and privacy-preserving capabilities of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

While mask-controllable diffusion models excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation. Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used, enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves 2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

| **[DivControl: Knowledge Diversion for Controllable Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23620v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image (I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps, enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior scalability, modularity, and transferability.</p></details> |  | None |

Improving digital literacy can help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while maintaining trust in truthful information.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification. Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/UniEmo.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/UniEmo) |

The analy- sis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Insights into Closed-form IPM-GAN Discriminator Guidance for Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01654v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are a state-of-the-art generative modeling framework that transform noise to images via Langevin sampling, guided by the score, which is the gradient of the logarithm of the data distribution. Recent works have shown empirically that the generation quality can be improved when guided by classifier network, which is typically the discriminator trained in a generative adversarial network (GAN) setting. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of the GAN discriminator on Langevin-based sampling, and show that the IPM-GAN optimization can be seen as one of smoothed score-matching, wherein the scores of the data and the generator distributions are convolved with the kernel function associated with the IPM. The proposed approach serves to unify score-based training and optimization of IPM-GANs. Based on these insights, we demonstrate that closed-form kernel-based discriminator guidance, results in improvements (in terms of CLIP-FID and KID metrics) when applied atop baseline diffusion models. We demonstrate these results on the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and latent diffusion model (LDM) settings on various standard datasets. We also show that the proposed approach can be combined with existing accelerated-diffusion techniques to improve latent-space image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous CLIP-based unified methods often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain original comprehension performance while achieving effective image reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks, UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Our work first identifies the root causes of the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail, learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models are available for research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/x-nemo-inference</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/bytedance/x-nemo-inference) |

While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities. Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens. These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DO-EM: Density Operator Expectation Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22786v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models (\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data, such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However, designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a \textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a 40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 9 pages 1 Figure.

While diffusion-based models produce high-quality images, their extensive denoising steps result in significant computational overhead, limiting real-world applicability. Visual autoregressive (VAR) models, which predict next-scale tokens rather than spatially adjacent ones, offer significantly faster inference suitable for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose the first VAR-based approach for subject-driven generation. However, naive fine-tuning VAR leads to computational overhead, language drift, and reduced diversity. To address these challenges, we introduce selective layer tuning to reduce complexity and prior distillation to mitigate language drift. Additionally, we found that the early stages have a greater influence on the generation of subject than the latter stages, which merely synthesize minor details. Based on this finding, we propose scale-wise weighted tuning, which prioritizes coarser resolutions for promoting the model to focus on the subject-relevant information instead of local details. Extensive experiments validate that our method significantly outperforms diffusion-based baselines across various metrics and demonstrates its practical usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Multi-Conditioning for Image Generation via Sketch-Text Pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22627v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material, texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its unprecedented level of design customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV25 (Oral).

A common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments. Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are sufficiently dissimilar.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |

While employing individual pre-trained LoRA models excels at representing single concepts, such as those representing a specific dog or a cat, utilizing multiple LoRA models to capture a variety of concepts in a single image still poses a significant challenge. Existing methods often fall short, primarily because the attention mechanisms within different LoRA models overlap, leading to scenarios where one concept may be completely ignored (e.g., omitting the dog) or where concepts are incorrectly combined (e.g., producing an image of two cats instead of one cat and one dog). We introduce CLoRA, a training-free approach that addresses these limitations by updating the attention maps of multiple LoRA models at test-time, and leveraging the attention maps to create semantic masks for fusing latent representations. This enables the generation of composite images that accurately reflect the characteristics of each LoRA. Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that CLoRA significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-concept image generation using LoRAs.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics, Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains 40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to enhance overall performance.

Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.</p></details> |  | None |

However, LVLMs frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure. These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning, allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and visual-semantic alignment.

Data-free quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored. Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose \textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore, it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation (W2A4) quantization.</p></details> |  | None |

However, maintaining temporal consistency and motion alignment still remains challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes DINO-guided Video Editing (DIVE), a framework designed to facilitate subject-driven editing in source videos conditioned on either target text prompts or reference images with specific identities. The core of DIVE lies in leveraging the powerful semantic features extracted from a pretrained DINOv2 model as implicit correspondences to guide the editing process. Specifically, to ensure temporal motion consistency, DIVE employs DINO features to align with the motion trajectory of the source video. For precise subject editing, DIVE incorporates the DINO features of reference images into a pretrained text-to-image model to learn Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs), effectively registering the target subject's identity. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world videos demonstrate that our framework can achieve high-quality editing results with robust motion consistency, highlighting the potential of DINO to contribute to video editing.

In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time.

| **[APT: Improving Diffusion Models for High Resolution Image Generation with Adaptive Path Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21690v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions, limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While training-based approaches address this limitation by training on high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently, training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their generalization to real-world scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated real-world stereo data. In this paper, we propose ZeroStereo, a novel stereo image generation pipeline for zero-shot stereo matching. Our approach synthesizes high-quality right images from arbitrary single images by leveraging pseudo disparities generated by a monocular depth estimation model. Unlike previous methods that address occluded regions by filling missing areas with neighboring pixels or random backgrounds, we fine-tune a diffusion inpainting model to recover missing details while preserving semantic structure. Additionally, we propose Training-Free Confidence Generation, which mitigates the impact of unreliable pseudo labels without additional training, and Adaptive Disparity Selection, which ensures a diverse and realistic disparity distribution while preventing excessive occlusion and foreground distortion. Experiments demonstrate that models trained with our pipeline achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets with only a dataset volume comparable to Scene Flow.

However, most existing works focus on generating images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |

We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight).

Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail (minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled samples.</p></details> | PhD Thesis | None |
| **[Model-Agnostic Gender Bias Control for Text-to-Image Generation via Sparse Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20973v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs. Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents an enhancement to DeepChem, a widely used open-source drug discovery framework, through the integration of DeepVariant. In particular, we introduce a variant calling pipeline that leverages DeepVariant's convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to improve the accuracy and reliability of variant detection. The implemented pipeline includes stages for realignment of sequencing reads, candidate variant detection, and pileup image generation, followed by variant classification using a modified Inception v3 model. Our work adds a modular and extensible variant calling framework to the DeepChem framework and enables future work integrating DeepChem's drug discovery infrastructure more tightly with bioinformatics pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring text-to-image generation for historical document image retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20934v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE, which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents. Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at utilizing T2I generation for DIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented as an extended abstract (double-blind review process) at the 2025 Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA). 4 pages</p></details> | None |

These tools pose a serious threat to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages, and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms, such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for detection algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCB 2025; for project page, see https://www.idiap.ch/paper/fantasyid</p></details> | None |

However, critical questions remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen, using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB), 2025</p></details> | None |

Thus, it remains unclear whether these models can accurately represent a wide variety of realistic visual entities. To bridge this gap, we propose KITTEN, a benchmark for Knowledge-InTensive image generaTion on real-world ENtities. Using KITTEN, we conduct a systematic study of the latest text-to-image models and retrieval-augmented models, focusing on their ability to generate real-world visual entities, such as landmarks and animals. Analysis using carefully designed human evaluations, automatic metrics, and MLLM evaluations show that even advanced text-to-image models fail to generate accurate visual details of entities. While retrieval-augmented models improve entity fidelity by incorporating reference images, they tend to over-rely on them and struggle to create novel configurations of the entity in creative text prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kitten-project.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Hot-Swap MarkBoard: An Efficient Black-box Watermarking Approach for Large-scale Model Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20650v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy. However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP) risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving 100\% verification accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Frequency-Aware Autoregressive Modeling for Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20454v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm, exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.</p></details> |  | None |

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025.

However, in this paper, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach incorporates two key coordinated components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to construct the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art attacks, achieving at least a +30.1% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |

How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.

However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper, we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics, offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 8 figures, pre-print</p></details> | None |

As these tools begin to influence how agricultural data is visualized and disseminated, the sector's diversity spanning both technical and non-technical researchers, demands a rigorous foundational study to demystify the image generation process. This research investigated the role of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the DALL.E model by OpenAI, in advancing data generation and visualization techniques in agriculture. DALL.E, an advanced AI image generator, works alongside ChatGPT's language processing to transform text descriptions and image clues into realistic visual representations of the content. The study used both approaches of image generation: text-to-image and image-to-image (variation). Six types of datasets depicting fruit crop environment were generated. These AI-generated images were then compared against ground truth images captured by sensors in real agricultural fields. The comparison was based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) metrics. The image-to-image generation exhibited a 5.78% increase in average PSNR over text-to-image methods, signifying superior image clarity and quality. However, this method also resulted in a 10.23% decrease in average FSIM, indicating a diminished structural and textural similarity to the original images. Similar to these measures, human evaluation also showed that images generated using image-to-image-based method were more realistic compared to those generated with text-to-image approach. The results highlighted DALL.E's potential in generating realistic agricultural image datasets and thus accelerating the development and adoption of imaging-based precision agricultural solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs. While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

We present CLIP-JEM, a novel approach extending JEMs to the multimodal vision-language domain using CLIP, integrating both generative and discriminative objectives. For the generative one, we introduce an image-text joint-energy function based on Cosine similarity in the CLIP space, training CLIP to assign low energy to real image-caption pairs and high energy otherwise. For the discriminative one, we employ contrastive adversarial loss, extending the adversarial training objective to the multimodal domain. CLIP-JEM not only generates realistic images from text but also achieves competitive results on the compositionality benchmark, outperforming leading methods with fewer parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior guidance capability of CLIP-JEM by enhancing CLIP-based generative frameworks and converting unconditional diffusion models to text-based ones. Lastly, we show that our model can serve as a more robust evaluation metric for text-to-image generative tasks than CLIP.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR | None |
| **[End-to-End Fine-Tuning of 3D Texture Generation using Differentiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18331v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent 3D generative models can produce high-quality texture images, they often fail to capture human preferences or meet task-specific requirements. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain is that most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To alleviate these issues, we propose an end-to-end differentiable, reinforcement-learning-free framework that embeds human feedback, expressed as differentiable reward functions, directly into the 3D texture synthesis pipeline. By back-propagating preference signals through both geometric and appearance modules of the proposed framework, our method generates textures that respect the 3D geometry structure and align with desired criteria. To demonstrate its versatility, we introduce three novel geometry-aware reward functions, which offer a more controllable and interpretable pathway for creating high-quality 3D content from natural language. By conducting qualitative, quantitative, and user-preference evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our proposed strategy consistently outperforms existing approaches. We will make our implementation code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |

To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[Defining ethically sourced code generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19743v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing, privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices. To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen. Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called \emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

Despite shared architecture and learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally lower fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating harmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety remains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing.

However, existing evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic preferences.

To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do Existing Testing Tools Really Uncover Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15775v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality images and are consequently used in a wide range of applications. However, there are concerns about the gender bias of these models. Previous studies have shown that T2I models can perpetuate or even amplify gender stereotypes when provided with neutral text prompts. Researchers have proposed automated gender bias uncovering detectors for T2I models, but a crucial gap exists: no existing work comprehensively compares the various detectors and understands how the gender bias detected by them deviates from the actual situation. This study addresses this gap by validating previous gender bias detectors using a manually labeled dataset and comparing how the bias identified by various detectors deviates from the actual bias in T2I models, as verified by manual confirmation. We create a dataset consisting of 6,000 images generated from three cutting-edge T2I models: Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, and Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0. During the human-labeling process, we find that all three T2I models generate a portion (12.48% on average) of low-quality images (e.g., generate images with no face present), where human annotators cannot determine the gender of the person. Our analysis reveals that all three T2I models show a preference for generating male images, with SDXL being the most biased. Additionally, images generated using prompts containing professional descriptions (e.g., lawyer or doctor) show the most bias. We evaluate seven gender bias detectors and find that none fully capture the actual level of bias in T2I models, with some detectors overestimating bias by up to 26.95%. We further investigate the causes of inaccurate estimations, highlighting the limitations of detectors in dealing with low-quality images. Based on our findings, we propose an enhanced detector...</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |

However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 12 figures | None |

Generative models have been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment. Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and texture.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures | None |

Videos and images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while requiring fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: deepfake, facial recognition, feature extraction, artificial intelligence, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network, artificial neural network</p></details> | None |

While recent advances in multi-modal encoders have enabled progress in cross-modal generation, ambiguity stemming from homographs and auditory illusions continues to hinder accurate alignment. To address this issue, CatchPhrase generates enriched cross-modal semantic prompts (EXPrompt Mining) from weak class labels by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and audio captioning models (ACMs). To address both class-level and instance-level misalignment, we apply multi-modal filtering and retrieval to select the most semantically aligned prompt for each audio sample (EXPrompt Selector). A lightweight mapping network is then trained to adapt pre-trained text-to-image generation models to audio input. Extensive experiments on multiple audio classification datasets demonstrate that CatchPhrase improves audio-to-image alignment and consistently enhances generation quality by mitigating semantic misalignment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks.

These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

This approach uses attention to connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens, enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the self-attention module in class-conditional image generation.

As an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality, effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of global agriculture.</p></details> |  | None |

TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks.

Despite its practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original model.

State-of-the-art methods alleviate such overhead in parallel diffusion inference through computation-communication overlapping, termed displaced parallelism. However, we identify that these techniques induce severe *staleness*-the usage of outdated activations from previous timesteps that significantly degrades quality, especially in expert-parallel scenarios. We tackle this fundamental tension and propose DICE, a staleness-centric optimization framework with a three-fold approach: (1) Interweaved Parallelism introduces staggered pipelines, effectively halving step-level staleness for free; (2) Selective Synchronization operates at layer-level and protects layers vulnerable from staled activations; and (3) Conditional Communication, a token-level, training-free method that dynamically adjusts communication frequency based on token importance. Together, these strategies effectively reduce staleness, achieving 1.26x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Empirical results establish DICE as an effective and scalable solution.

Although both GNet and HNet are encapsulated in a black box (called operation network, or ONet), with only the generated and marked outputs from HNet being released to end users and deemed secure, in this paper, we reveal an overlooked vulnerability in such systems. Specifically, we show that the hidden GNet outputs can still be reliably estimated via query-based reverse engineering, leaking the generated and unmarked images, despite the attacker's limited knowledge of the system. Our first attempt is to reverse-engineer an inverse model for HNet under the stringent black-box condition, for which we propose to exploit the query process with specially curated input images. While effective, this method yields unsatisfactory image quality. To improve this, we subsequently propose an alternative method leveraging the equivalent additive property of box-free model watermarking and reverse-engineering a forward surrogate model of HNet, with better image quality preservation. Extensive experimental results on image processing and image generation tasks demonstrate that both attacks achieve impressive watermark removal success rates (100%) while also maintaining excellent image quality (reaching the highest PSNR of 34.69 dB), substantially outperforming existing attacks, highlighting the urgent need for robust defensive strategies to mitigate the identified vulnerability in box-free model watermarking.</p></details> |  | None |

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |

As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved 100% attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than cent percent accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of coding theory.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively. Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG) demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation model for unified multimodal generation.

Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention, propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools, we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yoterel.github.io/attention_chains/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yoterel.github.io/attention_chains) |

Let's Verify and Reinforce Image Generation Step by Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13926v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image, which is the first to incorporate reflection in autoregressive image generation. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation.

Despite the remarkable progress, state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches. Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Context Diffusion: In-Context Aware Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03584v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Context Diffusion, a diffusion-based framework that enables image generation models to learn from visual examples presented in context. Recent work tackles such in-context learning for image generation, where a query image is provided alongside context examples and text prompts. However, the quality and context fidelity of the generated images deteriorate when the prompt is not present, demonstrating that these models cannot truly learn from the visual context. To address this, we propose a novel framework that separates the encoding of the visual context and the preservation of the desired image layout. This results in the ability to learn from the visual context and prompts, but also from either of them. Furthermore, we enable our model to handle few-shot settings, to effectively address diverse in-context learning scenarios. Our experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that Context Diffusion excels in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, resulting in an overall enhancement in image quality and context fidelity compared to counterpart models.</p></details> |  | None |

This concerning issue has renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD (h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, highlighting their effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 15 figures.

In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting anomalies while reducing false positive rates.</p></details> |  | None |

However, prior efforts in this field have either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation.

Each human part, such as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions. In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module (PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction.

| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results.

| **[Gungnir: Exploiting Stylistic Features in Images for Backdoor Attacks on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20650v4)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR).

To address this challenge, we introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach, each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with black-box T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025, MARS2 Workshop.

| **[Fine-Grained Alignment and Noise Refinement for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06506v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generative models have made significant advancements in recent years; however, accurately capturing intricate details in textual prompts-such as entity missing, attribute binding errors, and incorrect relationships remains a formidable challenge. In response, we present an innovative, training-free method that directly addresses these challenges by incorporating tailored objectives to account for textual constraints. Unlike layout-based approaches that enforce rigid structures and limit diversity, our proposed approach offers a more flexible arrangement of the scene by imposing just the extracted constraints from the text, without any unnecessary additions. These constraints are formulated as losses-entity missing, entity mixing, attribute binding, and spatial relationships-integrated into a unified loss that is applied in the first generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback-driven system for fine-grained initial noise refinement. This system integrates a verifier that evaluates the generated image, identifies inconsistencies, and provides corrective feedback. Leveraging this feedback, our refinement method first targets the unmet constraints by refining the faulty attention maps caused by initial noise, through the optimization of selective losses associated with these constraints. Subsequently, our unified loss function is reapplied to proceed the second generation phase. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, relying solely on our proposed objective functions, significantly enhances compositionality, achieving a 24% improvement in human evaluation and a 25% gain in spatial relationships. Furthermore, our fine-grained noise refinement proves effective, boosting performance by up to 5%.

However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.</p></details> |  | None |

The semantics, context, and structure of an image can evoke emotional responses, making emotional image editing techniques valuable for various real-world applications, including treatment of psychological disorders, commercialization of products, and artistic design. First, we present a novel challenge of emotion-evoked image generation, aiming to synthesize images that evoke target emotions while retaining the semantics and structures of the original scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model capable of effectively understanding and editing source images to convey desired emotions and sentiments. Moreover, due to the lack of emotion editing datasets, we provide a unique dataset consisting of 340,000 pairs of images and their emotion annotations. Furthermore, we conduct human psychophysics experiments and introduce a new evaluation metric to systematically benchmark all the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses all competitive baselines. Our diffusion model is capable of identifying emotional cues from original images, editing images that elicit desired emotions, and meanwhile, preserving the semantic structure of the original images.

This raises serious concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs from the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential external safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before real-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system. Unlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple and tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient optimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9 state-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I models and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction.

| **[A Human-Centered Approach to Identifying Promises, Risks, & Challenges of Text-to-Image Generative AI in Radiology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16207v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As text-to-image generative models rapidly improve, AI researchers are making significant advances in developing domain-specific models capable of generating complex medical imagery from text prompts. Despite this, these technical advancements have overlooked whether and how medical professionals would benefit from and use text-to-image generative AI (GenAI) in practice. By developing domain-specific GenAI without involving stakeholders, we risk the potential of building models that are either not useful or even more harmful than helpful. In this paper, we adopt a human-centered approach to responsible model development by involving stakeholders in evaluating and reflecting on the promises, risks, and challenges of a novel text-to-CT Scan GenAI model. Through exploratory model prompting activities, we uncover the perspectives of medical students, radiology trainees, and radiologists on the role that text-to-CT Scan GenAI can play across medical education, training, and practice. This human-centered approach additionally enabled us to surface technical challenges and domain-specific risks of generating synthetic medical images. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of medical text-to-image GenAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, accepted to AAAI/ACM AIES 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LSSGen: Leveraging Latent Space Scaling in Flow and Diffusion for Efficient Text to Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16154v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches. When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\% TOPIQ score improvement.</p></details> | ICCV AIGENS 2025 | None |

Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they are generally limited to single-ID scenarios and offer insufficient facial editability. We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the base model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which applies feature-space manipulation to effectively disentangle and reconfigure facial motion and identity features, supporting flexible facial editing. 3) a task-decoupled training paradigm that reduces data dependency, together with VariFace-10k, a curated dataset of 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability.

| **[Improving Personalized Image Generation through Social Context Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16095v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose, human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Generative Model for Disentangling Galaxy Photometric Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15898v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ongoing and future photometric surveys will produce unprecedented volumes of galaxy images, necessitating robust, efficient methods for deriving galaxy morphological parameters at scale. Traditional approaches, such as parametric light-profile fitting, offer valuable insights but become computationally prohibitive when applied to billions of sources. In this work, we propose a Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework to simultaneously model and characterize galaxy morphology. Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock galaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types, photometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index, ellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into a low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our model effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled manner, while also reconstructing the original image. The results demonstrate that the CAE approach can accurately and efficiently infer complex structural properties, offering a powerful alternative to existing methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[ReDi: Rectified Discrete Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15897v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs, which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically, ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge, providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis.

| **[A Practical Investigation of Spatially-Controlled Image Generation with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15724v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | preprint | None |

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CylinderPlane: Nested Cylinder Representation for 3D-aware Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15606v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis. We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation achieves superior performance over previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, to be published</p></details> | None |
| **[Visually Guided Decoding: Gradient-Free Hard Prompt Inversion with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08622v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generative models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have revolutionized visual content creation across various applications, including advertising, personalized media, and design prototyping. However, crafting effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts, VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Official Code: https://github.com/DonghoonKim-1938/VGD)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/DonghoonKim-1938/VGD) |
| **[Improving Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with Diffusion Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15216v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending generative models. However, generative models perform better in image generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes will be released soon in public.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to their subtlety and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored, high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models, rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our GitHub repository.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their growing popularity has raised ethical and social concerns related to key non-functional properties of trustworthiness, such as robustness, fairness, security, privacy, factuality, and explainability, similar to those in traditional deep learning (DL) tasks. Conventional approaches for studying trustworthiness in DL tasks often fall short due to the unique characteristics of T2I DMs, e.g., the multi-modal nature. Given the challenge, recent efforts have been made to develop new methods for investigating trustworthiness in T2I DMs via various means, including falsification, enhancement, verification \& validation and assessment. However, there is a notable lack of in-depth analysis concerning those non-functional properties and means. In this survey, we provide a timely and focused review of the literature on trustworthy T2I DMs, covering a concise-structured taxonomy from the perspectives of property, means, benchmarks and applications. Our review begins with an introduction to essential preliminaries of T2I DMs, and then we summarise key definitions/metrics specific to T2I tasks and analyses the means proposed in recent literature based on these definitions/metrics. Additionally, we review benchmarks and domain applications of T2I DMs. Finally, we highlight the gaps in current research, discuss the limitations of existing methods, and propose future research directions to advance the development of trustworthy T2I DMs. Furthermore, we keep up-to-date updates in this field to track the latest developments and maintain our GitHub repository at: https://github.com/wellzline/Trustworthy_T2I_DMs</p></details> | under review | [Code Link](https://github.com/wellzline/Trustworthy_T2I_DMs) |

While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for identity-preserving applications.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?" The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing methods have advanced the field, their reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT, the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images, built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text. Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

However, existing E2E-AD systems typically adopt a traditional multi-task framework, addressing perception, prediction, and planning tasks through separate task-specific heads. Despite being trained in a fully differentiable manner, they still encounter issues with task coordination, and the system complexity remains high. In this work, we introduce DiffAD, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that redefines autonomous driving as a conditional image generation task. By rasterizing heterogeneous targets onto a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) and modeling their latent distribution, DiffAD unifies various driving objectives and jointly optimizes all driving tasks in a single framework, significantly reducing system complexity and harmonizing task coordination. The reverse process iteratively refines the generated BEV image, resulting in more robust and realistic driving behaviors.

A critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language: poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings. Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced information capture in the generated images.</p></details> | ECAI 2025 | None |

However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Text-to-Image generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text. TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility.

Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical solution for personalized virtual fashion display.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with \textbf{9$\boldsymbol\times$} fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper evaluates the impact of augmentation strategies on two personalization methods: DreamBooth and InstantID. We compare classical augmentations (flipping, cropping, color adjustments) with generative augmentation using InstantID's synthetic images to enrich training data. Using SDXL and a new FaceDistance metric based on FaceNet, we quantitatively assess facial similarity. Results show classical augmentations can cause artifacts harming identity retention, while InstantID improves fidelity when balanced with real images to avoid overfitting. A user study with 97 participants confirms high photorealism and preferences for InstantID's polished look versus DreamBooth's identity accuracy.

In previous editions of the BraTS Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81 s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting.

However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256 steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with 775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable real-time speech-to-image conversion.

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several benchmarks.

| **[DMQ: Dissecting Outliers of Diffusion Models for Post-Training Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12933v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

Unlike existing methods that rely on reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process, without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data, while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huanngzh.github.io/MIDI-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://huanngzh.github.io/MIDI-Page) |
| **[Local Representative Token Guided Merging for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12771v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image, but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time. We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |

Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification, showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation, particularly in low-data regimes.

Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion (MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose, in-context generative diffusion architectures.</p></details> | 26 pages | None |

This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission, 22 pages, 7 tables, 12 figures</p></details> | None |

We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity, explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality. Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by 5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance. Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.</p></details> | Camera Ready | None |

As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

While extensive research exists, most efforts either focus on specific tasks, i.e., anomalies or normal products only, or require separate models for each anomaly type. Consequently, prior methods either offer limited generative capability or depend on a vast array of anomaly-specific models. We demonstrate that U-Net's differentiated learning ability captures the distinct visual traits of slightly-varied normal products and diverse anomalies, enabling us to construct a unified model for all tasks. Specifically, we first introduce an Unbalanced Abnormal (UA) Text Prompt, comprising one normal token and multiple anomaly tokens. More importantly, our Decoupled Anomaly Alignment (DA) loss decouples anomaly attributes and binds them to distinct anomaly tokens of UA, enabling SeaS to create unseen anomalies by recombining these attributes. Furthermore, our Normal-image Alignment (NA) loss aligns the normal token to normal patterns, making generated normal products globally consistent and locally varied. Finally, SeaS produces accurate anomaly masks by fusing discriminative U-Net features with high-resolution VAE features. SeaS sets a new benchmark for industrial generation, significantly enhancing downstream applications, with average improvements of $+8.66\%$ pixel-level AP for synthesis-based AD approaches, $+1.10\%$ image-level AP for unsupervised AD methods, and $+12.79\%$ IoU for supervised segmentation models.

However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential practical applications in the environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages, 4 figures.

Despite its potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each instance within the multi-instance image.</p></details> | 6 Pages | None |
| **[Schrödinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11925v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schr\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient.

However, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in complex scenes due to distortions in non-personalized regions and the need for additional fine-tuning, limiting their practicality. To address this issue, we propose FlipConcept, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates multiple personalized concepts into a single image without requiring additional tuning. We introduce guided appearance attention to enhance the visual fidelity of personalized concepts. Additionally, we introduce mask-guided noise mixing to protect non-personalized regions during concept integration. Lastly, we apply background dilution to minimize concept leakage, i.e., the undesired blending of personalized concepts with other objects in the image. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method, despite not requiring tuning, outperforms existing models in both single and multiple personalized concept inference. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach for scalable, high-quality multi-concept personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE SMC 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[PerLDiff: Controllable Street View Synthesis Using Perspective-Layout Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06109v5)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable generation is considered a potentially vital approach to address the challenge of annotating 3D data, and the precision of such controllable generation becomes particularly imperative in the context of data production for autonomous driving. Existing methods focus on the integration of diverse generative information into controlling inputs, utilizing frameworks such as GLIGEN or ControlNet, to produce commendable outcomes in controllable generation. However, such approaches intrinsically restrict generation performance to the learning capacities of predefined network architectures. In this paper, we explore the innovative integration of controlling information and introduce PerLDiff (\textbf{Per}spective-\textbf{L}ayout \textbf{Diff}usion Models), a novel method for effective street view image generation that fully leverages perspective 3D geometric information. Our PerLDiff employs 3D geometric priors to guide the generation of street view images with precise object-level control within the network learning process, resulting in a more robust and controllable output. Moreover, it demonstrates superior controllability compared to alternative layout control methods. Empirical results justify that our PerLDiff markedly enhances the precision of controllable generation on the NuScenes and KITTI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Although quantization paves a way for model compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details, which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist, which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs, broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios.

However, decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel 5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking, (4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.

Similarly, differentially private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies.

However, the scarcity of smoke image data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations, particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection models.

However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is available at https://imagineforme.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Currently, the use of AI chatbots by consumers has largely been limited to image generation or question-answering language models. The next generation of AI systems, AI agents that can plan and execute complex tasks with only limited human involvement, will be capable of a much broader range of actions. In particular, consumers could soon be able to delegate purchasing decisions to AI agents acting as Custobots. Against this background, the Article explores whether EU consumer law, as it currently stands, is ready for the rise of the Custobot Economy. In doing so, the Article makes three contributions. First, it outlines how the advent of AI agents could change the existing e-commerce landscape. Second, it explains how AI agents challenge the premises of a human-centric consumer law which is based on the assumption that consumption decisions are made by humans. Third, the Article presents some initial considerations how a future consumer law could look like that works for both humans and machines.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

| **[Text Embedding Knows How to Quantize Text-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10340v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity, clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and identity-preserving full-body synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures | None |

We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs).

However, these approaches neglect the causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lacks scalability, and/or compromises generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style) -- all during test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than the current state-of-the-art.

The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (\textbf{MV-AR}) method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the ``Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading diffusion-based multi-view image generation models.

While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task.

CT scans are the key imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework, particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.</p></details> | 5 figures | None |

Existing methods typically treat them separately, struggling with limited high-quality data and poor generalization. However, both tasks require capturing complex visual variations while maintaining consistency between inputs and outputs. Inspired by this, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that standardizes task representations using multimodal instructions. It first treats subject-driven generation as creation on a blank canvas and instruction-based editing as modification of an existing image, establishing a shared input-output formulation, then introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps free-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space, integrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism. This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: by leveraging shared visual and semantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and visual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing. (2) Generalization: learning in a unified format facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel compositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing. Experiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing while setting a SOTA in the new task of instruction-based subject-driven editing.

To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following.
