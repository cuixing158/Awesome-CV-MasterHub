| **[ReasonGen-R1: CoT for Autoregressive Image generation models through SFT and RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24875v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven breakthroughs in NLP, their integration into generative vision models remains underexplored. We introduce ReasonGen-R1, a two-stage framework that first imbues an autoregressive image generator with explicit text-based "thinking" skills via supervised fine-tuning on a newly generated reasoning dataset of written rationales, and then refines its outputs using Group Relative Policy Optimization. To enable the model to reason through text before generating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model crafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of object layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines and prior state-of-the-art models.

| **[GenSpace: Benchmarking Spatially-Aware Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24870v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar 3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Draw ALL Your Imagine: A Holistic Benchmark and Agent Framework for Complex Instruction-based Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24787v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have enabled models to produce high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models often struggle with complex instructions involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships. Existing benchmarks for evaluating T2I models primarily focus on general text-image alignment and fail to capture the nuanced requirements of complex, multi-faceted prompts. Given this gap, we introduce LongBench-T2I, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models under complex instructions. LongBench-T2I consists of 500 intricately designed prompts spanning nine diverse visual evaluation dimensions, enabling a thorough assessment of a model's ability to follow complex instructions. Beyond benchmarking, we propose an agent framework (Plan2Gen) that facilitates complex instruction-driven image generation without requiring additional model training. This framework integrates seamlessly with existing T2I models, using large language models to interpret and decompose complex prompts, thereby guiding the generation process more effectively. As existing evaluation metrics, such as CLIPScore, fail to adequately capture the nuances of complex instructions, we introduce an evaluation toolkit that automates the quality assessment of generated images using a set of multi-dimensional metrics.

In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of more than +8 in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 83% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshops (AI4CC (oral) & GMCV (poster))</p></details> | None |
| **[DiffusionTrend: A Minimalist Approach to Virtual Fashion Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14465v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DiffusionTrend for virtual fashion try-on, which forgoes the need for retraining diffusion models. Using advanced diffusion models, DiffusionTrend harnesses latent information rich in prior information to capture the nuances of garment details. Throughout the diffusion denoising process, these details are seamlessly integrated into the model image generation, expertly directed by a precise garment mask crafted by a lightweight and compact CNN. Although our DiffusionTrend model initially demonstrates suboptimal metric performance, our exploratory approach offers some important advantages: (1) It circumvents resource-intensive retraining of diffusion models on large datasets. (2) It eliminates the necessity for various complex and user-unfriendly model inputs. (3) It delivers a visually compelling try-on experience, underscoring the potential of training-free diffusion model. This initial foray into the application of untrained diffusion models in virtual try-on technology potentially paves the way for further exploration and refinement in this industrially and academically valuable field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DCTdiff: Intriguing Properties of Image Generative Modeling in the DCT Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15032v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores image modeling from the frequency space and introduces DCTdiff, an end-to-end diffusion generative paradigm that efficiently models images in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) space. We investigate the design space of DCTdiff and reveal the key design factors. Experiments on different frameworks (UViT, DiT), generation tasks, and various diffusion samplers demonstrate that DCTdiff outperforms pixel-based diffusion models regarding generative quality and training efficiency. Remarkably, DCTdiff can seamlessly scale up to 512$\times$512 resolution without using the latent diffusion paradigm and beats latent diffusion (using SD-VAE) with only 1/4 training cost. Finally, we illustrate several intriguing properties of DCT image modeling. For example, we provide a theoretical proof of why 'image diffusion can be seen as spectral autoregression', bridging the gap between diffusion and autoregressive models. The effectiveness of DCTdiff and the introduced properties suggest a promising direction for image modeling in the frequency space.

| **[AnimeGamer: Infinite Anime Life Simulation with Next Game State Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01014v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image and video synthesis have opened up new promise in generative games. One particularly intriguing application is transforming characters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows players to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite characters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are defined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and fixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through open-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments. Recently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs large language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into language instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical visual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only generates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an engaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state, including dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates to character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel action-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can be decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By taking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting subsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual consistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both automated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms existing methods in various aspects of the gaming experience.

| **[Flow-of-Options: Diversified and Improved LLM Reasoning by Thinking Through Options](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12929v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel reasoning approach called Flow-of-Options (FoO), designed to address intrinsic biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). Flow-of-Options enables LLMs to systematically explore a diverse range of possibilities in their reasoning, as demonstrated by an FoO-based agentic framework developed for autonomously solving Machine Learning (ML) tasks. FoO enforces diversity in LLM solutions through compressed and interpretable task representations, resulting in improvements of 38.2% - 69.2% on standard data science tasks, and 37.4% - 47.9% on therapeutic chemistry tasks, as compared to state-of-the-art baselines. With an overall operation cost under $1 per task, our framework is well-suited for cost-sensitive applications. Going beyond tabular classification and regression, we show the broader applicability of our FoO-based agentic system to tasks such as reinforcement learning and image generation. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/flagshippioneering/Flow-of-Options.</p></details> | ICML 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/flagshippioneering/Flow-of-Options) |
| **[AutoStudio: Crafting Consistent Subjects in Multi-turn Interactive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01388v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cutting-edge Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models already excel at producing remarkable single images, an even more challenging task, i.e., multi-turn interactive image generation begins to attract the attention of related research communities. This task requires models to interact with users over multiple turns to generate a coherent sequence of images. However, since users may switch subjects frequently, current efforts struggle to maintain subject consistency while generating diverse images. To address this issue, we introduce a training-free multi-agent framework called AutoStudio. AutoStudio employs three agents based on large language models (LLMs) to handle interactions, along with a stable diffusion (SD) based agent for generating high-quality images. Specifically, AutoStudio consists of (i) a subject manager to interpret interaction dialogues and manage the context of each subject, (ii) a layout generator to generate fine-grained bounding boxes to control subject locations, (iii) a supervisor to provide suggestions for layout refinements, and (iv) a drawer to complete image generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Parallel-UNet to replace the original UNet in the drawer, which employs two parallel cross-attention modules for exploiting subject-aware features. We also introduce a subject-initialized generation method to better preserve small subjects. Our AutoStudio hereby can generate a sequence of multi-subject images interactively and consistently. Extensive experiments on the public CMIGBench benchmark and human evaluations show that AutoStudio maintains multi-subject consistency across multiple turns well, and it also raises the state-of-the-art performance by 13.65% in average Frechet Inception Distance and 2.83% in average character-character similarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Multi...</summary><p>Multi-turn interactive image generation</p></details> | None |
| **[TheaterGen: Character Management with LLM for Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18919v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text. However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns. To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation. Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal". Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance". With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images. Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions. Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance. Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly. It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GPT4Point: A Unified Framework for Point-Language Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02980v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have excelled in 2D image-text comprehension and image generation, but their understanding of the 3D world is notably deficient, limiting progress in 3D language understanding and generation. To solve this problem, we introduce GPT4Point, an innovative groundbreaking point-language multimodal model designed specifically for unified 3D object understanding and generation within the MLLM framework. GPT4Point as a powerful 3D MLLM seamlessly can execute a variety of point-text reference tasks such as point-cloud captioning and Q&A. Additionally, GPT4Point is equipped with advanced capabilities for controllable 3D generation, it can get high-quality results through a low-quality point-text feature maintaining the geometric shapes and colors. To support the expansive needs of 3D object-text pairs, we develop Pyramid-XL, a point-language dataset annotation engine. It constructs a large-scale database over 1M objects of varied text granularity levels from the Objaverse-XL dataset, essential for training GPT4Point. A comprehensive benchmark has been proposed to evaluate 3D point-language understanding capabilities. In extensive evaluations, GPT4Point has demonstrated superior performance in understanding and generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[un$^2$CLIP: Improving CLIP's Visual Detail Capturing Ability via Inverting unCLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24517v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a foundation model and has been applied to various vision and multimodal tasks. However, recent works indicate that CLIP falls short in distinguishing detailed differences in images and shows suboptimal performance on dense-prediction and vision-centric multimodal tasks. Therefore, this work focuses on improving existing CLIP models, aiming to capture as many visual details in images as possible. We find that a specific type of generative models, unCLIP, provides a suitable framework for achieving our goal. Specifically, unCLIP trains an image generator conditioned on the CLIP image embedding. In other words, it inverts the CLIP image encoder. Compared to discriminative models like CLIP, generative models are better at capturing image details because they are trained to learn the data distribution of images. Additionally, the conditional input space of unCLIP aligns with CLIP's original image-text embedding space. Therefore, we propose to invert unCLIP (dubbed un$^2$CLIP) to improve the CLIP model. In this way, the improved image encoder can gain unCLIP's visual detail capturing ability while preserving its alignment with the original text encoder simultaneously. We evaluate our improved CLIP across various tasks to which CLIP has been applied, including the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark, the dense-prediction open-vocabulary segmentation task, and multimodal large language model tasks. Experiments show that un$^2$CLIP significantly improves the original CLIP and previous CLIP improvement methods.

| **[CAE-Net: Generalized Deepfake Image Detection using Convolution and Attention Mechanisms with Spatial and Frequency Domain Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10682v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective deepfake detection tools are becoming increasingly essential to the growing usage of deepfakes in unethical practices. There exists a wide range of deepfake generation techniques, which makes it challenging to develop an accurate universal detection mechanism. The 2025 IEEE Signal Processing Cup (\textit{DFWild-Cup} competition) provided a diverse dataset of deepfake images containing significant class imbalance. The images in the dataset are generated from multiple deepfake image generators, for training machine learning model(s) to emphasize the generalization of deepfake detection. To this end, we proposed a disjoint set-based multistage training method to address the class imbalance and devised an ensemble-based architecture \emph{CAE-Net}. Our architecture consists of a convolution- and attention-based ensemble network, and employs three different neural network architectures: EfficientNet, Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and ConvNeXt with wavelet transform to capture both local and global features of deepfakes. We visualize the specific regions that these models focus on for classification using Grad-CAM, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in grouping real and fake images into cohesive clusters using t-SNE plots. Individually, the EfficientNet B0 architecture has achieved 90.79\% accuracy, whereas the ConvNeXt and the DeiT architecture have achieved 89.49\% and 89.32\% accuracy, respectively. With these networks, our weighted ensemble model achieves an excellent accuracy of 94.63\% on the validation dataset of the SP Cup 2025 competition. The equal error rate of 4.72\% and the Area Under the ROC curve of 97.37\% further confirm the stability of our proposed method. Finally, the robustness of our proposed model against adversarial perturbation attacks is tested as well, showing the inherent defensive properties of the ensemble approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in Elsevier Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation</p></details> | None |

Existing flow matching networks typically predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

They have been applied successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline. We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable interpretability to SAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Mechanistic Interpretability for Vision at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Category-aware EEG image generation based on wavelet transform and contrast semantic loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24301v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing visual stimuli from EEG signals is a crucial step in realizing brain-computer interfaces. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based EEG signal encoder integrating the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the gating mechanism. Guided by the feature alignment and category-aware fusion losses, this encoder is used to extract features related to visual stimuli from EEG signals. Subsequently, with the aid of a pre-trained diffusion model, these features are reconstructed into visual stimuli. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we conducted EEG-to-image generation and classification tasks using the THINGS-EEG dataset. To address the limitations of quantitative analysis at the semantic level, we combined WordNet-based classification and semantic similarity metrics to propose a novel semantic-based score, emphasizing the ability of our model to transfer neural activities into visual representations. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves semantic alignment and classification accuracy, which achieves a maximum single-subject accuracy of 43\%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Current DM sampling techniques typically rely on first-order Langevin dynamics at each noise level, with efforts concentrated on refining inter-level denoising strategies. While leveraging additional second-order Hessian geometry to enhance the sampling quality of Langevin is a common practice in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the naive attempts to utilize Hessian geometry in high-dimensional DMs lead to quadratic-complexity computational costs, rendering them non-scalable. In this work, we introduce a novel Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML) method that approximates the diffusion Hessian geometry in a training-free manner, drawing inspiration from the celebrated Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) A low-rank approximation of the diffusion Hessian, leveraging the DMs' inherent structure and circumventing explicit quadratic-complexity computations; (2) A damping mechanism to stabilize the approximated Hessian. This LML approximated Hessian geometry enables the diffusion sampling to execute more accurate steps and improve the image generation quality. We further conduct a theoretical analysis to substantiate the approximation error bound of low-rank approximation and the convergence property of the damping mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple pretrained DMs validate that the LML method significantly improves image generation quality, with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

Although prior layout-based methods improve object arrangements using spatial constraints with 2D layouts, they often struggle to capture 3D positioning and sacrifice quality and coherence. In this work, we introduce ComposeAnything, a novel framework for improving compositional image generation without retraining existing T2I models. Our approach first leverages the chain-of-thought reasoning abilities of LLMs to produce 2.5D semantic layouts from text, consisting of 2D object bounding boxes enriched with depth information and detailed captions. Based on this layout, we generate a spatial and depth aware coarse composite of objects that captures the intended composition, serving as a strong and interpretable prior that replaces stochastic noise initialization in diffusion-based T2I models. This prior guides the denoising process through object prior reinforcement and spatial-controlled denoising, enabling seamless generation of compositional objects and coherent backgrounds, while allowing refinement of inaccurate priors. ComposeAnything outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the T2I-CompBench and NSR-1K benchmarks for prompts with 2D/3D spatial arrangements, high object counts, and surreal compositions. Human evaluations further demonstrate that our model generates high-quality images with compositions that faithfully reflect the text.</p></details> |  | None |

As these models proliferate, they expose new concerns about their ability to represent diverse demographic groups, propagate stereotypes, and efface minority populations. Despite growing attention to the "safe" and "responsible" design of artificial intelligence (AI), there is no established methodology to systematically measure and control representational harms in image generation. This paper introduces a novel framework to measure the representation of intersectional groups in images generated by T2I models by applying the Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR) metric. MPR evaluates the worst-case deviation of representation statistics across given population groups in images produced by a generative model, allowing for flexible and context-specific measurements based on user requirements. We also develop an algorithm to optimize T2I models for this metric. Through experiments, we demonstrate that MPR can effectively measure representation statistics across multiple intersectional groups and, when used as a training objective, can guide models toward a more balanced generation across demographic groups while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative iteration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://lorashop.github.io/</p></details> | None |

In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models.

Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture.

While recent T2I models have made impressive progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense, mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

With the introduction of classifier-free guidance (CFG), the quality of images generated by DMs is significantly improved. However, one can use DMs to generate more harmful images by maliciously guiding the image generation process through CFG. Existing safe alignment methods aim to mitigate the risk of generating harmful images but often reduce the quality of clean image generation. To address this issue, we propose SafeCFG to adaptively control harmful features with dynamic safe guidance by modulating the CFG generation process. It dynamically guides the CFG generation process based on the harmfulness of the prompts, inducing significant deviations only in harmful CFG generations, achieving high quality and safety generation. SafeCFG can simultaneously modulate different harmful CFG generation processes, so it could eliminate harmful elements while preserving high-quality generation. Additionally, SafeCFG provides the ability to detect image harmfulness, allowing unsupervised safe alignment on DMs without pre-defined clean or harmful labels. Experimental results show that images generated by SafeCFG achieve both high quality and safety, and safe DMs trained in our unsupervised manner also exhibit good safety performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Diffusion Sampling Path Tells More: An Efficient Plug-and-Play Strategy for Sample Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23343v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models often exhibit inconsistent sample quality due to stochastic variations inherent in their sampling trajectories. Although training-based fine-tuning (e.g. DDPO [1]) and inference-time alignment techniques[2] aim to improve sample fidelity, they typically necessitate full denoising processes and external reward signals. This incurs substantial computational costs, hindering their broader applicability. In this work, we unveil an intriguing phenomenon: a previously unobserved yet exploitable link between sample quality and characteristics of the denoising trajectory during classifier-free guidance (CFG). Specifically, we identify a strong correlation between high-density regions of the sample distribution and the Accumulated Score Differences (ASD)--the cumulative divergence between conditional and unconditional scores. Leveraging this insight, we introduce CFG-Rejection, an efficient, plug-and-play strategy that filters low-quality samples at an early stage of the denoising process, crucially without requiring external reward signals or model retraining. Importantly, our approach necessitates no modifications to model architectures or sampling schedules and maintains full compatibility with existing diffusion frameworks. We validate the effectiveness of CFG-Rejection in image generation through extensive experiments, demonstrating marked improvements on human preference scores (HPSv2, PickScore) and challenging benchmarks (GenEval, DPG-Bench). We anticipate that CFG-Rejection will offer significant advantages for diverse generative modalities beyond images, paving the way for more efficient and reliable high-quality sample generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Video Generative Models are Experts on Controllable Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23325v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models can be regarded as world simulators due to their ability to capture dynamic, continuous changes inherent in real-world environments. These models integrate high-dimensional information across visual, temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions, enabling predictions of subjects in various status. A natural and valuable research direction is to explore whether a fully trained video generative model in high-dimensional space can effectively support lower-dimensional tasks such as controllable image generation. In this work, we propose a paradigm for video-to-image knowledge compression and task adaptation, termed \textit{Dimension-Reduction Attack} (\texttt{DRA-Ctrl}), which utilizes the strengths of video models, including long-range context modeling and flatten full-attention, to perform various generation tasks. Specially, to address the challenging gap between continuous video frames and discrete image generation, we introduce a mixup-based transition strategy that ensures smooth adaptation. Moreover, we redesign the attention structure with a tailored masking mechanism to better align text prompts with image-level control. Experiments across diverse image generation tasks, such as subject-driven and spatially conditioned generation, show that repurposed video models outperform those trained directly on images. These results highlight the untapped potential of large-scale video generators for broader visual applications. \texttt{DRA-Ctrl} provides new insights into reusing resource-intensive video models and lays foundation for future unified generative models across visual modalities.

Despite its broad downstream applicability - ranging from enhanced personalization in image generation to consistent character representation in video rendering - progress in this field is limited by the lack of reliable automatic evaluation. Existing methods either assess only one aspect of the task (i.e., textual alignment or subject preservation), misalign with human judgments, or rely on costly API-based evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce RefVNLI, a cost-effective metric that evaluates both textual alignment and subject preservation in a single run. Trained on a large-scale dataset derived from video-reasoning benchmarks and image perturbations, RefVNLI outperforms or statistically matches existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and subject categories (e.g., \emph{Animal}, \emph{Object}), achieving up to 6.4-point gains in textual alignment and 5.9-point gains in subject preservation.</p></details> |  | None |

While diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for image generation, their impact on remote sensing forgery detection remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks primarily target GAN-based forgeries or focus on natural images, limiting progress in this critical domain. To address this gap, we introduce RSFAKE-1M, a large-scale dataset of 500K forged and 500K real remote sensing images. The fake images are generated by ten diffusion models fine-tuned on remote sensing data, covering six generation conditions such as text prompts, structural guidance, and inpainting. This paper presents the construction of RSFAKE-1M along with a comprehensive experimental evaluation using both existing detectors and unified baselines. The results reveal that diffusion-based remote sensing forgeries remain challenging for current methods, and that models trained on RSFAKE-1M exhibit notably improved generalization and robustness. Our findings underscore the importance of RSFAKE-1M as a foundation for developing and evaluating next-generation forgery detection approaches in the remote sensing domain.

With the development of diffusion models (DM) and unified MLLMs, the performance of image generation has been significantly improved, however, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with MLLMs is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the week image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive medical image screening dataset with 1500+ samples, each sample consists of a medical image, four generated images, and a multiple-choice answer. The dataset evaluates the aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: \textit{(1) Appearance Deformation, (2) Principles of Physical Lighting and Shadow, (3) Placement Layout, (4) Extension Rationality}. For methodology, we utilize long chains of thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization with Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward, called DPA-GRPO, to enhance the image aesthetic reasoning ability of MLLMs. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the reinforcement learning approach, we are able to surpass the score of both large-scale models and leading closed-source models using a much smaller model. We hope our attempt on medical image screening will serve as a regular configuration in image aesthetic reasoning in the future.</p></details> |  | None |

Some approaches address this issue by fine-tuning models in terms of preference optimization, etc., which require tailored datasets. Orthogonal to these methods, we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages existing dataset as both positive and negative pairs. To enable efficient alignment with pretrained models, we propose SoftREPA- a lightweight contrastive fine-tuning strategy that leverages soft text tokens for representation alignment. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain sight.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research.

Specifically, we implement a simplified class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to produce label-consistent samples and explore their integration with real data via two hybrid training strategies: Mix Loss and Mix Representation. While these approaches yield promising validation performance, our proposed MixModel exhibits poor generalization to unseen test data, underscoring the challenges of leveraging synthetic data effectively. In contrast, baseline classifiers built on ResNet backbones with conventional loss functions demonstrate greater stability and test-time performance. Our findings highlight the importance of realistic data generation and robust supervision when incorporating generative augmentation into biomedical image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o, Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this critical trade-off, we introduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with 17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast. Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise, instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have open-sourced all the codes and model weights of HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, HiDream-I1-Fast, HiDream-E1 through our project websites: https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1 and https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-E1.

While recent voxel-based approaches can generate both geometric structures and semantic labels, existing range-view methods are limited to producing unlabeled LiDAR scenes. Relying on pretrained segmentation models to predict the semantic maps often results in suboptimal cross-modal consistency. To address this limitation while preserving the advantages of range-view representations, such as computational efficiency and simplified network design, we propose Spiral, a novel range-view LiDAR diffusion model that simultaneously generates depth, reflectance images, and semantic maps. Furthermore, we introduce novel semantic-aware metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated labeled range-view data. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Spiral achieves state-of-the-art performance with the smallest parameter size, outperforming two-step methods that combine the generative and segmentation models. Additionally, we validate that range images generated by Spiral can be effectively used for synthetic data augmentation in the downstream segmentation training, significantly reducing the labeling effort on LiDAR data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the theoretical principles underpinning this phenomenon remain elusive. This paper investigates this problem by examining the compositional generalization abilities of diffusion models in image generation. Our analysis reveals that while neural network architectures are expressive enough to represent a wide range of models -- including many with undesirable behavior on OOD inputs -- the true, generalizable model that aligns with human expectations typically corresponds to the simplest among those consistent with the training data. Motivated by this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for OOD generalization via simplicity, quantified using a predefined simplicity metric. We analyze two key regimes: (1) the constant-gap setting, where the true model is strictly simpler than all spurious alternatives by a fixed gap, and (2) the vanishing-gap setting, where the fixed gap is replaced by a smoothness condition ensuring that models close in simplicity to the true model yield similar predictions. For both regimes, we study the regularized maximum likelihood estimator and establish the first sharp sample complexity guarantees for learning the true, generalizable, simple model.</p></details> |  | None |

First, we introduce \textit{combined generation}, a novel sampling strategy that applies a reward-tuned diffusion model only in the later stages of the generation process, while preserving the base model for earlier steps. This approach mitigates early-stage overfitting and helps retain global structure and diversity. Second, we propose \textit{ImageReFL}, a fine-tuning method that improves image diversity with minimal loss in quality by training on real images and incorporating multiple regularizers, including diffusion and ReFL losses. Our approach outperforms conventional reward tuning methods on standard quality and diversity metrics.

In this paper, we address this fundamental challenge by: (i) releasing the first open, ultra-high-fidelity PrismLayers (PrismLayersPro) dataset of 200K (20K) multilayer transparent images with accurate alpha mattes, (ii) introducing a trainingfree synthesis pipeline that generates such data on demand using off-the-shelf diffusion models, and (iii) delivering a strong, open-source multi-layer generation model, ART+, which matches the aesthetics of modern text-to-image generation models. The key technical contributions include: LayerFLUX, which excels at generating high-quality single transparent layers with accurate alpha mattes, and MultiLayerFLUX, which composes multiple LayerFLUX outputs into complete images, guided by human-annotated semantic layout. To ensure higher quality, we apply a rigorous filtering stage to remove artifacts and semantic mismatches, followed by human selection. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art ART model on our synthetic PrismLayersPro yields ART+, which outperforms the original ART in 60% of head-to-head user study comparisons and even matches the visual quality of images generated by the FLUX.1-[dev] model.

While existing image generation networks can produce map-like outputs from remote sensing imagery, their emphasis on replicating texture rather than preserving geospatial features limits cartographic validity. Current approaches face two fundamental challenges: inadequate integration of cartographic generalization principles with dynamic multi-scale generation and spatial discontinuities arising from tile-wise generation. To address these limitations, we propose a scale-aware cartographic generation framework (SCGM) that leverages conditional guided diffusion and a multi-scale cascade architecture. The framework introduces three key innovations: a scale modality encoding mechanism to formalize map generalization relationships, a scale-driven conditional encoder for robust feature fusion, and a cascade reference mechanism ensuring cross-scale visual consistency. By hierarchically constraining large-scale map synthesis with small-scale structural priors, SCGM effectively mitigates edge artifacts while maintaining geographic fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on cartographic benchmarks confirm the framework's ability to generate seamless multi-scale tile maps with enhanced spatial coherence and generalization-aware representation, demonstrating significant potential for emergency mapping and automated cartography applications.</p></details> |  | None |

In such a model (\eg, a VAE, GAN, or continuous-time flow-based model), sampling of the target variable $\mathbf{x} \sim p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is straightforward, but sampling from a posterior distribution of the form $p(\mathbf{x}\mid\mathbf{y}) \propto p_\theta(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where $r$ is a constraint function depending on an auxiliary variable $\mathbf{y}$, is generally intractable. We propose to amortize the cost of sampling from such posterior distributions with diffusion models that sample a distribution in the noise space ($\mathbf{z}$). These diffusion samplers are trained by reinforcement learning algorithms to enforce that the transformed samples $f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$ are distributed according to the posterior in the data space ($\mathbf{x}$). For many models and constraints, the posterior in noise space is smoother than in data space, making it more suitable for amortized inference. Our method enables conditional sampling under unconditional GAN, (H)VAE, and flow-based priors, comparing favorably with other inference methods. We demonstrate the proposed outsourced diffusion sampling in several experiments with large pretrained prior models: conditional image generation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and protein structure generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025; code: https://github.com/HyperPotatoNeo/Outsourced_Diffusion_Sampling</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/HyperPotatoNeo/Outsourced_Diffusion_Sampling) |

However, existing image generation methods still significantly suffer from the dilemma of image reasoning, especially in logic-centered image generation tasks. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in LLMs, we propose SRRL, a self-reflective RL algorithm for diffusion models to achieve reasoning generation of logical images by performing reflection and iteration across generation trajectories. The intermediate samples in the denoising process carry noise, making accurate reward evaluation difficult. To address this challenge, SRRL treats the entire denoising trajectory as a CoT step with multi-round reflective denoising process and introduces condition guided forward process, which allows for reflective iteration between CoT steps. Through SRRL-based iterative diffusion training, we introduce image reasoning through CoT into generation tasks adhering to physical laws and unconventional physical phenomena for the first time.

| **[PacTure: Efficient PBR Texture Generation on Packed Views with Visual Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22394v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PacTure, a novel framework for generating physically-based rendering (PBR) material textures from an untextured 3D mesh, a text description, and an optional image prompt. Early 2D generation-based texturing approaches generate textures sequentially from different views, resulting in long inference times and globally inconsistent textures. More recent approaches adopt multi-view generation with cross-view attention to enhance global consistency, which, however, limits the resolution for each view. In response to these weaknesses, we first introduce view packing, a novel technique that significantly increases the effective resolution for each view during multi-view generation without imposing additional inference cost, by formulating the arrangement of multi-view maps as a 2D rectangle bin packing problem. In contrast to UV mapping, it preserves the spatial proximity essential for image generation and maintains full compatibility with current 2D generative models. To further reduce the inference cost, we enable fine-grained control and multi-domain generation within the next-scale prediction autoregressive framework to create an efficient multi-view multi-domain generative backbone. Extensive experiments show that PacTure outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality of generated PBR textures and efficiency in training and inference.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Image Generation via Dual-Level Feature Decoupling and Expert-Guided Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22360v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image generation models have led to a surge in subject-driven text-to-image generation, which aims to produce customized images that align with textual descriptions while preserving the identity of specific subjects. Despite significant progress, current methods struggle to disentangle identity-relevant information from identity-irrelevant details in the input images, resulting in overfitting or failure to maintain subject identity. In this work, we propose a novel framework that improves the separation of identity-related and identity-unrelated features and introduces an innovative feature fusion mechanism to improve the quality and text alignment of generated images. Our framework consists of two key components: an Implicit-Explicit foreground-background Decoupling Module (IEDM) and a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE). IEDM combines learnable adapters for implicit decoupling at the feature level with inpainting techniques for explicit foreground-background separation at the image level. FFM dynamically integrates identity-irrelevant features with identity-related features, enabling refined feature representations even in cases of incomplete decoupling. In addition, we introduce three complementary loss functions to guide the decoupling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in enhancing image generation quality, improving flexibility in scene adaptation, and increasing the diversity of generated outputs across various textual descriptions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their large number of parameters and high computational complexity limit their deployment on edge devices. Quantization can reduce storage requirements and accelerate inference by lowering the bit-width of model parameters. Yet, existing quantization methods for image generation models do not generalize well to video generation tasks. We identify two primary challenges: the loss of information during quantization and the misalignment between optimization objectives and the unique requirements of video generation. To address these challenges, we present Q-VDiT, a quantization framework specifically designed for video DiT models. From the quantization perspective, we propose the Token-aware Quantization Estimator (TQE), which compensates for quantization errors in both the token and feature dimensions. From the optimization perspective, we introduce Temporal Maintenance Distillation (TMD), which preserves the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and enables the optimization of each frame with respect to the overall video context. Our W3A6 Q-VDiT achieves a scene consistency of 23.40, setting a new benchmark and outperforming current state-of-the-art quantization methods by 1.9$\times$.

Early diffusion models emphasized perceptual quality, while newer multimodal models like GPT-4o-image integrate high-level reasoning, improving semantic understanding and structural composition. Scientific illustration generation exemplifies this evolution: unlike general image synthesis, it demands accurate interpretation of technical content and transformation of abstract ideas into clear, standardized visuals. This task is significantly more knowledge-intensive and laborious, often requiring hours of manual work and specialized tools. Automating it in a controllable, intelligent manner would provide substantial practical value. Yet, no benchmark currently exists to evaluate AI on this front. To fill this gap, we introduce SridBench, the first benchmark for scientific figure generation. It comprises 1,120 instances curated from leading scientific papers across 13 natural and computer science disciplines, collected via human experts and MLLMs. Each sample is evaluated along six dimensions, including semantic fidelity and structural accuracy. Experimental results reveal that even top-tier models like GPT-4o-image lag behind human performance, with common issues in text/visual clarity and scientific correctness. These findings highlight the need for more advanced reasoning-driven visual generation capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Key components such as the human preference alignment and classifier-free guidance play a crucial role in ensuring generation quality. However, their independent application in current text-to-image models continues to face significant challenges in achieving strong text-image alignment, high generation quality, and consistency with human aesthetic standards. In this work, we for the first time, explore facilitating the collaboration of human performance alignment and test-time sampling to unlock the potential of text-to-image models. Consequently, we introduce CHATS (Combining Human-Aligned optimization and Test-time Sampling), a novel generative framework that separately models the preferred and dispreferred distributions and employs a proxy-prompt-based sampling strategy to utilize the useful information contained in both distributions. We observe that CHATS exhibits exceptional data efficiency, achieving strong performance with only a small, high-quality funetuning dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CHATS surpasses traditional preference alignment methods, setting new state-of-the-art across various standard benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

While previous work on spatial grounding in image generation has mainly focused on 2D positioning, it lacks control over 3D orientation. To address this, we propose a reward-guided sampling approach using a pretrained discriminative model for 3D orientation estimation and a one-step text-to-image generative flow model. While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for reward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism. Instead, we adopt a sampling-based approach using Langevin dynamics, which extends gradient ascent by simply injecting random noise--requiring just a single additional line of code. Additionally, we introduce adaptive time rescaling based on the reward function to accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that ORIGEN outperforms both training-based and test-time guidance methods across quantitative metrics and user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://origen2025.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[Differentiable Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Plans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22049v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space, finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii) it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings. We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is essential.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[One-Way Ticket:Time-Independent Unified Encoder for Distilling Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21960v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in generative modeling; however, they face a trade-off between inference speed and image quality, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Existing distilled T2I models can generate high-fidelity images with fewer sampling steps, but often struggle with diversity and quality, especially in one-step models. From our analysis, we observe redundant computations in the UNet encoders. Our findings suggest that, for T2I diffusion models, decoders are more adept at capturing richer and more explicit semantic information, while encoders can be effectively shared across decoders from diverse time steps. Based on these observations, we introduce the first Time-independent Unified Encoder TiUE for the student model UNet architecture, which is a loop-free image generation approach for distilling T2I diffusion models. Using a one-pass scheme, TiUE shares encoder features across multiple decoder time steps, enabling parallel sampling and significantly reducing inference time complexity. In addition, we incorporate a KL divergence term to regularize noise prediction, which enhances the perceptual realism and diversity of the generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that TiUE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including LCM, SD-Turbo, and SwiftBrushv2, producing more diverse and realistic results while maintaining the computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR2025, Code: https://github.com/sen-mao/Loopfree</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/sen-mao/Loopfree) |

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing methods that rely on reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process, without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data, while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huanngzh.github.io/MIDI-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://huanngzh.github.io/MIDI-Page) |

Recent zero-shot approaches, particularly those leveraging diffusion transformers, incorporate reference image information through multi-modal attention mechanism. This integration allows the generated output to be influenced by both the textual prior from the prompt and the visual prior from the reference image. However, we observe that when the prompt and reference image are misaligned, the generated results exhibit a stronger bias toward the textual prior, leading to a significant loss of reference content. To address this issue, we propose AlignGen, a Cross-Modality Prior Alignment mechanism that enhances personalized image generation by: 1) introducing a learnable token to bridge the gap between the textual and visual priors, 2) incorporating a robust training strategy to ensure proper prior alignment, and 3) employing a selective cross-modal attention mask within the multi-modal attention mechanism to further align the priors. Experimental results demonstrate that AlignGen outperforms existing zero-shot methods and even surpasses popular test-time optimization approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

While effective, the low-rank constraint inherently limits representational capacity, often resulting in reduced performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning. Recent work by Ji et al. (2025) has addressed this limitation by applying a fixed-frequency sinusoidal transformation to low-rank adapters, increasing their stable rank without introducing additional parameters. This raises a crucial question: can the same sine-activated technique be successfully applied within the context of Post-Training Quantization to retain benefits even after model compression? In this paper, we investigate this question by extending the sinusoidal transformation framework to quantized LoRA adapters. We develop a theoretical analysis showing that the stable rank of a quantized adapter is tightly linked to that of its full-precision counterpart, motivating the use of such rank-enhancing functions even under quantization. Our results demonstrate that the expressivity gains from a sinusoidal non-linearity persist after quantization, yielding highly compressed adapters with negligible loss in performance. We validate our approach across a range of fine-tuning tasks for language, vision and text-to-image generation achieving significant memory savings while maintaining competitive accuracy.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures | None |

In this work, we explore how generative models can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for zero-shot multi-object perception.

Here, we provide a straightforward derivation of classifier-free and classifier-based guidance for discrete diffusion, as well as a new class of diffusion models that leverage uniform noise and that are more guidable because they can continuously edit their outputs. We improve the quality of these models with a novel continuous-time variational lower bound that yields state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings involving guidance or fast generation.

It is desirable for a variety of applications including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/sequence generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning of the base model is a popular approach but it can overfit the reward function while requiring significant resources. We frame controllable generation as a problem of finding a distribution that optimizes a KL-regularized objective function. We present SLCD -- Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion, which iteratively generates online data and trains a small classifier to guide the generation of the diffusion model. Similar to the standard classifier-guided diffusion, SLCD's key computation primitive is classification and does not involve any complex concepts from RL or control. Via a reduction to no-regret online learning analysis, we show that under KL divergence, the output from SLCD provably converges to the optimal solution of the KL-regularized objective. Further, we empirically demonstrate that SLCD can generate high quality samples with nearly the same inference time as the base model in both image generation with continuous diffusion and biological sequence generation with discrete diffusion.

However, existing research and evaluation standards predominantly focus on image realism and shallow text-image alignment, lacking a comprehensive assessment of complex semantic understanding and world knowledge integration in text to image generation. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{WISE}$, the first benchmark specifically designed for $\textbf{W}$orld Knowledge-$\textbf{I}$nformed $\textbf{S}$emantic $\textbf{E}$valuation.

These combine fine-tuned generators, adapters, upscaling blocks and even editing steps, leading to significant improvements in image quality. However, their effective design requires substantial expertise. Recent approaches have shown promise in automating this process through large language models (LLMs), but they suffer from two critical limitations: extensive computational requirements from generating images with hundreds of predefined pipelines, and poor generalization beyond memorized training examples. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework that addresses these inefficiencies. Our approach first trains an ensemble of reward models capable of predicting image quality scores directly from prompt-workflow combinations, eliminating the need for costly image generation during training. We then implement a two-phase training strategy: initial workflow vocabulary training followed by GRPO-based optimization that guides the model toward higher-performing regions of the workflow space. Additionally, we incorporate a classifier-free guidance based enhancement technique that extrapolates along the path between the initial and GRPO-tuned models, further improving output quality. We validate our approach through a set of comparisons, showing that it can successfully create new flows with greater diversity and lead to superior image quality compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

By learning a resolution-aware token sequence supervised with progressively degraded images, DetailFlow enables the generation process to start from the global structure and incrementally refine details. This coarse-to-fine 1D token sequence aligns well with the autoregressive inference mechanism, providing a more natural and efficient way for the AR model to generate complex visual content. Our compact 1D AR model achieves high-quality image synthesis with significantly fewer tokens than previous approaches, i.e. VAR/VQGAN. We further propose a parallel inference mechanism with self-correction that accelerates generation speed by approximately 8x while reducing accumulation sampling error inherent in teacher-forcing supervision. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, our method achieves 2.96 gFID with 128 tokens, outperforming VAR (3.3 FID) and FlexVAR (3.05 FID), which both require 680 tokens in their AR models. Moreover, due to the significantly reduced token count and parallel inference mechanism, our method runs nearly 2x faster inference speed compared to VAR and FlexVAR. Extensive experimental results demonstrate DetailFlow's superior generation quality and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation, where we achieve likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs.

Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and models.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce a new disentangled and controllable human synthesis task, which explicitly separates and manipulates these four factors within a unified framework. We first develop an end-to-end generative model trained on MVHumanNet for factor disentanglement. However, the domain gap between MVHumanNet and in-the-wild data produces unsatisfactory results, motivating the exploration of virtual try-on (VTON) dataset as a potential solution. Through experiments, we observe that simply incorporating the VTON dataset as additional data to train the end-to-end model degrades performance, primarily due to the inconsistency in data forms between the two datasets, which disrupts the disentanglement process. To better leverage both datasets, we propose a stage-by-stage framework that decomposes human image generation into three sequential steps: clothed A-pose generation, back-view synthesis, and pose and view control. This structured pipeline enables better dataset utilization at different stages, significantly improving controllability and generalization, especially for in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our stage-by-stage approach outperforms end-to-end models in both visual fidelity and disentanglement quality, offering a scalable solution for real-world tasks.

| **[Not All Thats Rare Is Lost: Causal Paths to Rare Concept Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20808v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in high-fidelity image generation but often falter when synthesizing rare concepts, i.e., prompts that are infrequently observed in the training distribution. In this paper, we introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens, we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics. Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines in both automated evaluations and human studies.</p></details> |  | None |

This raises concerns about the potential abuse of image generation, such as the creation of explicit or violent images, commonly referred to as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. To address this, the Stable Diffusion model includes several safety checkers to censor initial text prompts and final output images generated from the model. However, recent research has shown that these safety checkers have vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, allowing them to generate NSFW images. In this paper, we find that these adversarial attacks are not robust to small changes in text prompts or input latents. Based on this, we propose SC-Pro (Spherical or Circular Probing), a training-free framework that easily defends against adversarial attacks generating NSFW images. Moreover, we develop an approach that utilizes one-step diffusion models for efficient NSFW detection (SC-Pro-o), further reducing computational resources. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of performance and applicability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LeDiFlow: Learned Distribution-guided Flow Matching to Accelerate Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20723v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the efficiency of high-quality image generation using Diffusion Models (DMs) is a significant challenge due to the iterative nature of the process. Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior, which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the corresponding pixel-space baseline. Simultaneously, our latent FM model enhances image quality on average by 1.32x in CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) metric against its respective baseline.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in a few tasks, aspects, or modalities, and easily suffer from low consistency. In this paper, we argue that explicit, fine-grained aspect specification is the key to both generalizability and objectivity in automated evaluation. To this end, we propose a hierarchical aspect taxonomy encompassing 112 distinct aspects that unifies evaluation across four representative settings -- Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Building upon this taxonomy, we create FRABench, a benchmark comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k evaluation labels obtained from a combination of human and LLM annotations. FRABench provides the first large-scale, multi-modal resource for training and meta-evaluating fine-grained LMM judges. Leveraging FRABench, we develop GenEval, a fine-grained evaluator generalizable across tasks and modalities. Experiments show that GenEval (i) attains high agreement with GPT-4o and expert annotators, (ii) transfers robustly to unseen tasks and modalities, and (iii) reveals systematic weaknesses of current LMMs on evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), a deep learning framework that synthesizes black hole images directly from physical parameters. The model incorporates a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to enhance accuracy and stability. We have constructed a dataset of 2,157 GRRT-simulated images for training the BCDDM, which spans seven key physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. BCDDM offers a novel approach to reducing the computational costs of black hole image generation, providing a faster and more efficient pathway for dataset augmentation, parameter estimation, and model fitting.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10figures | None |

However, since style and appearance are often entangled, the existing methods struggle to preserve consistent subject characteristics while adhering to varying style prompts. Current approaches for consistent text-to-image generation typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning on curated image sets or per-subject optimization, which either fail to generalize across prompts or do not align well with textual descriptions. Meanwhile, training-free methods often fail to maintain subject consistency across different styles. In this work, we introduce a training-free method that achieves both style alignment and subject consistency. The attention matrices are manipulated such that Queries and Keys are obtained from the anchor image(s) that are used to define the subject, while the Values are imported from a parallel copy that is not subject-anchored. Additionally, cross-image components are added to the self-attention mechanism by expanding the Key and Value matrices. To do without shifting from the target style, we align the statistics of the Value matrices. As is demonstrated in a comprehensive battery of qualitative and quantitative experiments, our method effectively decouples style from subject appearance and enables faithful generation of text-aligned images with consistent characters across diverse styles.</p></details> |  | None |

Detecting and Evaluating Instruction-Guided Image Edits with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20405v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing models offer increased personalization opportunities in generative tasks. However, properly evaluating their results is challenging, and most of the existing metrics lag in terms of alignment with human judgment and explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce DICE (DIfference Coherence Estimator), a model designed to detect localized differences between the original and the edited image and to assess their relevance to the given modification request. DICE consists of two key components: a difference detector and a coherence estimator, both built on an autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trained using a strategy that leverages self-supervision, distillation from inpainting networks, and full supervision. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate each stage of our pipeline, comparing different MLLMs within the proposed framework. We demonstrate that DICE effectively identifies coherent edits, effectively evaluating images generated by different editing models with a strong correlation with human judgment. We publicly release our source code, models, and data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually takes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how to effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens are generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more constrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if a model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog and thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at later generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer perceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising paths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step annealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion steps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and gradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from our finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary to existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be implemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple, achieves $5-10\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\times$ for FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/Qinyu-Allen-Zhao/DiSA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Qinyu-Allen-Zhao/DiSA) |

The current de-facto standard of next token prediction commonly operates over a single-scale sequence of dense image tokens, and is incapable of utilizing global context especially for early tokens prediction. In this paper, we introduce a new autoregressive design to model a hierarchy from a few low-resolution image tokens to the typical dense image tokens, and delve into a thorough hierarchical dependency across multi-scale image tokens. Technically, we present a Hierarchical Masked Autoregressive models (Hi-MAR) that pivot on low-resolution image tokens to trigger hierarchical autoregressive modeling in a multi-phase manner. Hi-MAR learns to predict a few image tokens in low resolution, functioning as intermediary pivots to reflect global structure, in the first phase. Such pivots act as the additional guidance to strengthen the next autoregressive modeling phase by shaping global structural awareness of typical dense image tokens. A new Diffusion Transformer head is further devised to amplify the global context among all tokens for mask token prediction. Extensive evaluations on both class-conditional and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that Hi-MAR outperforms typical AR baselines, while requiring fewer computational costs.

However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models.

However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework.

The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring reconstruction quality for the ground user, we propose a novel metric to measure delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> | None |

However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 12 figures | None |

However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.</p></details> |  | None |

However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research.

However, complex tasks such as style-aligned text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt, resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our superior performance.</p></details> |  | None |

To fill this gap, we introduce Scene-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the factual consistency in generating natural scenes. Scene-Bench comprises MegaSG, a large-scale dataset of one million images annotated with scene graphs, facilitating the training and fair comparison of models across diverse and complex scenes. Additionally, we propose SGScore, a novel evaluation metric that leverages chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to assess both object presence and relationship accuracy, offering a more effective measure of factual consistency than traditional metrics like FID and CLIPScore. Building upon this evaluation framework, we develop a scene graph feedback pipeline that iteratively refines generated images by identifying and correcting discrepancies between the scene graph and the image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scene-Bench provides a more comprehensive and effective evaluation framework compared to existing benchmarks, particularly for complex scene generation. Furthermore, our feedback strategy significantly enhances the factual consistency of image generation models, advancing the field of controllable image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous attacks largely depend on the availability of the diffusion model or involve a lengthy optimization process. In this work, we investigate a more practical and universal attack that does not require the presence of a target model and demonstrate that the high-dimensional text embedding space inherently contains NSFW concepts that can be exploited to generate harmful images. We present the Jailbreaking Prompt Attack (JPA). JPA first searches for the target malicious concepts in the text embedding space using a group of antonyms generated by ChatGPT. Subsequently, a prefix prompt is optimized in the discrete vocabulary space to align malicious concepts semantically in the text embedding space. We further introduce a soft assignment with gradient masking technique that allows us to perform gradient ascent in the discrete vocabulary space. We perform extensive experiments with open-sourced T2I models, e.g. stable-diffusion-v1-4 and closed-sourced online services, e.g. DALLE2, Midjourney with black-box safety checkers. Results show that (1) JPA bypasses both text and image safety checkers (2) while preserving high semantic alignment with the target prompt. (3) JPA demonstrates a much faster speed than previous methods and can be executed in a fully automated manner. These merits render it a valuable tool for robustness evaluation in future text-to-image generation research.</p></details> |  | None |

While text-to-image models excel at producing high-fidelity, user-guided content, they often exhibit unpredictable behaviors and vulnerabilities that can be exploited to manipulate class or concept representations. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework to assess model reliability by analyzing responses to global and local perturbations in the embedding space, enabling the identification of inputs that trigger unreliable or biased behavior. Beyond social implications, fairness and diversity are fundamental to defining robust and trustworthy model behavior. Our approach offers deeper insights into these essential aspects by evaluating: (i) generative diversity, measuring the breadth of visual representations for learned concepts, and (ii) generative fairness, which examines the impact that removing concepts from input prompts has on control, under a low guidance setup. Beyond these evaluations, our method lays the groundwork for detecting unreliable, bias-injected models and tracing the provenance of embedded biases.

One potential approach is to utilize Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to build a self-correction framework. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the capabilities of the employed MLLM, often failing to account for all objects within the image. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the self-correction task into object-level subtasks according to three critical dimensions: counting, attributes, and spatial relationships. We construct a multi-agent self-correcting system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference. Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design. We will release the dataset and evaluation code to foster rigorous, unified evaluation and accelerate future innovations in multi-modal image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Text-to-Image generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text. TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However, existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility.

We present DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution. To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA), a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous driving frameworks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Understanding the Mechanisms of Classifier-Free Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19210v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a core technique powering state-of-the-art image generation systems, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we begin by analyzing CFG in a simplified linear diffusion model, where we show its behavior closely resembles that observed in the nonlinear case. Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and (iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the behavior of its nonlinear counterpart. Although the two eventually diverge at low noise levels, we discuss how the insights from the linear analysis still shed light on the CFG's mechanism in the nonlinear regime.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, Lavender aligns the text-vision attention in the VLM transformer with the equivalent used by Stable Diffusion during SFT, instead of adapting separate encoders. This alignment enriches the model's visual understanding and significantly boosts performance across in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Lavender requires just 0.13 million training examples, 2.5% of typical large-scale SFT datasets, and fine-tunes on standard hardware (8 GPUs) in a single day. It consistently improves state-of-the-art open-source multimodal LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2-11B, MiniCPM-Llama3-v2.5), achieving up to 30% gains and a 68% boost on challenging out-of-distribution medical QA tasks. By efficiently transferring the visual expertise of image generators with minimal supervision, Lavender offers a scalable solution for more accurate vision-language systems.

However, these techniques often fail to modify high-level semantic attributes of a class. To address this limitation, researchers have explored generative augmentation methods like the recently proposed DA-Fusion. Despite some progress, the variations are still largely limited to textural changes, thus falling short on aspects like varied viewpoints, environment, weather conditions, or even class-level semantic attributes (eg, variations in a dog's breed). To overcome this challenge, we propose DIAGen, building upon DA-Fusion. First, we apply Gaussian noise to the embeddings of an object learned with Textual Inversion to diversify generations using a pre-trained diffusion model's knowledge. Second, we exploit the general knowledge of a text-to-text generative model to guide the image generation of the diffusion model with varied class-specific prompts. Finally, we introduce a weighting mechanism to mitigate the impact of poorly generated samples. Experimental results across various datasets show that DIAGen not only enhances semantic diversity but also improves the performance of subsequent classifiers. The advantages of DIAGen over standard augmentations and the DA-Fusion baseline are particularly pronounced with out-of-distribution samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in GCPR 2024</p></details> | None |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized image generation method leveraging a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without requiring fine-tuning or any additional optimization, termed as OmniPainter. Specifically, we exploit the self-consistency property of latent consistency models to extract the representative style statistics from reference style images to guide the stylization process. Additionally, we then introduce the norm mixture of self-attention, which enables the model to query the most relevant style patterns from these statistics for the intermediate output content features. This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align closely with the distribution of the reference style images. Our qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://maxin-cn.github.io/omnipainter_project</p></details> | [Code Link](https://maxin-cn.github.io/omnipainter_project) |

However, the scalability of human feedback collection has been limited by its reliance on manual annotation. Therefore, we develop and test a method to automatically score user preferences from their spontaneous facial expression reaction to the generated images. We collect a dataset of Facial Expression Reaction to Generated Images (FERGI) and show that the activations of multiple facial action units (AUs) are highly correlated with user evaluations of the generated images. We develop an FAU-Net (Facial Action Units Neural Network), which receives inputs from an AU estimation model, to automatically score user preferences for text-to-image generation based on their facial expression reactions, which is complementary to the pre-trained scoring models based on the input text prompts and generated images. Integrating our FAU-Net valence score with the pre-trained scoring models improves their consistency with human preferences. This method of automatic annotation with facial expression analysis can be potentially generalized to other generation tasks.

This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal generative modeling.

Recent advances employ large language models (LLMs) for semantic-level detection, rendering traditional token-level perturbation attacks largely ineffective. However, our evaluation shows that existing jailbreak methods are ineffective against these modern filters. We introduce GhostPrompt, the first automated jailbreak framework that combines dynamic prompt optimization with multimodal feedback. It consists of two key components: (i) Dynamic Optimization, an iterative process that guides a large language model (LLM) using feedback from text safety filters and CLIP similarity scores to generate semantically aligned adversarial prompts; and (ii) Adaptive Safety Indicator Injection, which formulates the injection of benign visual cues as a reinforcement learning problem to bypass image-level filters. GhostPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing the ShieldLM-7B bypass rate from 12.5\% (Sneakyprompt) to 99.0\%, improving CLIP score from 0.2637 to 0.2762, and reducing the time cost by $4.2 \times$. Moreover, it generalizes to unseen filters including GPT-4.1 and successfully jailbreaks DALLE 3 to generate NSFW images in our evaluation, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current multimodal defenses. To support further research on AI safety and red-teaming, we will release code and adversarial prompts under a controlled-access protocol.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current benchmarks often lack the necessary breadth and depth to fully evaluate the diverse capabilities of these models. To overcome this limitation, we introduce OmniGenBench, a novel and comprehensive benchmark meticulously designed to assess the instruction-following abilities of state-of-the-art LMMs across both perception-centric and cognition-centric dimensions. Our OmniGenBench includes 57 diverse sub-tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, systematically categorized according to the specific model capabilities they demand. For rigorous evaluation, we further employ a dual-mode protocol. This protocol utilizes off-the-shelf visual parsing tools for perception-centric tasks and a powerful LLM-based judger for cognition-centric tasks to assess the alignment between generated images and user instructions. Using OmniGenBench, we evaluate mainstream generative models, including prevalent models like GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and Seedream, and provide in-depth comparisons and analyses of their performance.Code and data are available at https://github.com/emilia113/OmniGenBench.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/emilia113/OmniGenBench) |

However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the explicit alignment between generated images and prompts, neglecting the alignment with real-world knowledge beyond prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Align Beyond Prompts (ABP), a comprehensive benchmark designed to measure the alignment of generated images with real-world knowledge that extends beyond the explicit user prompts. ABP comprises over 2,000 meticulously crafted prompts, covering real-world knowledge across six distinct scenarios. We further introduce ABPScore, a metric that utilizes existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to assess the alignment between generated images and world knowledge beyond prompts, which demonstrates strong correlations with human judgments. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular T2I models using ABP, we find that even state-of-the-art models, such as GPT-4o, face limitations in integrating simple real-world knowledge into generated images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a training-free strategy within ABP, named Inference-Time Knowledge Injection (ITKI). By applying this strategy to optimize 200 challenging samples, we achieved an improvement of approximately 43% in ABPScore.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a popular Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, offers an efficient solution by optimizing only low-rank matrices. Despite recent progress in improving LoRA's performance, the relationship between the LoRA optimization space and the full parameter space is often overlooked. A solution that appears flat in the loss landscape of the LoRA space may still exhibit sharp directions in the full parameter space, potentially compromising generalization. We introduce Flat-LoRA, which aims to identify a low-rank adaptation situated in a flat region of the full parameter space. Instead of adopting the well-established sharpness-aware minimization approach, which incurs significant computation and memory overheads, we employ a Bayesian expectation loss objective to preserve training efficiency. Further, we design a refined random perturbation generation strategy for improved performance and carefully manage memory overhead using random seeds. Experiments across diverse tasks-including mathematical reasoning, coding abilities, dialogue generation, instruction following, and text-to-image generation-demonstrate that Flat-LoRA improves both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization.

Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://weizhi-zhong.github.io/Mod-Adapter</p></details> | [Code Link](https://weizhi-zhong.github.io/Mod-Adapter) |

In this work, we introduce RoleBench, a benchmark focused on evaluating compositional generalization in action-based relations (e.g., "mouse chasing cat"). We show that state-of-the-art T2I models and compositional approaches consistently default to frequent reversed relations (i.e., cat chasing mouse), a phenomenon we call RoleCollapse. Related works attribute this to the model's architectural limitation or being underrepresented in the data. Our key insight reveals that while models fail on rare compositions when their inversions are common, they can successfully generate similar intermediate compositions (e.g., "mouse chasing boy"), suggesting that this limitation is due to the presence of frequent counterparts rather than the absence of rare compositions. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that directional decomposition can gradually mitigate role collapse. We test this via ReBind, a lightweight framework that teaches role bindings using carefully selected active/passive intermediaries. Experiments suggest that intermediate compositions through intermediate fine-tuning can significantly mitigate role bias, with humans preferring more than 78% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the role of distributional asymmetries in compositional failures and offer a simple, effective path to improving generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

However, CLIP is still limited in negation understanding: the ability to recognize the absence or exclusion of a concept. Existing methods address the problem by using a large language model (LLM) to generate large-scale data of image captions containing negation for further fine-tuning CLIP. However, these methods are both time- and compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and (2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to produce semantically accurate images.

However, most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$ exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training (up to $\sim 50\%$ less) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models by incorporating extracted data features using pretrained lightweight latent variable models. Moving beyond natural images to generating fields arising from processes governed by physics, using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features, which adds interpretability to the generation process.</p></details> |  | None |

The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks.

However, UniDB's reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks, outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing inference time significantly.

Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets.

This paper explores frequency-based control within latent diffusion models. We first systematically analyze frequency characteristics across pixel space, VAE latent space, and internal LDM representations. This reveals that the "noise difference" term, derived from classifier-free guidance at each step t, is a uniquely effective and semantically rich target for manipulation. Building on this insight, we introduce FreSca, a novel and plug-and-play framework that decomposes noise difference into low- and high-frequency components and applies independent scaling factors to them via spatial or energy-based cutoffs. Essentially, FreSca operates without any model retraining or architectural change, offering model- and task-agnostic control. We demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness in improving generation quality and structural emphasis on multiple architectures (e.g., SD3, SDXL) and across applications including image generation, editing, depth estimation, and video synthesis, thereby unlocking a new dimension of expressive control within LDMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wikichao.github.io/FreSca/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wikichao.github.io/FreSca) |

This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.

Unfortunately, the lack of high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, conference paper</p></details> | None |

However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/restorevarpage/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sudraj2002.github.io/restorevarpage) |

However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting an important direction for future research.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper focuses on exploring the important notion of bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models. Providing a systematic foundation for this exploration, it establishes that at one extreme the diffusion models may amplify the inherent bias in the training data and, on the other, they may compromise the presumed privacy of the training samples. Our exploration aligns with the memorization-generalization understanding of the generative models, but it also expands further along this spectrum beyond ``generalization'', revealing the risk of bias amplification in deeper models. Building on the insights, we also introduce a training-free method to improve output quality in text-to-image and image-to-image generation. By progressively encouraging temporary high variance in the generation process with partial bypassing of the mid-block's contribution in the denoising process of DMs, our method consistently improves generative image quality with zero training cost. Our claims are validated both theoretically and empirically.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior work has attempted to enhance prompts using large language models (LLMs), these methods frequently generate stylistic or unrealistic content due to insufficient grounding in visual semantics and real-world composition. Inspired by recent advances in reasoning for language model, we propose RePrompt, a novel reprompting framework that introduces explicit reasoning into the prompt enhancement process via reinforcement learning. Instead of relying on handcrafted rules or stylistic rewrites, our method trains a language model to generate structured, self-reflective prompts by optimizing for image-level outcomes. The tailored reward models assesse the generated images in terms of human preference, semantic alignment, and visual composition, providing indirect supervision to refine prompt generation. Our approach enables end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experiments on GenEval and T2I-Compbench show that RePrompt significantly boosts spatial layout fidelity and compositional generalization across diverse T2I backbones, establishing new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/DKI_LLM/tree/main/RePrompt</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/microsoft/DKI_LLM) |

Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{CoRL}, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, \textbf{ULM-R1}, achieves average improvements of \textbf{7%} on three text-to-image generation datasets and \textbf{23%} on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery.

MDMs denoise by progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model, VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data, pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD consistently outperforms MDM baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures | None |

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey.

However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process, improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features. Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies. Extensive evaluations on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR/IV demonstrate that Diff3M achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing UAD methods in medical imaging.

Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures; accepted by ICML'25</p></details> | None |

A recent trend is the use of image generation models in anomaly localization, where these models generate normal-looking counterparts of anomalous images, thereby allowing flexible and adaptive anomaly localization. However, these methods inherit the uncertainty and bias implicitly embedded in the employed generative model, raising concerns about the reliability. To address this, we propose a statistical framework based on selective inference to quantify the significance of detected anomalous regions. Our method provides $p$-values to assess the false positive detection rates, providing a principled measure of reliability. As a proof of concept, we consider anomaly localization using a diffusion model and its applications to medical diagnoses and industrial inspections. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively controls the risk of false positive detection, supporting its use in high-stakes decision-making tasks.</p></details> | 38 pages, 10 figures | None |

Effective handling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content and spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement learning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building upon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined templates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this, we propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs to evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective supervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench benchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial relationships and attribute binding.

Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

The typical dual-branch architecture comprises two UNets for implicit garment deformation and synthesized image generation respectively, and has emerged as the recipe for VTON task. Nevertheless, the problem remains challenging to preserve the shape and every detail of the given garment due to the intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion model. To alleviate this issue, we novelly propose to explicitly capitalize on visual correspondence as the prior to tame diffusion process instead of simply feeding the whole garment into UNet as the appearance reference. Specifically, we interpret the fine-grained appearance and texture details as a set of structured semantic points, and match the semantic points rooted in garment to the ones over target person through local flow warping. Such 2D points are then augmented into 3D-aware cues with depth/normal map of target person. The correspondence mimics the way of putting clothing on human body and the 3D-aware cues act as semantic point matching to supervise diffusion model training. A point-focused diffusion loss is further devised to fully take the advantage of semantic point matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong garment detail preservation of our approach, evidenced by state-of-the-art VTON performances on both VITON-HD and DressCode datasets.

Recent advances enable tuning-free higher-resolution image generation by recycling pre-trained diffusion models and extending them via regional denoising or dilated sampling/convolutions. However, these models struggle to simultaneously preserve global semantic structure and produce creative regional details in higher-resolution images. To address this, we present C-Upscale, a new recipe of tuning-free image upscaling that pivots on global-regional priors derived from given global prompt and estimated regional prompts via Multimodal LLM. Technically, the low-frequency component of low-resolution image is recognized as global structure prior to encourage global semantic consistency in high-resolution generation. Next, we perform regional attention control to screen cross-attention between global prompt and each region during regional denoising, leading to regional attention prior that alleviates object repetition issue. The estimated regional prompts containing rich descriptive details further act as regional semantic prior to fuel the creativity of regional detail generation. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our C-Upscale manages to generate ultra-high-resolution images (e.g., 4,096 X 4,096 and 8,192 X 8,192) with higher visual fidelity and more creative regional details.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) 2025</p></details> | None |

One key concept in spatial cognition is the Frame of Reference (FoR), which identifies the perspective of spatial expressions. Despite its significance, FoR has received limited attention in AI models that need spatial intelligence. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and in-depth evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in this area. To address this issue, we introduce the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark, designed to assess FoR comprehension in LLMs. We evaluate LLMs on answering questions that require FoR comprehension and layout generation in text-to-image models using FoREST. Our results reveal a notable performance gap across different FoR classes in various LLMs, affecting their ability to generate accurate layouts for text-to-image generation. This highlights critical shortcomings in FoR comprehension. To improve FoR understanding, we propose Spatial-Guided prompting, which improves LLMs ability to extract essential spatial concepts.

First, most methods are built upon diffusion models, which are inherently ill-suited for equirectangular projection (ERP) panoramas due to the violation of the identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise assumption caused by their spherical mapping. Second, these methods often treat text-conditioned generation (text-to-panorama) and image-conditioned generation (panorama outpainting) as separate tasks, relying on distinct architectures and task-specific data. In this work, we propose a unified framework, Panoramic AutoRegressive model (PAR), which leverages masked autoregressive modeling to address these challenges. PAR avoids the i.i.d. assumption constraint and integrates text and image conditioning into a cohesive architecture, enabling seamless generation across tasks. To address the inherent discontinuity in existing generative models, we introduce circular padding to enhance spatial coherence and propose a consistency alignment strategy to improve generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in text-to-image generation and panorama outpainting tasks while showcasing promising scalability and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, existing methods train rewriting models with supervision from large amounts of manually annotated data and trained aesthetic assessment models. To alleviate the dependence on data scale for model training and the biases introduced by trained models, we propose a novel prompt optimization framework, designed to rephrase a simple user prompt into a sophisticated prompt to a text-to-image model. Specifically, we employ the large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt, and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards, i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified into one model and iterated in reinforcement learning to achieve self-improvement by giving a solution and judging itself. Results on two popular datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong competitors.</p></details> |  | None |

A key theoretical challenge is characterizing the distribution induced by CFG, particularly in high-dimensional settings relevant to real-world data. Previous works have shown that CFG modifies the target distribution, steering it towards a distribution sharper than the target one, more shifted towards the boundary of the class. In this work, we provide a high-dimensional analysis of CFG, showing that these distortions vanish as the data dimension grows. We present a blessing-of-dimensionality result demonstrating that in sufficiently high and infinite dimensions, CFG accurately reproduces the target distribution. Using our high-dimensional theory, we show that there is a large family of guidances enjoying this property, in particular non-linear CFG generalizations. We study a simple non-linear power-law version, for which we demonstrate improved robustness, sample fidelity and diversity. Our findings are validated with experiments on class-conditional and text-to-image generation using state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-matching models.</p></details> |  | None |

GeoBiked is curated to contain 4 355 bicycle images, annotated with structural and technical features and is used to investigate two automated labeling techniques: The utilization of consolidated latent features (Hyperfeatures) from image-generation models to detect geometric correspondences (e.g. the position of the wheel center) in structural images and the generation of diverse text descriptions for structural images. GPT-4o, a vision-language-model (VLM), is instructed to analyze images and produce diverse descriptions aligned with the system-prompt. By representing technical images as Diffusion-Hyperfeatures, drawing geometric correspondences between them is possible. The detection accuracy of geometric points in unseen samples is improved by presenting multiple annotated source images. GPT-4o has sufficient capabilities to generate accurate descriptions of technical images. Grounding the generation only on images leads to diverse descriptions but causes hallucinations, while grounding it on categorical labels restricts the diversity. Using both as input balances creativity and accuracy. Successfully using Hyperfeatures for geometric correspondence suggests that this approach can be used for general point-detection and annotation tasks in technical images. Labeling such images with text descriptions using VLMs is possible, but dependent on the models detection capabilities, careful prompt-engineering and the selection of input information. Applying foundation models in engineering design is largely unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap with a dataset to explore training, finetuning and conditioning DGMs in this field and suggesting approaches to bootstrap foundation models to process technical images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast Sampling Through The Reuse Of Attention Maps In Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01008v4)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities for flexible and realistic image synthesis. Nevertheless, these models rely on a time-consuming sampling procedure, which has motivated attempts to reduce their latency. When improving efficiency, researchers often use the original diffusion model to train an additional network designed specifically for fast image generation. In contrast, our approach seeks to reduce latency directly, without any retraining, fine-tuning, or knowledge distillation. In particular, we find the repeated calculation of attention maps to be costly yet redundant, and instead suggest reusing them during sampling. Our specific reuse strategies are based on ODE theory, which implies that the later a map is reused, the smaller the distortion in the final image. We empirically compare our reuse strategies with few-step sampling procedures of comparable latency, finding that reuse generates images that are closer to those produced by the original high-latency diffusion model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FPQVAR: Floating Point Quantization for Visual Autoregressive Model with FPGA Hardware Co-design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16335v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling has marked a paradigm shift in image generation from next-token prediction to next-scale prediction. VAR predicts a set of tokens at each step from coarse to fine scale, leading to better image quality and faster inference speed compared to existing diffusion models. However, the large parameter size and computation cost hinder its deployment on edge devices. To reduce the memory and computation cost, we propose FPQVAR, an efficient post-training floating-point (FP) quantization framework for VAR featuring algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithm level, we first identify the challenges of quantizing VAR. To address them, we propose Dual Format Quantization for the highly imbalanced input activation. We further propose Group-wise Hadamard Transformation and GHT-Aware Learnable Transformation to address the time-varying outlier channels. At the hardware level, we design the first low-bit FP quantizer and multiplier with lookup tables on FPGA and propose the first FPGA-based VAR accelerator featuring low-bit FP computation and an elaborate two-level pipeline. Extensive experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our proposed FPQVAR significantly improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 10.83 to 3.58, Inception Score (IS) from 175.9 to 241.5 under 4-bit quantization. FPQVAR also significantly improves the performance of 6-bit quantized VAR, bringing it on par with the FP16 model. Our accelerator on AMD-Xilinx VCK190 FPGA achieves a throughput of 1.1 image/s, which is 3.1x higher than the integer-based accelerator. It also demonstrates 3.6x and 2.8x higher energy efficiency compared to the integer-based accelerator and GPU baseline, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TensorAR: Refinement is All You Need in Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16324v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) image generators offer a language-model-friendly approach to image generation by predicting discrete image tokens in a causal sequence. However, unlike diffusion models, AR models lack a mechanism to refine previous predictions, limiting their generation quality. In this paper, we introduce TensorAR, a new AR paradigm that reformulates image generation from next-token prediction to next-tensor prediction. By generating overlapping windows of image patches (tensors) in a sliding fashion, TensorAR enables iterative refinement of previously generated content. To prevent information leakage during training, we propose a discrete tensor noising scheme, which perturbs input tokens via codebook-indexed noise. TensorAR is implemented as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing AR models. Extensive experiments on LlamaGEN, Open-MAGVIT2, and RAR demonstrate that TensorAR significantly improves the generation performance of autoregressive models.</p></details> |  | None |

The aim of this challenge is to address the fine-grained quality assessment of text-to-image generation models. This challenge evaluates text-to-image models from two aspects: image-text alignment and image structural distortion detection, and is divided into the alignment track and the structural track. The alignment track uses the EvalMuse-40K, which contains around 40K AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) generated by 20 popular generative models. The alignment track has a total of 371 registered participants. A total of 1,883 submissions are received in the development phase, and 507 submissions are received in the test phase. Finally, 12 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets. The structure track uses the EvalMuse-Structure, which contains 10,000 AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) with corresponding structural distortion mask. A total of 211 participants have registered in the structure track. A total of 1155 submissions are received in the development phase, and 487 submissions are received in the test phase. Finally, 8 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets. Almost all methods have achieved better results than baseline methods, and the winning methods in both tracks have demonstrated superior prediction performance on T2I model quality assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

Generative AI models have made it possible to create high-quality images, but concerns about copyright infringement are a hindrance to their abundant use. As these models use data from training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to ensure they do not violate intellectual property rights. Some AI models have even been noted to directly copy copyrighted images, a problem often referred to as source copying. Traditional copyright protection measures such as watermarks and metadata have also proven to be futile in this regard. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step image generation model inspired by the conditional diffusion model. The first step involves creating an image segmentation mask for some prompt-based generated images. This mask embodies the shape of the image. Thereafter, the diffusion model is asked to generate the image anew while avoiding the shape in question. This approach shows a decrease in structural similarity from the training image, i.e. we are able to avoid the source copying problem using this approach without expensive retraining of the model or user-centered prompt generation techniques. This makes our approach the most computationally inexpensive approach to avoiding both copyright infringement and source copying for diffusion model-based image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, published to IFIP International Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management</p></details> | None |

Mode collapse can arise due to the use of uninformed prior distributions in the generative learning task. To alleviate the issue of mode collapse for quantum GANs, this work presents a novel \textbf{hybrid quantum-classical generative model}, the VAE-QWGAN, which combines the strengths of a classical Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) with a hybrid Quantum Wasserstein GAN (QWGAN). The VAE-QWGAN fuses the VAE decoder and QWGAN generator into a single quantum model, and utilizes the VAE encoder for data-dependant latent vector sampling during training. This in turn, enhances the diversity and quality of generated images. To generate new data from the trained model at inference, we sample from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior that is learnt on the latent vectors generated during training. We conduct extensive experiments for image generation QGANs on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets and compute a range of metrics that measure the diversity and quality of generated samples. We show that VAE-QWGAN demonstrates significant improvement over existing QGAN approaches.</p></details> | 30 pages, 13 figures | None |

Trained via flow matching, PO-Flow provides a unified framework for individualized potential outcome prediction, counterfactual predictions, and uncertainty-aware density learning. Among generative models, it is the first to enable density learning of potential outcomes without requiring explicit distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian mixtures), while also supporting counterfactual prediction conditioned on factual outcomes in general observational datasets. On benchmarks such as ACIC, IHDP, and IBM, it consistently outperforms prior methods across a range of causal inference tasks. Beyond that, PO-Flow succeeds in high-dimensional settings, including counterfactual image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their inference process remains computationally expensive due to the repeated evaluation of resource-intensive attention and feed-forward modules. To address this, we introduce SmoothCache, a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiT architectures. SmoothCache leverages the observed high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities. We showcase its effectiveness on DiT-XL for image generation, Open-Sora for text-to-video, and Stable Audio Open for text-to-audio, highlighting its potential to enable real-time applications and broaden the accessibility of powerful DiT models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at https://github.com/Roblox/SmoothCache.

The approach is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL) stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and development.

For example, a T2I model released in February would struggle to generate a suitable poster for a movie premiering in April, because the character designs and styles are uncertain to the model. To solve this problem, we propose an Internet-Augmented text-to-image generation (IA-T2I) framework to compel T2I models clear about such uncertain knowledge by providing them with reference images. Specifically, an active retrieval module is designed to determine whether a reference image is needed based on the given text prompt; a hierarchical image selection module is introduced to find the most suitable image returned by an image search engine to enhance the T2I model; a self-reflection mechanism is presented to continuously evaluate and refine the generated image to ensure faithful alignment with the text prompt. To evaluate the proposed framework's performance, we collect a dataset named Img-Ref-T2I, where text prompts include three types of uncertain knowledge: (1) known but rare. (2) unknown. (3) ambiguous. Moreover, we carefully craft a complex prompt to guide GPT-4o in making preference evaluation, which has been shown to have an evaluation accuracy similar to that of human preference evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming GPT-4o by about 30% in human evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, a framework that integrates reference images from the Internet into T2I/TI2I models</p></details> | None |

We challenge this established paradigm by demonstrating that one can match or outperform models trained on massive web-scraped collections, using only ImageNet enhanced with well-designed text and image augmentations. With this much simpler setup, we achieve a +1% overall score over SD-XL on GenEval and +0.5% on DPGBench while using just 1/10th the parameters and 1/1000th the training images. This opens the way for more reproducible research as ImageNet is a widely available dataset and our standardized training setup does not require massive compute resources.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances in image generation have enabled high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations, we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose, expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead. Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion, while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages(excluding references), 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Previous studies have demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR images. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the pre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications to the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve the effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a backdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack success rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias. Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |

Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 10 figures, 15 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce Sparc3D, a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes representation Sparcubes with a novel encoder Sparconv-VAE. Sparcubes converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse cube, allowing differentiable optimization. Sparconv-VAE is the first modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion. Sparc3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs, including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry.

Existing methods often rely on simplistic metrics like caption length to represent the detailness of the caption in the T2I training set. In this paper, we propose a new metric to estimate caption detailness based on two aspects: image coverage rate (ICR), which evaluates whether the caption covers all regions/objects in the image, and average object detailness (AOD), which quantifies the detailness of each object's description. Through experiments on the COCO dataset using ShareGPT4V captions, we demonstrate that T2I models trained on high-ICR and -AOD captions achieve superior performance on DPG and other benchmarks. Notably, our metric enables more effective data selection-training on only 20% of full data surpasses both full-dataset training and length-based selection method, improving alignment and reconstruction ability. These findings highlight the critical role of detail-aware metrics over length-based heuristics in caption selection for T2I tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems--including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants--demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI-driven content generation.</p></details> |  | None |

At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are most notable in low-data regimes, demonstrating DIST2Loss's strength under resource constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Distributional Vision-Language Alignment by Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17028v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal alignment is crucial for various downstream tasks such as cross-modal generation and retrieval. Previous multimodal approaches like CLIP utilize InfoNCE to maximize mutual information, primarily aligning pairwise samples across modalities while overlooking distributional differences. In addition, InfoNCE has inherent conflict in terms of alignment and uniformity in multimodality, leading to suboptimal alignment with modality gaps. To overcome the limitations, we propose CS-Aligner, a novel framework that performs distributional vision-language alignment by integrating Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence with mutual information. CS-Aligner captures both the global distribution information of each modality and the pairwise semantic relationships. We find that the CS divergence seamlessly addresses the InfoNCE's alignment-uniformity conflict and serves complementary roles with InfoNCE, yielding tighter and more precise alignment. Moreover, by introducing distributional alignment, CS-Aligner enables incorporating additional information from unpaired data and token-level representations, enhancing flexible and fine-grained alignment in practice. Experiments on text-to-image generation and cross-modality retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on vision-language alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available in https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen) |

However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

We study the full training pipeline of UniGen from a data-centric perspective, including multi-stage pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. More importantly, we propose a new Chain-of-Thought Verification (CoT-V) strategy for test-time scaling, which significantly boosts UniGen's image generation quality using a simple Best-of-N test-time strategy. Specifically, CoT-V enables UniGen to act as both image generator and verifier at test time, assessing the semantic alignment between a text prompt and its generated image in a step-by-step CoT manner. Trained entirely on open-source datasets across all stages, UniGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of image understanding and generation benchmarks, with a final score of 0.78 on GenEval and 85.19 on DPG-Bench. Through extensive ablation studies, our work provides actionable insights and addresses key challenges in the full life cycle of building unified MLLMs, contributing meaningful directions to the future research.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[Training-Free Watermarking for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14673v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent malicious misuse of visual generative models. However, existing generative watermarking methods are mainly designed for diffusion models while watermarking for autoregressive image generation models remains largely underexplored. We propose IndexMark, a training-free watermarking framework for autoregressive image generation models. IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary validation scheme to enhance robustness against cropping attacks. Experiments demonstrate that IndexMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and verification accuracy, and exhibits robustness against various perturbations, including cropping, noises, Gaussian blur, random erasing, color jittering, and JPEG compression.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StainDiffuser: MultiTask Dual Diffusion Model for Virtual Staining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11340v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is widely regarded as the standard in pathology for diagnosing diseases and tracking tumor recurrence. While H&E staining shows tissue structures, it lacks the ability to reveal specific proteins that are associated with disease severity and treatment response. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains use antibodies to highlight the expression of these proteins on their respective cell types, improving diagnostic accuracy, and assisting with drug selection for treatment. Despite their value, IHC stains require additional time and resources, limiting their utilization in some clinical settings. Recent advances in deep learning have positioned Image-to-Image (I2I) translation as a computational, cost-effective alternative for IHC. I2I generates high fidelity stain transformations digitally, potentially replacing manual staining in IHC. Diffusion models, the current state of the art in image generation and conditional tasks, are particularly well suited for virtual IHC due to their ability to produce high quality images and resilience to mode collapse. However, these models require extensive and diverse datasets (often millions of samples) to achieve a robust performance, a challenge in virtual staining applications where only thousands of samples are typically available. Inspired by the success of multitask deep learning models in scenarios with limited data, we introduce STAINDIFFUSER, a novel multitask diffusion architecture tailored to virtual staining that achieves convergence with smaller datasets. STAINDIFFUSER simultaneously trains two diffusion processes: (a) generating cell specific IHC stains from H&E images and (b) performing H&E based cell segmentation, utilizing coarse segmentation labels exclusively during training. STAINDIFFUSER generates high-quality virtual stains for two markers, outperforming over twenty I2I baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce SparC, a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes representation SparseCubes with a novel encoder SparConv-VAE. SparseCubes converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse cube, allowing differentiable optimization. SparConv-VAE is the first modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion. SparC achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs, including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry. It preserves fine-grained shape details, reduces training and inference cost, and integrates naturally with latent diffusion models for scalable, high-resolution 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://lizhihao6.github.io/SparC</p></details> | [Code Link](https://lizhihao6.github.io/SparC) |

While more layers can lead to better performance, this approach has been challenged as far from efficient, especially given the superiority of continuous layers demonstrated by diffusion and flow-based models for image generation. We propose the Latent Flow Transformer (LFT), which replaces a block of layers with a single learned transport operator trained via flow matching, offering significant compression while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture. Additionally, we address the limitations of existing flow-based methods in \textit{preserving coupling} by introducing the Flow Walking (FW) algorithm. On the Pythia-410M model, LFT trained with flow matching compresses 6 of 24 layers and outperforms directly skipping 2 layers (KL Divergence of LM logits at 0.407 vs. 0.529), demonstrating the feasibility of this design. When trained with FW, LFT further distills 12 layers into one while reducing the KL to 0.736 surpassing that from skipping 3 layers (0.932), significantly narrowing the gap between autoregressive and flow-based generation paradigms.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, the potential of reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions, and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like super-resolution and image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Personalizing generative models through fine-tuning with theme-specific data has become a prevalent approach in text-to-image generation. However, unlike object customization, which focuses on learning specific objects, theme-specific generation encompasses diverse elements such as characters, scenes, and objects. Such diversity also introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively generate multi-character, multi-concept, and continuous theme-specific images (TSI). Moreover, fine-tuning approaches often come with significant computational overhead, time costs, and risks of overfitting. This paper explores a fundamental question: Can image generation models directly leverage images as contextual input, similarly to how large language models use text as context? To address this, we present IP-Prompter, a novel training-free TSI generation method. IP-Prompter introduces visual prompting, a mechanism that integrates reference images into generative models, allowing users to seamlessly specify the target theme without requiring additional training. To further enhance this process, we propose a Dynamic Visual Prompting (DVP) mechanism, which iteratively optimizes visual prompts to improve the accuracy and quality of generated images. Our approach enables diverse applications, including consistent story generation, character design, realistic character generation, and style-guided image generation. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art personalization methods demonstrate that IP-Prompter achieves significantly better results and excels in maintaining character identity preserving, style consistency and text alignment, offering a robust and flexible solution for theme-specific image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGGRAPH 2025.

Under the new paradigm of first pre-training on massive image-text pairs and then fine-tuning on task-specific data, VLM in the remote sensing domain has made significant progress. The resulting models benefit from the absorption of extensive general knowledge and demonstrate strong performance across a variety of remote sensing data analysis tasks. Moreover, they are capable of interacting with users in a conversational manner. In this paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with a timely and comprehensive review of the developments in VLM using the two-stage paradigm. Specifically, we first cover a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing: contrastive learning, visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image generation. For each category, we detail the commonly used network architecture and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a thorough review of existing works, examining foundation models and task-specific adaptation methods in contrastive-based VLM, architectural upgrades, training strategies and model capabilities in instruction-based VLM, as well as generative foundation models with their representative downstream applications. Third, we summarize datasets used for VLM pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, with an analysis of their construction methodologies (including image sources and caption generation) and key properties, such as scale and task adaptability. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions: cross-modal representation alignment, vague requirement comprehension, explanation-driven model reliability, continually scalable model capabilities, and large-scale datasets featuring richer modalities and greater challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> | None |

Many existing approaches rely on text prompts as editing guidance. However, these methods are constrained by the need for manual prompt crafting, which can be time-consuming, introduce irrelevant details, and significantly limit editing performance. In this work, we propose optimizing semantic embeddings guided by attribute classifiers to steer text-to-image models toward desired edits, without relying on text prompts or requiring any training or fine-tuning of the diffusion model. We utilize classifiers to learn precise semantic embeddings at the dataset level. The learned embeddings are theoretically justified as the optimal representation of attribute semantics, enabling disentangled and accurate edits. Experiments further demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of disentanglement and strong generalization across different domains of data.</p></details> |  | None |

These models are being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and 95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike previous work that jointly models the global hair structure and local curl patterns, we propose to disentangle them using a PCA-based strand representation in the frequency domain, thereby allowing more precise editing and output control. Specifically, we leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry textures into low- to high-frequency hair structures, termed guide textures and residual textures, respectively. These decomposed textures are later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common stages in the hair grooming process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the architecture design of Perm, and finally deploy the trained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further showcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as single-view hair reconstruction, hairstyle editing, and hair-conditioned image generation.

While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  | None |

The quality of the VT largely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current discrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders (VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of details and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality, without isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core tasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and covers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess state-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of reconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior visual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining spatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded representations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted reconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text and object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image generation and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the role of visual tokenization. We release our benchmark and codebase publicly to support further research and call on the community to develop strong, general-purpose open-source VTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality.

However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images. Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses, including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and producing strong log-likelihood bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow \textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}), accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance.

As a result, merging existing datasets has become a common strategy. However, the sets of attributes across datasets are often inconsistent, and their naive concatenation typically leads to block-wise missing conditions. This presents a significant challenge for conditional generative modeling when the multiple attributes are used jointly as conditions, thereby limiting the model's controllability and applicability. To address this issue, we propose a novel generative approach, Diffusion Model with Double Guidance, which enables precise conditional generation even when no training samples contain all conditions simultaneously. Our method maintains rigorous control over multiple conditions without requiring joint annotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in molecular and image generation tasks, where it outperforms existing baselines both in alignment with target conditional distributions and in controllability under missing condition settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.</p></details> | <details><summary>L.

Unlike previous works that employ an open-loop approach and pre-define prompts to generate new data using either a language model or human expertise, we develop an automated closed-loop system which involves two feedback mechanisms. The first mechanism uses feedback from a given supervised model and finds adversarial prompts that result in image generations that maximize the model loss. While these adversarial prompts result in diverse data informed by the model, they are not informed of the target distribution, which can be inefficient. Therefore, we introduce the second feedback mechanism that guides the generation process towards a certain target distribution. We call the method combining these two mechanisms Guided Adversarial Prompts. We perform our evaluations on different tasks, datasets and architectures, with different types of distribution shifts (spuriously correlated data, unseen domains) and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed feedback mechanisms compared to open-loop approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://adversarial-prompts.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |

Recently, the generative capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AIM Workshop 2024 at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |

In this work, we take a data-driven approach to address this question by analyzing interpretable, monosemantic features extracted from deep multimodal models. Specifically, we investigate CLIP, a prominent visual-language representation model trained on massive image-text pairs. Building on prior research in single-modal interpretability, we develop a set of multi-modal interpretability tools and measures designed to disentangle and analyze features learned from CLIP. Specifically, we introduce the Modality Dominance Score (MDS) to attribute each CLIP feature to a specific modality. We then map CLIP features into a more interpretable space, enabling us to categorize them into three distinct classes: vision features (single-modal), language features (single-modal), and visual-language features (cross-modal). Interestingly, this data-driven categorization closely aligns with human intuitive understandings of different modalities. We further show that this modality decomposition can benefit multiple downstream tasks, including reducing bias in gender detection, generating cross-modal adversarial examples, and enabling modal-specific feature control in text-to-image generation. These results indicate that large-scale multimodal models, when equipped with task-agnostic interpretability tools, can offer valuable insights into the relationships between different data modalities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DeLoRA: Decoupling Angles and Strength in Low-rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18225v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have recently gained significant popularity thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale pretrained models. These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness.

| **[Accelerate TarFlow Sampling with GS-Jacobi Iteration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12849v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation models have achieved widespread applications. As an instance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with Normalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential computation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling can be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as GS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow model have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in image generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some blocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while others are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose the Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM is used to identify whether a TarFlow block is "simple" (converges in few iterations) or "tough" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate whether the initial value of the iteration is good. Experiments on four TarFlow models demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling efficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID), achieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in Img64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample quality.

An essential technique for improving the sample quality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale to obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided sampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100 to 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated high-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance, their effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In this work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from instability issues, and they even become slower than DDIM when the guidance scale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose DPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++ solves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding methods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further propose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by reducing the effective step size. Experiments show that DPM-Solver++ can generate high-quality samples within only 15 to 20 steps for guided sampling by pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Intelligence Research</p></details> | None |

Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in a few tasks, aspects, or modalities, and easily suffer from low consistency. In this paper, we argue that explicit, fine-grained aspect specification is the key to both generalizability and objectivity in automated evaluation. To do so, we introduce a hierarchical aspect taxonomy spanning 112 aspects that unifies evaluation across four representative settings - Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Building on this taxonomy, we create FRAbench, a benchmark comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k aspect-level labels obtained from a combination of human and LLM annotations. FRAbench provides the first large-scale, multi-modal resource for training and meta-evaluating fine-grained LMM judges. Leveraging FRAbench, we develop GenEval, a fine-grained evaluator generalizable across tasks and modalities. Experiments show that GenEval (i) attains high agreement with GPT-4o and expert annotators, (ii) transfers robustly to unseen tasks and modalities, and (iii) reveals systematic weaknesses of current LMMs on evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC).

How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior audio-to-image generation methods typically rely on general-purpose datasets and overlook geographic and environmental contexts, resulting in unrealistic images that are misaligned with real-world environmental settings. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel geo-contextual computational framework that explicitly integrates geographic knowledge into multimodal generative modeling. We construct two large-scale geo-contextual multimodal datasets, SoundingSVI and SonicUrban, pairing diverse soundscapes with real-world landscape images. We propose SounDiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based model that incorporates geo-contextual scene conditioning to synthesize geographically coherent landscape images. Furthermore, we propose a practically-informed geo-contextual evaluation framework, the Place Similarity Score (PSS), across element-, scene-, and human perception-levels to measure consistency between input soundscapes and generated landscape images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SounDiT outperforms existing baselines in both visual fidelity and geographic settings. Our work not only establishes foundational benchmarks for GeoS2L generation but also highlights the importance of incorporating geographic domain knowledge in advancing multimodal generative models, opening new directions at the intersection of generative AI, geography, urban planning, and environmental sciences.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Diff-MM: Exploring Pre-trained Text-to-Image Generation Model for Unified Multi-modal Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12606v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object tracking integrates auxiliary modalities such as depth, thermal infrared, event flow, and language to provide additional information beyond RGB images, showing great potential in improving tracking stabilization in complex scenarios. Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data. Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Synthetic History: Evaluating Visual Representations of the Past in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17064v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned TTI models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Selftok: Discrete Visual Tokens of Autoregression, by Diffusion, and for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07538v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Guiding Diffusion with Deep Geometric Moments: Balancing Fidelity and Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12486v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable capabilities in synthesizing images, but often struggle to provide fine-grained control over the output. Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments. Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for steering the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR Workshop GMCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[UniCMs: A Unified Consistency Model For Efficient Multimodal Generation and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05415v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency models (CMs) have shown promise in the efficient generation of both image and text. This raises the natural question of whether we can learn a unified CM for efficient multimodal generation (e.g., text-to-image) and understanding (e.g., image-to-text). Intuitively, such a model could be acquired by applying the consistency distillation (CD) to existing unified multimodal models. However, the key challenge is establishing a unified denoising perspective for both image and text generation, which is essential for establishing the consistency mapping. To tackle this, at the representation level, we advocate for discrete tokens for both modalities to best preserve language modeling capabilities. Critically, instead of defining the text denoising trajectory via recent discrete diffusion language modeling principles, we specify it using the parallel decoding trace of an autoregressive language model, benefiting from the latter's superior performance in general text generation tasks. The denoising trajectory of image tokens adheres to standard discrete diffusion. We train our unified consistency models (UniCMs) on these combined multimodal trajectories simultaneously with a unified objective. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy to further improve the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation, UniCMs outperform SD3 on GenEval, Image Reward, and CLIP Score metrics, while requiring only approximately ${1}/{8}$ of the sampling time. Meanwhile, in image-to-text generation, UniCMs surpass Show-o on the MMMU benchmark while being $1.5 \times$ faster at long-sequence generating speed.

There are many such models which, given a prompt of a text, will generate an image which depicts said prompt. There are many image generation models, such as Latent Diffusion Models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Generative Adversarial Networks and many more. When generating images, these models can generate sensitive image data, which can be threatening to privacy or may violate copyright laws of private entities. Machine unlearning aims at removing the influence of specific data subsets from the trained models and in the case of image generation models, remove the influence of a concept such that the model is unable to generate said images of the concept when prompted. Conventional retraining of the model can take upto days, hence fast algorithms are the need of the hour. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to remove the influence of concepts in diffusion models through updating the gradients of the final layers of the text encoders. Using a weighted loss function, we utilize backpropagation in order to update the weights of the final layers of the Text Encoder componet of the Stable Diffusion Model, removing influence of the concept from the text-image embedding space, such that when prompted, the result is an image not containing the concept. The weighted loss function makes use of Textual Inversion and Low-Rank Adaptation.We perform our experiments on Latent Diffusion Models, namely the Stable Diffusion v2 model, with an average concept unlearning runtime of 50 seconds using 4-5 images.</p></details> |  | None |

Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that, despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future research toward dependable and generalizable AIGI detection.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

However, model reuse across distinct modalities (e.g., text and vision) remains limited due to the difficulty of aligning internal representations. Existing methods require extensive paired training data or are constrained to specific domains. We introduce a semi-supervised approach for model alignment via conditional flow matching. The conditional flow between latent spaces of different modalities (e.g., text-to-image or biological-to-artificial neuronal activity) can be learned in two settings: ($1$) solving a (balanced or unbalanced) optimal transport problem with an inter-space bridge cost, and ($2$) performing memory-efficient alignment using labelled exemplars. Despite being constrained by the original models' capacity, our method--under both settings--matches downstream task performance of end-to-end trained models on object recognition and image generation tasks across MNIST, ImageNet, and \cite{majaj2015simple} datasets, particularly when labelled training data is scarce ($<20\%$). Our method provides a data-efficient solution for inter-modal model alignment with minimal supervision.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike diffusion architectures, autoregressive models can naturally incorporate arbitrary modalities into a single, unified token sequence--offering a concise solution for multi-conditional image generation tasks. In this work, we propose $\textbf{ContextAR}$, a flexible and effective framework for multi-conditional image generation. ContextAR embeds diverse conditions (e.g., canny edges, depth maps, poses) directly into the token sequence, preserving modality-specific semantics. To maintain spatial alignment while enhancing discrimination among different condition types, we introduce hybrid positional encodings that fuse Rotary Position Embedding with Learnable Positional Embedding. We design Conditional Context-aware Attention to reduces computational complexity while preserving effective intra-condition perception. Without any fine-tuning, ContextAR supports arbitrary combinations of conditions during inference time. Experimental results demonstrate the powerful controllability and versatility of our approach, and show that the competitive perpormance than diffusion-based multi-conditional control approaches the existing autoregressive baseline across diverse multi-condition driven scenarios.

In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the image restoration community. We present the first systematic evaluation of GPT-4o across diverse restoration tasks. Our experiments reveal that, although restoration outputs from GPT-4o are visually appealing, they often suffer from pixel-level structural fidelity when compared to ground-truth images. Common issues are variations in image proportions, shifts in object positions and quantities, and changes in viewpoint. To address it, taking image dehazing, derainning, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show that GPT-4o's outputs can serve as powerful visual priors, substantially enhancing the performance of existing dehazing networks. It offers practical guidelines and a baseline framework to facilitate the integration of GPT-4o into future image restoration pipelines. We hope the study on GPT-4o image restoration will accelerate innovation in the broader field of image generation areas.

In this work, we take the idea of structural guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image generation models can directly provide a plausible fine-grained structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts, instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025.
