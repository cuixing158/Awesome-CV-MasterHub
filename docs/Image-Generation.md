| **[MMaDA: Multimodal Large Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15809v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL) stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and development.

| **[IA-T2I: Internet-Augmented Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15779v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models achieve promising results, but they fail on the scenarios where the knowledge implied in the text prompt is uncertain. For example, a T2I model released in February would struggle to generate a suitable poster for a movie premiering in April, because the character designs and styles are uncertain to the model. To solve this problem, we propose an Internet-Augmented text-to-image generation (IA-T2I) framework to compel T2I models clear about such uncertain knowledge by providing them with reference images. Specifically, an active retrieval module is designed to determine whether a reference image is needed based on the given text prompt; a hierarchical image selection module is introduced to find the most suitable image returned by an image search engine to enhance the T2I model; a self-reflection mechanism is presented to continuously evaluate and refine the generated image to ensure faithful alignment with the text prompt. To evaluate the proposed framework's performance, we collect a dataset named Img-Ref-T2I, where text prompts include three types of uncertain knowledge: (1) known but rare. (2) unknown. (3) ambiguous. Moreover, we carefully craft a complex prompt to guide GPT-4o in making preference evaluation, which has been shown to have an evaluation accuracy similar to that of human preference evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming GPT-4o by about 30% in human evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, a framework that integrates reference images from the Internet into T2I/TI2I models</p></details> | None |
| **[How far can we go with ImageNet for Text-to-Image generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21318v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable results by training on billion-scale datasets, following a `bigger is better' paradigm that prioritizes data quantity over availability (closed vs open source) and reproducibility (data decay vs established collections). We challenge this established paradigm by demonstrating that one can match or outperform models trained on massive web-scraped collections, using only ImageNet enhanced with well-designed text and image augmentations. With this much simpler setup, we achieve a +1% overall score over SD-XL on GenEval and +0.5% on DPGBench while using just 1/10th the parameters and 1/1000th the training images. This opens the way for more reproducible research as ImageNet is a widely available dataset and our standardized training setup does not require massive compute resources.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FaceCrafter: Identity-Conditional Diffusion with Disentangled Control over Facial Pose, Expression, and Emotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15313v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human facial images encode a rich spectrum of information, encompassing both stable identity-related traits and mutable attributes such as pose, expression, and emotion. While recent advances in image generation have enabled high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations, we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose, expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead. Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion, while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages(excluding references), 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[BadSR: Stealthy Label Backdoor Attacks on Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15308v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of super-resolution (SR) in various fields, researchers have begun to investigate its security. Previous studies have demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR images. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the pre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications to the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve the effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a backdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack success rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MLEP: Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns for Universal AI-generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13726v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in image generation technologies have raised significant concerns about their potential misuse, such as producing misinformation and deepfakes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias. Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $Î¼$P](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15270v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 10 figures, 15 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[MagicTailor: Component-Controllable Personalization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13370v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models can generate high-quality images but lack fine-grained control of visual concepts, limiting their creativity. Thus, we introduce component-controllable personalization, a new task that enables users to customize and reconfigure individual components within concepts. This task faces two challenges: semantic pollution, where undesired elements disrupt the target concept, and semantic imbalance, which causes disproportionate learning of the target concept and component. To address these, we design MagicTailor, a framework that uses Dynamic Masked Degradation to adaptively perturb unwanted visual semantics and Dual-Stream Balancing for more balanced learning of desired visual semantics. The experimental results show that MagicTailor achieves superior performance in this task and enables more personalized and creative image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025 (Project page: https://correr-zhou.github.io/MagicTailor)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://correr-zhou.github.io/MagicTailor) |
| **[Sparc3D: Sparse Representation and Construction for High-Resolution 3D Shapes Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14521v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity 3D object synthesis remains significantly more challenging than 2D image generation due to the unstructured nature of mesh data and the cubic complexity of dense volumetric grids. Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce Sparc3D, a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes representation Sparcubes with a novel encoder Sparconv-VAE. Sparcubes converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse cube, allowing differentiable optimization. Sparconv-VAE is the first modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion. Sparc3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs, including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry. It preserves fine-grained shape details, reduces training and inference cost, and integrates naturally with latent diffusion models for scalable, high-resolution 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://lizhihao6.github.io/Sparc3D</p></details> | [Code Link](https://lizhihao6.github.io/Sparc3D) |
| **[Harnessing Caption Detailness for Data-Efficient Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15172v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training text-to-image (T2I) models with detailed captions can significantly improve their generation quality. Existing methods often rely on simplistic metrics like caption length to represent the detailness of the caption in the T2I training set. In this paper, we propose a new metric to estimate caption detailness based on two aspects: image coverage rate (ICR), which evaluates whether the caption covers all regions/objects in the image, and average object detailness (AOD), which quantifies the detailness of each object's description. Through experiments on the COCO dataset using ShareGPT4V captions, we demonstrate that T2I models trained on high-ICR and -AOD captions achieve superior performance on DPG and other benchmarks. Notably, our metric enables more effective data selection-training on only 20% of full data surpasses both full-dataset training and length-based selection method, improving alignment and reconstruction ability. These findings highlight the critical role of detail-aware metrics over length-based heuristics in caption selection for T2I tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Teaching Metric Distance to Autoregressive Multimodal Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02379v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are most notable in low-data regimes, demonstrating DIST2Loss's strength under resource constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Distributional Vision-Language Alignment by Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17028v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal alignment is crucial for various downstream tasks such as cross-modal generation and retrieval. Previous multimodal approaches like CLIP utilize InfoNCE to maximize mutual information, primarily aligning pairwise samples across modalities while overlooking distributional differences. In addition, InfoNCE has inherent conflict in terms of alignment and uniformity in multimodality, leading to suboptimal alignment with modality gaps. To overcome the limitations, we propose CS-Aligner, a novel framework that performs distributional vision-language alignment by integrating Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence with mutual information. CS-Aligner captures both the global distribution information of each modality and the pairwise semantic relationships. We find that the CS divergence seamlessly addresses the InfoNCE's alignment-uniformity conflict and serves complementary roles with InfoNCE, yielding tighter and more precise alignment. Moreover, by introducing distributional alignment, CS-Aligner enables incorporating additional information from unpaired data and token-level representations, enhancing flexible and fine-grained alignment in practice. Experiments on text-to-image generation and cross-modality retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on vision-language alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hunyuan-Game: Industrial-grade Intelligent Game Creation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14135v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent game creation represents a transformative advancement in game development, utilizing generative artificial intelligence to dynamically generate and enhance game content. Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains a challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2) Game Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference image-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for characters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These image and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic expression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing a systematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Conjuring Positive Pairs for Efficient Unification of Representation Learning and Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15060v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While representation learning and generative modeling seek to understand visual data, unifying both domains remains unexplored. Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available in https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen) |
| **[Attentive Eraser: Unleashing Diffusion Model's Object Removal Potential via Self-Attention Redirection Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12974v5)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have emerged as promising newcomers in the field of generative models, shining brightly in image generation. However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

| **[UniGen: Enhanced Training & Test-Time Strategies for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14682v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce UniGen, a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of image understanding and generation. We study the full training pipeline of UniGen from a data-centric perspective, including multi-stage pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. More importantly, we propose a new Chain-of-Thought Verification (CoT-V) strategy for test-time scaling, which significantly boosts UniGen's image generation quality using a simple Best-of-N test-time strategy. Specifically, CoT-V enables UniGen to act as both image generator and verifier at test time, assessing the semantic alignment between a text prompt and its generated image in a step-by-step CoT manner. Trained entirely on open-source datasets across all stages, UniGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of image understanding and generation benchmarks, with a final score of 0.78 on GenEval and 85.19 on DPG-Bench. Through extensive ablation studies, our work provides actionable insights and addresses key challenges in the full life cycle of building unified MLLMs, contributing meaningful directions to the future research.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[Training-Free Watermarking for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14673v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent malicious misuse of visual generative models. However, existing generative watermarking methods are mainly designed for diffusion models while watermarking for autoregressive image generation models remains largely underexplored. We propose IndexMark, a training-free watermarking framework for autoregressive image generation models. IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary validation scheme to enhance robustness against cropping attacks. Experiments demonstrate that IndexMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and verification accuracy, and exhibits robustness against various perturbations, including cropping, noises, Gaussian blur, random erasing, color jittering, and JPEG compression.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StainDiffuser: MultiTask Dual Diffusion Model for Virtual Staining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11340v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is widely regarded as the standard in pathology for diagnosing diseases and tracking tumor recurrence. While H&E staining shows tissue structures, it lacks the ability to reveal specific proteins that are associated with disease severity and treatment response. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains use antibodies to highlight the expression of these proteins on their respective cell types, improving diagnostic accuracy, and assisting with drug selection for treatment. Despite their value, IHC stains require additional time and resources, limiting their utilization in some clinical settings. Recent advances in deep learning have positioned Image-to-Image (I2I) translation as a computational, cost-effective alternative for IHC. I2I generates high fidelity stain transformations digitally, potentially replacing manual staining in IHC. Diffusion models, the current state of the art in image generation and conditional tasks, are particularly well suited for virtual IHC due to their ability to produce high quality images and resilience to mode collapse. However, these models require extensive and diverse datasets (often millions of samples) to achieve a robust performance, a challenge in virtual staining applications where only thousands of samples are typically available. Inspired by the success of multitask deep learning models in scenarios with limited data, we introduce STAINDIFFUSER, a novel multitask diffusion architecture tailored to virtual staining that achieves convergence with smaller datasets. STAINDIFFUSER simultaneously trains two diffusion processes: (a) generating cell specific IHC stains from H&E images and (b) performing H&E based cell segmentation, utilizing coarse segmentation labels exclusively during training. STAINDIFFUSER generates high-quality virtual stains for two markers, outperforming over twenty I2I baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Latent Flow Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14513v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, the standard implementation for large language models (LLMs), typically consist of tens to hundreds of discrete layers. While more layers can lead to better performance, this approach has been challenged as far from efficient, especially given the superiority of continuous layers demonstrated by diffusion and flow-based models for image generation. We propose the Latent Flow Transformer (LFT), which replaces a block of layers with a single learned transport operator trained via flow matching, offering significant compression while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture. Additionally, we address the limitations of existing flow-based methods in \textit{preserving coupling} by introducing the Flow Walking (FW) algorithm. On the Pythia-410M model, LFT trained with flow matching compresses 6 of 24 layers and outperforms directly skipping 2 layers (KL Divergence of LM logits at 0.407 vs. 0.529), demonstrating the feasibility of this design. When trained with FW, LFT further distills 12 layers into one while reducing the KL to 0.736 surpassing that from skipping 3 layers (0.932), significantly narrowing the gap between autoregressive and flow-based generation paradigms.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, the potential of reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions, and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like super-resolution and image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IP-Prompter: Training-Free Theme-Specific Image Generation via Dynamic Visual Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15641v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stories and characters that captivate us as we grow up shape unique fantasy worlds, with images serving as the primary medium for visually experiencing these realms. Personalizing generative models through fine-tuning with theme-specific data has become a prevalent approach in text-to-image generation. However, unlike object customization, which focuses on learning specific objects, theme-specific generation encompasses diverse elements such as characters, scenes, and objects. Such diversity also introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively generate multi-character, multi-concept, and continuous theme-specific images (TSI). Moreover, fine-tuning approaches often come with significant computational overhead, time costs, and risks of overfitting. This paper explores a fundamental question: Can image generation models directly leverage images as contextual input, similarly to how large language models use text as context? To address this, we present IP-Prompter, a novel training-free TSI generation method. IP-Prompter introduces visual prompting, a mechanism that integrates reference images into generative models, allowing users to seamlessly specify the target theme without requiring additional training. To further enhance this process, we propose a Dynamic Visual Prompting (DVP) mechanism, which iteratively optimizes visual prompts to improve the accuracy and quality of generated images. Our approach enables diverse applications, including consistent story generation, character design, realistic character generation, and style-guided image generation.

Under the new paradigm of first pre-training on massive image-text pairs and then fine-tuning on task-specific data, VLM in the remote sensing domain has made significant progress. The resulting models benefit from the absorption of extensive general knowledge and demonstrate strong performance across a variety of remote sensing data analysis tasks. Moreover, they are capable of interacting with users in a conversational manner. In this paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with a timely and comprehensive review of the developments in VLM using the two-stage paradigm. Specifically, we first cover a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing: contrastive learning, visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image generation. For each category, we detail the commonly used network architecture and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a thorough review of existing works, examining foundation models and task-specific adaptation methods in contrastive-based VLM, architectural upgrades, training strategies and model capabilities in instruction-based VLM, as well as generative foundation models with their representative downstream applications. Third, we summarize datasets used for VLM pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, with an analysis of their construction methodologies (including image sources and caption generation) and key properties, such as scale and task adaptability. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions: cross-modal representation alignment, vague requirement comprehension, explanation-driven model reliability, continually scalable model capabilities, and large-scale datasets featuring richer modalities and greater challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> | None |

Many existing approaches rely on text prompts as editing guidance. However, these methods are constrained by the need for manual prompt crafting, which can be time-consuming, introduce irrelevant details, and significantly limit editing performance. In this work, we propose optimizing semantic embeddings guided by attribute classifiers to steer text-to-image models toward desired edits, without relying on text prompts or requiring any training or fine-tuning of the diffusion model. We utilize classifiers to learn precise semantic embeddings at the dataset level. The learned embeddings are theoretically justified as the optimal representation of attribute semantics, enabling disentangled and accurate edits. Experiments further demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of disentanglement and strong generalization across different domains of data.</p></details> |  | None |

These models are being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and 95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike previous work that jointly models the global hair structure and local curl patterns, we propose to disentangle them using a PCA-based strand representation in the frequency domain, thereby allowing more precise editing and output control. Specifically, we leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry textures into low- to high-frequency hair structures, termed guide textures and residual textures, respectively. These decomposed textures are later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common stages in the hair grooming process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the architecture design of Perm, and finally deploy the trained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further showcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as single-view hair reconstruction, hairstyle editing, and hair-conditioned image generation.

| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VTBench: Evaluating Visual Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13439v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have recently shown strong performance in image generation, where a critical component is the visual tokenizer (VT) that maps continuous pixel inputs to discrete token sequences. The quality of the VT largely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current discrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders (VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of details and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality, without isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core tasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and covers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess state-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of reconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior visual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining spatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded representations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted reconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text and object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image generation and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the role of visual tokenization. We release our benchmark and codebase publicly to support further research and call on the community to develop strong, general-purpose open-source VTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages excluding appendix</p></details> | None |

However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images. Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses, including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and producing strong log-likelihood bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow \textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}), accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance. For example, our proposed Swin-DiT-L achieves a 54%$\uparrow$ FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while requiring less computational. https://github.com/wujiafu007/Swin-DiT</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/wujiafu007/Swin-DiT) |

As a result, merging existing datasets has become a common strategy. However, the sets of attributes across datasets are often inconsistent, and their naive concatenation typically leads to block-wise missing conditions. This presents a significant challenge for conditional generative modeling when the multiple attributes are used jointly as conditions, thereby limiting the model's controllability and applicability. To address this issue, we propose a novel generative approach, Diffusion Model with Double Guidance, which enables precise conditional generation even when no training samples contain all conditions simultaneously. Our method maintains rigorous control over multiple conditions without requiring joint annotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in molecular and image generation tasks, where it outperforms existing baselines both in alignment with target conditional distributions and in controllability under missing condition settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.</p></details> | <details><summary>L.

Unlike previous works that employ an open-loop approach and pre-define prompts to generate new data using either a language model or human expertise, we develop an automated closed-loop system which involves two feedback mechanisms. The first mechanism uses feedback from a given supervised model and finds adversarial prompts that result in image generations that maximize the model loss. While these adversarial prompts result in diverse data informed by the model, they are not informed of the target distribution, which can be inefficient. Therefore, we introduce the second feedback mechanism that guides the generation process towards a certain target distribution. We call the method combining these two mechanisms Guided Adversarial Prompts. We perform our evaluations on different tasks, datasets and architectures, with different types of distribution shifts (spuriously correlated data, unseen domains) and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed feedback mechanisms compared to open-loop approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://adversarial-prompts.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |

Recently, the generative capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AIM Workshop 2024 at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |

In this work, we take a data-driven approach to address this question by analyzing interpretable, monosemantic features extracted from deep multimodal models. Specifically, we investigate CLIP, a prominent visual-language representation model trained on massive image-text pairs. Building on prior research in single-modal interpretability, we develop a set of multi-modal interpretability tools and measures designed to disentangle and analyze features learned from CLIP. Specifically, we introduce the Modality Dominance Score (MDS) to attribute each CLIP feature to a specific modality. We then map CLIP features into a more interpretable space, enabling us to categorize them into three distinct classes: vision features (single-modal), language features (single-modal), and visual-language features (cross-modal). Interestingly, this data-driven categorization closely aligns with human intuitive understandings of different modalities. We further show that this modality decomposition can benefit multiple downstream tasks, including reducing bias in gender detection, generating cross-modal adversarial examples, and enabling modal-specific feature control in text-to-image generation. These results indicate that large-scale multimodal models, when equipped with task-agnostic interpretability tools, can offer valuable insights into the relationships between different data modalities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DeLoRA: Decoupling Angles and Strength in Low-rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18225v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have recently gained significant popularity thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale pretrained models. These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness.

As an instance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with Normalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential computation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling can be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as GS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow model have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in image generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some blocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while others are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose the Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM is used to identify whether a TarFlow block is "simple" (converges in few iterations) or "tough" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate whether the initial value of the iteration is good. Experiments on four TarFlow models demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling efficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID), achieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in Img64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample quality.

An essential technique for improving the sample quality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale to obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided sampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100 to 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated high-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance, their effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In this work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from instability issues, and they even become slower than DDIM when the guidance scale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose DPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++ solves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding methods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further propose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by reducing the effective step size. Experiments show that DPM-Solver++ can generate high-quality samples within only 15 to 20 steps for guided sampling by pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Intelligence Research</p></details> | None |

Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in a few tasks, aspects, or modalities, and easily suffer from low consistency. In this paper, we argue that explicit, fine-grained aspect specification is the key to both generalizability and objectivity in automated evaluation. To do so, we introduce a hierarchical aspect taxonomy spanning 112 aspects that unifies evaluation across four representative settings - Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Building on this taxonomy, we create FRAbench, a benchmark comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k aspect-level labels obtained from a combination of human and LLM annotations. FRAbench provides the first large-scale, multi-modal resource for training and meta-evaluating fine-grained LMM judges. Leveraging FRAbench, we develop GenEval, a fine-grained evaluator generalizable across tasks and modalities. Experiments show that GenEval (i) attains high agreement with GPT-4o and expert annotators, (ii) transfers robustly to unseen tasks and modalities, and (iii) reveals systematic weaknesses of current LMMs on evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC).

How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior audio-to-image generation methods typically rely on general-purpose datasets and overlook geographic and environmental contexts, resulting in unrealistic images that are misaligned with real-world environmental settings. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel geo-contextual computational framework that explicitly integrates geographic knowledge into multimodal generative modeling. We construct two large-scale geo-contextual multimodal datasets, SoundingSVI and SonicUrban, pairing diverse soundscapes with real-world landscape images. We propose SounDiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based model that incorporates geo-contextual scene conditioning to synthesize geographically coherent landscape images. Furthermore, we propose a practically-informed geo-contextual evaluation framework, the Place Similarity Score (PSS), across element-, scene-, and human perception-levels to measure consistency between input soundscapes and generated landscape images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SounDiT outperforms existing baselines in both visual fidelity and geographic settings. Our work not only establishes foundational benchmarks for GeoS2L generation but also highlights the importance of incorporating geographic domain knowledge in advancing multimodal generative models, opening new directions at the intersection of generative AI, geography, urban planning, and environmental sciences.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |

Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data. Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Selftok: Discrete Visual Tokens of Autoregression, by Diffusion, and for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07538v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments. Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for steering the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR Workshop GMCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[UniCMs: A Unified Consistency Model For Efficient Multimodal Generation and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05415v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency models (CMs) have shown promise in the efficient generation of both image and text. This raises the natural question of whether we can learn a unified CM for efficient multimodal generation (e.g., text-to-image) and understanding (e.g., image-to-text). Intuitively, such a model could be acquired by applying the consistency distillation (CD) to existing unified multimodal models. However, the key challenge is establishing a unified denoising perspective for both image and text generation, which is essential for establishing the consistency mapping. To tackle this, at the representation level, we advocate for discrete tokens for both modalities to best preserve language modeling capabilities. Critically, instead of defining the text denoising trajectory via recent discrete diffusion language modeling principles, we specify it using the parallel decoding trace of an autoregressive language model, benefiting from the latter's superior performance in general text generation tasks. The denoising trajectory of image tokens adheres to standard discrete diffusion. We train our unified consistency models (UniCMs) on these combined multimodal trajectories simultaneously with a unified objective. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy to further improve the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation, UniCMs outperform SD3 on GenEval, Image Reward, and CLIP Score metrics, while requiring only approximately ${1}/{8}$ of the sampling time. Meanwhile, in image-to-text generation, UniCMs surpass Show-o on the MMMU benchmark while being $1.5 \times$ faster at long-sequence generating speed.

There are many such models which, given a prompt of a text, will generate an image which depicts said prompt. There are many image generation models, such as Latent Diffusion Models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Generative Adversarial Networks and many more. When generating images, these models can generate sensitive image data, which can be threatening to privacy or may violate copyright laws of private entities. Machine unlearning aims at removing the influence of specific data subsets from the trained models and in the case of image generation models, remove the influence of a concept such that the model is unable to generate said images of the concept when prompted. Conventional retraining of the model can take upto days, hence fast algorithms are the need of the hour. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to remove the influence of concepts in diffusion models through updating the gradients of the final layers of the text encoders. Using a weighted loss function, we utilize backpropagation in order to update the weights of the final layers of the Text Encoder componet of the Stable Diffusion Model, removing influence of the concept from the text-image embedding space, such that when prompted, the result is an image not containing the concept. The weighted loss function makes use of Textual Inversion and Low-Rank Adaptation.We perform our experiments on Latent Diffusion Models, namely the Stable Diffusion v2 model, with an average concept unlearning runtime of 50 seconds using 4-5 images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Is Artificial Intelligence Generated Image Detection a Solved Problem?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12335v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion models, has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising serious concerns about misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement. Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that, despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future research toward dependable and generalizable AIGI detection.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

However, model reuse across distinct modalities (e.g., text and vision) remains limited due to the difficulty of aligning internal representations. Existing methods require extensive paired training data or are constrained to specific domains. We introduce a semi-supervised approach for model alignment via conditional flow matching. The conditional flow between latent spaces of different modalities (e.g., text-to-image or biological-to-artificial neuronal activity) can be learned in two settings: ($1$) solving a (balanced or unbalanced) optimal transport problem with an inter-space bridge cost, and ($2$) performing memory-efficient alignment using labelled exemplars. Despite being constrained by the original models' capacity, our method--under both settings--matches downstream task performance of end-to-end trained models on object recognition and image generation tasks across MNIST, ImageNet, and \cite{majaj2015simple} datasets, particularly when labelled training data is scarce ($<20\%$). Our method provides a data-efficient solution for inter-modal model alignment with minimal supervision.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike diffusion architectures, autoregressive models can naturally incorporate arbitrary modalities into a single, unified token sequence--offering a concise solution for multi-conditional image generation tasks. In this work, we propose $\textbf{ContextAR}$, a flexible and effective framework for multi-conditional image generation. ContextAR embeds diverse conditions (e.g., canny edges, depth maps, poses) directly into the token sequence, preserving modality-specific semantics. To maintain spatial alignment while enhancing discrimination among different condition types, we introduce hybrid positional encodings that fuse Rotary Position Embedding with Learnable Positional Embedding. We design Conditional Context-aware Attention to reduces computational complexity while preserving effective intra-condition perception. Without any fine-tuning, ContextAR supports arbitrary combinations of conditions during inference time. Experimental results demonstrate the powerful controllability and versatility of our approach, and show that the competitive perpormance than diffusion-based multi-conditional control approaches the existing autoregressive baseline across diverse multi-condition driven scenarios.

Unlike image generation, video generation requires a substantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames, resulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key observations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference latency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{FastCar} framework to accelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the temporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to determine whether to apply the replay strategy (\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached MLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with detailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware accelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to enable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional sparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher energy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse attention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with alleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution and long-duration video generation.

| **[Differentially Private Synthetic Data via APIs 3: Using Simulators Instead of Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05505v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private (DP) synthetic data, which closely resembles the original private data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, has become a key tool for unlocking the value of private data without compromising privacy. Recently, Private Evolution (PE) has emerged as a promising method for generating DP synthetic data. Unlike other training-based approaches, PE only requires access to inference APIs from foundation models, enabling it to harness the power of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models. However, a suitable foundation model for a specific private data domain is not always available. In this paper, we discover that the PE framework is sufficiently general to allow APIs beyond foundation models. In particular, we demonstrate that many SoTA data synthesizers that do not rely on neural networks--such as computer graphics-based image generators, which we refer to as simulators--can be effectively integrated into PE. This insight significantly broadens PE's applicability and unlocks the potential of powerful simulators for DP data synthesis. We explore this approach, named Sim-PE, in the context of image synthesis. Across four diverse simulators, Sim-PE performs well, improving the downstream classification accuracy of PE by up to 3x, reducing FID by up to 80%, and offering much greater efficiency. We also show that simulators and foundation models can be easily leveraged together within PE to achieve further improvements. The code is open-sourced in the Private Evolution Python library: https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA) |

Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.81 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.96 through inference scaling with VILA-Judge, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible.

However, existing models may fail to produce appropriate images for the cultural concepts or objects that are not well known or underrepresented in western cultures, such as `hangari' (Korean utensil). In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Culturally-Aware Text-to-Image Generation with Iterative Prompt Refinement (Culture-TRIP), which refines the prompt in order to improve the alignment of the image with such culture nouns in text-to-image models. Our approach (1) retrieves cultural contexts and visual details related to the culture nouns in the prompt and (2) iteratively refines and evaluates the prompt based on a set of cultural criteria and large language models. The refinement process utilizes the information retrieved from Wikipedia and the Web. Our user survey, conducted with 66 participants from eight different countries demonstrates that our proposed approach enhances the alignment between the images and the prompts. In particular, C-TRIP demonstrates improved alignment between the generated images and underrepresented culture nouns.

However, training diffusion models typically requires clean ground-truth images, which are unavailable in many applications. We introduce the Measurement Score-based diffusion Model (MSM), a novel framework that learns partial measurement scores using only noisy and subsampled measurements. MSM models the distribution of full measurements as an expectation over partial scores induced by randomized subsampling. To make the MSM representation computationally efficient, we also develop a stochastic sampling algorithm that generates full images by using a randomly selected subset of partial scores at each step. We additionally propose a new posterior sampling method for solving inverse problems that reconstructs images using these partial scores. We provide a theoretical analysis that bounds the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions induced by full and stochastic sampling, establishing the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MSM on natural images and multi-coil MRI, showing that it can generate high-quality images and solve inverse problems -- all without access to clean training data.

Oftentimes, synthetic datasets do not faithfully recreate the data distribution of real data, i.e., they lack the fidelity or diversity needed for effective downstream model training. While previous work has employed few-shot guidance to address this issue, existing methods still fail to capture and generate features unique to specific real images. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset generation framework named LoFT, LoRA-Fused Training-data Generation with Few-shot Guidance. Our method fine-tunes LoRA weights on individual real images and fuses them at inference time, producing synthetic images that combine the features of real images for improved diversity and fidelity of generated data. We evaluate the synthetic data produced by LoFT on 10 datasets, using 8 to 64 real images per class as guidance and scaling up to 1000 images per class. Our experiments show that training on LoFT-generated data consistently outperforms other synthetic dataset methods, significantly increasing accuracy as the dataset size increases. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that LoFT generates datasets with high fidelity and sufficient diversity, which contribute to the performance improvement.

However, existing multi-layer generation methods fail to handle the interactions among multiple layers such as rational global layout, physics-plausible contacts and visual effects like shadows and reflections while maintaining high alpha quality. To solve this problem, we propose PSDiffusion, a unified diffusion framework for simultaneous multi-layer text-to-image generation. Our model can automatically generate multi-layer images with one RGB background and multiple RGBA foregrounds through a single feed-forward process. Unlike existing methods that combine multiple tools for post-decomposition or generate layers sequentially and separately, our method introduces a global-layer interactive mechanism that generates layered-images concurrently and collaboratively, ensuring not only high quality and completeness for each layer, but also spatial and visual interactions among layers for global coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/dingbang777/PSDiffusion/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/dingbang777/PSDiffusion) |

While these models are often employed for legitimate purposes, they are also used to generate fake images that support misinformation and hate speech. Consequently, it is crucial to develop robust tools capable of detecting whether an image has been generated by such models. Many current detection methods, however, require large volumes of sample images for training. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the field, existing datasets often cover only a limited range of models and quickly become outdated. In this work, we introduce DRAGON, a comprehensive dataset comprising images from 25 diffusion models, spanning both recent advancements and older, well-established architectures. The dataset contains a broad variety of images representing diverse subjects. To enhance image realism, we propose a simple yet effective pipeline that leverages a large language model to expand input prompts, thereby generating more diverse and higher-quality outputs, as evidenced by improvements in standard quality metrics. The dataset is provided in multiple sizes (ranging from extra-small to extra-large) to accomodate different research scenarios. DRAGON is designed to support the forensic community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for synthetic content. Additionally, the dataset is accompanied by a dedicated test set, intended to serve as a benchmark for assessing the performance of newly developed methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Numerous methods have been proposed to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models, achieving notable improvements in aligning generated outputs with human preferences. However, we argue that existing preference alignment methods neglect the critical role of handling unconditional/negative-conditional outputs, leading to a diminished capacity to avoid generating undesirable outcomes. This oversight limits the efficacy of classifier-free guidance~(CFG), which relies on the contrast between conditional generation and unconditional/negative-conditional generation to optimize output quality. In response, we propose a straightforward but versatile effective approach that involves training a model specifically attuned to negative preferences. This method does not require new training strategies or datasets but rather involves minor modifications to existing techniques. Our approach integrates seamlessly with models such as SD1.5, SDXL, video diffusion models and models that have undergone preference optimization, consistently enhancing their alignment with human preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Still, high-resolution image synthesis presents formidable challenges due to the scarcity and complexity of high-resolution content. Recent approaches have investigated training-free strategies to enable high-resolution image synthesis with pre-trained models. However, these techniques often struggle with generating high-quality visuals and tend to exhibit artifacts or low-fidelity details, as they typically rely solely on the endpoint of the low-resolution sampling trajectory while neglecting intermediate states that are critical for preserving structure and synthesizing finer detail. To this end, we present HiFlow, a training-free and model-agnostic framework to unlock the resolution potential of pre-trained flow models. Specifically, HiFlow establishes a virtual reference flow within the high-resolution space that effectively captures the characteristics of low-resolution flow information, offering guidance for high-resolution generation through three key aspects: initialization alignment for low-frequency consistency, direction alignment for structure preservation, and acceleration alignment for detail fidelity. By leveraging such flow-aligned guidance, HiFlow substantially elevates the quality of high-resolution image synthesis of T2I models and demonstrates versatility across their personalized variants. Extensive experiments validate HiFlow's capability in achieving superior high-resolution image quality over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bujiazi.github.io/hiflow.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://bujiazi.github.io/hiflow.github.io) |

However, they still struggle with accurately depicting compositional scenes that specify multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relations. We present CompAlign, a challenging benchmark with an emphasis on assessing the depiction of 3D-spatial relationships, for evaluating and improving models on compositional image generation. CompAlign consists of 900 complex multi-subject image generation prompts that combine numerical and 3D-spatial relationships with varied attribute bindings. Our benchmark is remarkably challenging, incorporating generation tasks with 3+ generation subjects with complex 3D-spatial relationships. Additionally, we propose CompQuest, an interpretable and accurate evaluation framework that decomposes complex prompts into atomic sub-questions, then utilizes a MLLM to provide fine-grained binary feedback on the correctness of each aspect of generation elements in model-generated images. This enables precise quantification of alignment between generated images and compositional prompts. Furthermore, we propose an alignment framework that uses CompQuest's feedback as preference signals to improve diffusion models' compositional image generation abilities. Using adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and flexible for different tasks. Evaluation of 9 T2I models reveals that: (1) models remarkable struggle more with compositional tasks with more complex 3D-spatial configurations, and (2) a noticeable performance gap exists between open-source accessible models and closed-source commercial models. Further empirical study on using CompAlign for model alignment yield promising results: post-alignment diffusion models achieve remarkable improvements in compositional accuracy, especially on complex generation tasks, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure (efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts. Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off between efficacy and usability.

While maintaining the computational efficiency of Visual Mamba, we introduce a strip-based scanning scheme to effectively reduce artifacts from global unidirectional scanning. Additionally, HSRMamba uses wavelet decomposition to alleviate modal conflicts between high-frequency spatial features and low-frequency spectral features, further improving super-resolution performance. Extensive experiments show that HSRMamba not only excels in reducing computational load and model size but also outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

This often leads to catastrophic forgetting, overfitting, or large computational overhead.We propose a two-stage pipeline that addresses these limitations by leveraging LoRA-based fine-tuning on the attention weights within the U-Net of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model. First, we use the unmodified SDXL to generate a generic scene by replacing the subject with its class label. Then, we selectively insert the personalized subject through a segmentation-driven image-to-image (Img2Img) pipeline that uses the trained LoRA weights.This framework isolates the subject encoding from the overall composition, thus preserving SDXL's broader generative capabilities while integrating the new subject in a high-fidelity manner. Our method achieves a DINO similarity score of 0.789 on SDXL, outperforming existing personalized text-to-image approaches.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

For Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles overfitting of controllers to simulation conditions fundamentally leads to poor performance in the operation environment. There is a pressing need for more diverse and realistic test data that accurately represents the challenges faced by these systems. We address the challenge of generating perception test data for autonomous systems by leveraging Neural Radiance Fields to generate realistic and diverse test images, and integrating them into a metamorphic testing framework for vision components such as vSLAM and object detection. Our tool, N2R-Tester, allows training models of custom scenes and rendering test images from perturbed positions. An experimental evaluation of N2R-Tester on eight different vision components in AUVs and UAVs demonstrates the efficacy and versatility of the approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[End-to-End Vision Tokenizer Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10562v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics. This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives. ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite rapid advancements in generative AI for real-world imagery, medical domain evaluations have been hindered by methodological inconsistencies, outdated architectural comparisons, and disconnected assessment criteria that rarely address the practical clinical value of synthetic samples. CheXGenBench overcomes these limitations through standardised data partitioning and a unified evaluation protocol comprising over 20 quantitative metrics that systematically analyse generation quality, potential privacy vulnerabilities, and downstream clinical applicability across 11 leading text-to-image architectures. Our results reveal critical inefficiencies in the existing evaluation protocols, particularly in assessing generative fidelity, leading to inconsistent and uninformative comparisons. Our framework establishes a standardised benchmark for the medical AI community, enabling objective and reproducible comparisons while facilitating seamless integration of both existing and future generative models. Additionally, we release a high-quality, synthetic dataset, SynthCheX-75K, comprising 75K radiographs generated by the top-performing model (Sana 0.6B) in our benchmark to support further research in this critical domain. Through CheXGenBench, we establish a new state-of-the-art and release our framework, models, and SynthCheX-75K dataset at https://raman1121.github.io/CheXGenBench/</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://raman1121.github.io/CheXGenBench) |

These models refine images from random noise based on textual prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD (Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents, each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation tasks.

Directly transferring extracted style features to natural images often results in outputs with obvious synthetic traces. This is because key painting attributes including layout, perspective, shape, and semantics often cannot be conveyed and expressed through style transfer. Large-scale pretrained text-to-image generation models have demonstrated their capability to synthesize a vast amount of high-quality images. However, even with extensive textual descriptions, it is challenging to fully express the unique visual properties and details of paintings. Moreover, generic models often disrupt the overall artistic effect when modifying specific areas, making it more complicated to achieve a unified aesthetic in artworks. Our main novel idea is to integrate multimodal semantic information as a synthesis guide into artworks, rather than transferring style to the real world. We also aim to reduce the disruption to the harmony of artworks while simplifying the guidance conditions. Specifically, we propose an innovative multi-task unified framework called CreativeSynth, based on the diffusion model with the ability to coordinate multimodal inputs. CreativeSynth combines multimodal features with customized attention mechanisms to seamlessly integrate real-world semantic content into the art domain through Cross-Art-Attention for aesthetic maintenance and semantic fusion. We demonstrate the results of our method across a wide range of different art categories, proving that CreativeSynth bridges the gap between generative models and artistic expression.

Previous studies mainly focused on overall system performance rather than detailed comparisons with alternative methods, and key design details and training recipes were often left undisclosed. These gaps create uncertainty about the real potential of this approach. To fill these gaps, we conduct an empirical study on text-to-image generation, performing controlled comparisons with established baselines, analyzing important design choices, and providing a clear, reproducible recipe for training at scale. We hope this work offers meaningful data points and practical guidelines for future research in multi-modal generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for video streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video streaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in real-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient acceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus.

Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose EnerVerse-AC (EVAC), an action-conditional world model that generates future visual observations based on an agent's predicted actions, enabling realistic and controllable robotic inference. Building on prior architectures, EVAC introduces a multi-level action-conditioning mechanism and ray map encoding for dynamic multi-view image generation while expanding training data with diverse failure trajectories to improve generalization. As both a data engine and evaluator, EVAC augments human-collected trajectories into diverse datasets and generates realistic, action-conditioned video observations for policy testing, eliminating the need for physical robots or complex simulations. This approach significantly reduces costs while maintaining high fidelity in robotic manipulation evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.

Nevertheless, the challenge of editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE (Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing) - a novel technique leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and secures second and third places in the remaining three.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, code available at https://guillermogotre.github.io/sage/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://guillermogotre.github.io/sage) |

Although design choices for image understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies. Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes, objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design, training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks. To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code, model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Train a Multi-Task Diffusion Policy on RLBench-18 in One Day with One GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09430v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for training multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion policies that reduces training time and memory usage by an order of magnitude. This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: image generation targets are high-dimensional, while robot actions lie in a much lower-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the vision-language conditions for action generation remain high-dimensional. Our approach, Mini-Diffuser, exploits this asymmetry by introducing Level-2 minibatching, which pairs multiple noised action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and 7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on diverse perceptual inputs.

In data-scarce settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and intrinsic decomposition.

However, TTI models are trained to always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate what we call "default images": images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. We argue studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for TTI and prompt engineering. In this paper, we provide the first investigation into default images on Midjourney, a popular image generator. We describe our systematic approach to create input prompts triggering default images, and present the results of our initial experiments and several small-scale ablation studies. We also report on a survey study investigating how default images affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI and highlights challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |

We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text-to-image models through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems--including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants--demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI-driven content generation.</p></details> |  | None |

This capability is non-trivial for real-world applications like graphic design, where clear visual hierarchy between content and text is essential. Prior work has primarily focused on arranging layouts within existing static images, leaving unexplored the potential of T2I models for generating text-friendly backgrounds. We present TextCenGen, a training-free dynamic background adaptation in the blank region for text-friendly image generation. Instead of directly reducing attention in text areas, which degrades image quality, we relocate conflicting objects before background optimization. Our method analyzes cross-attention maps to identify conflicting objects overlapping with text regions and uses a force-directed graph approach to guide their relocation, followed by attention excluding constraints to ensure smooth backgrounds. Our method is plug-and-play, requiring no additional training while well balancing both semantic fidelity and visual quality. Evaluated on our proposed text-friendly T2I benchmark of 27,000 images across four seed datasets, TextCenGen outperforms existing methods by achieving 23% lower saliency overlap in text regions while maintaining 98% of the semantic fidelity measured by CLIP score and our proposed Visual-Textual Concordance Metric (VTCM).</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, crafting effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts, VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

Here, we introduce an image centric, closed-loop framework that makes microstructural morphology into a controllable objective and demonstrate its use case with Li- and Mn-rich layered oxide cathode precursors. This work presents an integrated, AI driven framework for the predictive design and optimization of lithium-ion battery cathode precursor synthesis. This framework integrates a diffusion-based image generation model, a quantitative image analysis pipeline, and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. By extracting key morphological descriptors such as texture, sphericity, and median particle size (D50) from SEM images, the platform accurately predicts SEM like morphologies resulting from specific coprecipitation conditions, including reaction time-, solution concentration-, and pH-dependent structural changes. Optimization then pinpoints synthesis parameters that yield user defined target morphologies, as experimentally validated by the close agreement between predicted and synthesized structures. This framework offers a practical strategy for data driven materials design, enabling both forward prediction and inverse design of synthesis conditions and paving the way toward autonomous, image guided microstructure engineering.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Discrete Visual Tokens of Autoregression, by Diffusion, and for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07538v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.

In this context, it is useful to interpolate between latents produced by inverting a set of input images, in order to generate new images representing some mixture of the inputs. We observe that such interpolation can easily lead to degenerate results when the number of inputs is large. We analyze the cause of this effect theoretically and experimentally, and suggest a suitable remedy. The suggested approach is a relatively simple normalization scheme that is easy to use whenever interpolation between latents is needed. We measure image quality using FID and CLIP embedding distance and show experimentally that baseline interpolation methods lead to a drop in quality metrics long before the degeneration issue is clearly visible. In contrast, our method significantly reduces the degeneration effect and leads to improved quality metrics also in non-degenerate situations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures | None |

However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 | None |

Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation, outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative image dataset are available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SerialGen: Personalized Image Generation by First Standardization Then Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01485v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we are interested in achieving both high text controllability and whole-body appearance consistency in the generation of personalized human characters. We propose a novel framework, named SerialGen, which is a serial generation method consisting of two stages: first, a standardization stage that standardizes reference images, and then a personalized generation stage based on the standardized reference. Furthermore, we introduce two modules aimed at enhancing the standardization process. Our experimental results validate the proposed framework's ability to produce personalized images that faithfully recover the reference image's whole-body appearance while accurately responding to a wide range of text prompts. Through thorough analysis, we highlight the critical contribution of the proposed serial generation method and standardization model, evidencing enhancements in appearance consistency between reference and output images and across serial outputs generated from diverse text prompts. The term "Serial" in this work carries a double meaning: it refers to the two-stage method and also underlines our ability to generate serial images with consistent appearance throughout.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DiffGAN: A Test Generation Approach for Differential Testing of Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19794v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across applications. However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Metrics that matter: Evaluating image quality metrics for medical image generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07175v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating generative models for synthetic medical imaging is crucial yet challenging, especially given the high standards of fidelity, anatomical accuracy, and safety required for clinical applications. Standard evaluation of generated images often relies on no-reference image quality metrics when ground truth images are unavailable, but their reliability in this complex domain is not well established. This study comprehensively assesses commonly used no-reference image quality metrics using brain MRI data, including tumour and vascular images, providing a representative exemplar for the field. We systematically evaluate metric sensitivity to a range of challenges, including noise, distribution shifts, and, critically, localised morphological alterations designed to mimic clinically relevant inaccuracies. We then compare these metric scores against model performance on a relevant downstream segmentation task, analysing results across both controlled image perturbations and outputs from different generative model architectures. Our findings reveal significant limitations: many widely-used no-reference image quality metrics correlate poorly with downstream task suitability and exhibit a profound insensitivity to localised anatomical details crucial for clinical validity. Furthermore, these metrics can yield misleading scores regarding distribution shifts, e.g. data memorisation. This reveals the risk of misjudging model readiness, potentially leading to the deployment of flawed tools that could compromise patient safety. We conclude that ensuring generative models are truly fit for clinical purpose requires a multifaceted validation framework, integrating performance on relevant downstream tasks with the cautious interpretation of carefully selected no-reference image quality metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model \cite{Baqu2019SethiR}. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE \cite{empriseem_ai_images}. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces KDC-Diff, a novel stable diffusion framework that enhances efficiency while maintaining image quality. KDC-Diff features a streamlined U-Net architecture with nearly half the parameters of the original U-Net (482M), significantly reducing model complexity. We propose a dual-layered distillation strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation, transferring semantic and structural insights from a teacher to a compact student model while minimizing quality degradation. Additionally, replay-based continual learning is integrated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, allowing the model to retain prior knowledge while adapting to new data. Despite operating under extremely low computational resources, KDC-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Oxford Flowers and Butterflies & Moths 100 Species datasets, demonstrating competitive metrics such as FID, CLIP, and LPIPS. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference time compared to existing models. These results establish KDC-Diff as a highly efficient and adaptable solution for text-to-image generation, particularly in computationally constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BihoT: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Hyperspectral Camouflaged Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12232v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral object tracking (HOT) has exhibited potential in various applications, particularly in scenes where objects are camouflaged. Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[ForgetMe: Evaluating Selective Forgetting in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12574v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffuser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06761v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-image synthesis, demonstrating impressive text comprehension and zero-shot generalization. These models refine images from random noise based on textual prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD (Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents, each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation tasks.

Yet, existing methods often fail to reconcile high-level semantic fidelity with explicit spatial control, particularly in scenes involving multiple objects, nuanced relations, or complex layouts. To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Alignment (HCMA) framework for grounded text-to-image generation. HCMA integrates two alignment modules into each diffusion sampling step: a global module that continuously aligns latent representations with textual descriptions to ensure scene-level coherence, and a local module that employs bounding-box layouts to anchor objects at specified locations, enabling fine-grained spatial control. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO 2014 validation set show that HCMA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 0.69 improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and a 0.0295 gain in CLIP Score. These results demonstrate HCMA's effectiveness in faithfully capturing intricate textual semantics while adhering to user-defined spatial constraints, offering a robust solution for semantically grounded image generation.Our code is available at https://github.com/hwang-cs-ime/HCMA</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/hwang-cs-ime/HCMA) |

However, efficiently serving these models is challenging due to their computation-intensive nature and the variation in query demands. In this paper, we aim to address both problems simultaneously through query-aware model scaling. The core idea is to construct model cascades so that easy queries can be processed by more lightweight diffusion models without compromising image generation quality. Based on this concept, we develop an end-to-end text-to-image diffusion model serving system, DiffServe, which automatically constructs model cascades from available diffusion model variants and allocates resources dynamically in response to demand fluctuations. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that DiffServe achieves up to 24% improvement in response quality while maintaining 19-70% lower latency violation rates compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, the scarcity of rich defect data poses substantial challenges for effective model training. While existing methods have explored generative models to augment datasets, they often suffer from instability, limited diversity, and domain shifts. To address these issues, we propose PDIG, a Photovoltaic Defect Image Generator based on Stable Diffusion (SD). PDIG leverages the strong priors learned from large-scale datasets to enhance generation quality under limited data. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic Concept Embedding (SCE) module that incorporates text-conditioned priors to capture the relational concepts between defect types and their appearances. To further enrich the domain distribution, we design a Lightweight Industrial Style Adaptor (LISA), which injects industrial defect characteristics into the SD model through cross-disentangled attention. At inference, we propose a Text-Image Dual-Space Constraints (TIDSC) module, enforcing the quality of generated images via positional consistency and spatial smoothing alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDIG achieves superior realism and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our approach improves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 19.16 points over the second-best method and significantly enhances the performance of downstream defect detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

Nonetheless, the iterative nature of diffusion models (DMs) results in high computation complexity, posing challenges for deployment. Although existing cache-based acceleration methods try to utilize the inherent temporal similarity to skip redundant computations of DiT, the lack of correction may induce potential quality degradation. In this paper, we propose increment-calibrated caching, a training-free method for DiT acceleration, where the calibration parameters are generated from the pre-trained model itself with low-rank approximation. To deal with the possible correction failure arising from outlier activations, we introduce channel-aware Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which further strengthens the calibration effect. Experimental results show that our method always achieve better performance than existing naive caching methods with a similar computation resource budget. When compared with 35-step DDIM, our method eliminates more than 45% computation and improves IS by 12 at the cost of less than 0.06 FID increase.

Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the image restoration community. We present the first systematic evaluation of GPT-4o across diverse restoration tasks. Our experiments reveal that, although restoration outputs from GPT-4o are visually appealing, they often suffer from pixel-level structural fidelity when compared to ground-truth images. Common issues are variations in image proportions, shifts in object positions and quantities, and changes in viewpoint.To address it, taking image dehazing, derainning, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show that GPT-4o's outputs can serve as powerful visual priors, substantially enhancing the performance of existing dehazing networks. It offers practical guidelines and a baseline framework to facilitate the integration of GPT-4o into future image restoration pipelines. We hope the study on GPT-4o image restoration will accelerate innovation in the broader field of image generation areas. To support further research, we will release GPT-4o-restored images from over 10 widely used image restoration datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mogao...</summary><p>Mogao Technical Report</p></details> | None |

Our method employs a Schroedinger bridge to transform the noisy speech distribution into the clean speech distribution. To stabilize and improve training, we employ time-dependent scalings of the inputs and outputs of the network, known as preconditioning. We consider two skip connection configurations, which either include or omit the current process state in the denoiser's output, enabling the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. Each approach leads to improved performance on different speech enhancement metrics. To maintain stable magnitude levels and balance during training, we use a magnitude-preserving network architecture that normalizes all activations and network weights to unit length. Additionally, we propose learning the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for effective input conditioning. After training, we apply a method to approximate different exponential moving average (EMA) profiles and investigate their effects on the speech enhancement performance. In contrast to image generation tasks, where longer EMA lengths often enhance mode coverage, we observe that shorter EMA lengths consistently lead to better performance on standard speech enhancement metrics.

Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity information and background information. As a result, the generated images not only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+ space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space, which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild images of the pre-trained model during inference. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in this task.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures | None |

Although some pioneering methods have achieved automatic text-to-3D generation, they are generally limited to small-scale scenes with restricted control over the shape and texture. We introduce SceneCraft, a novel method for generating detailed indoor scenes that adhere to textual descriptions and spatial layout preferences provided by users. Central to our method is a rendering-based technique, which converts 3D semantic layouts into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Without the constraints of panorama image generation, we surpass previous methods in supporting complicated indoor space generation beyond a single room, even as complicated as a whole multi-bedroom apartment with irregular shapes and layouts.

Training these models demands significantly larger datasets and computational resources compared to text-only LLMs. To address the scaling challenges, we introduce Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture that significantly reduces pretraining computational costs. MoT decouples non-embedding parameters of the model by modality -- including feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization -- enabling modality-specific processing with global self-attention over the full input sequence. We evaluate MoT across multiple settings and model scales. In the Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT matches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8\% of the FLOPs. When extended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the dense baseline with only 37.2\% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where text and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches the image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the FLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image generation metrics. System profiling further highlights MoT's practical benefits, achieving dense baseline image quality in 47.2\% of the wall-clock time and text quality in 75.6\% of the wall-clock time (measured on AWS p4de.24xlarge instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025; 48 pages</p></details> | None |

This is due to the content of existing large training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is arxiv version of the paper which was accepted for the Doklady Mathematics Journal in 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[On Synthetic Texture Datasets: Challenges, Creation, and Curation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10297v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of textures on machine learning models has been an ongoing investigation, specifically in texture bias/learning, interpretability, and robustness. However, due to the lack of large and diverse texture data available, the findings in these works have been limited, as more comprehensive evaluations have not been feasible. Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 362,880 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data. Through both standard metrics and a human evaluation, we find that our dataset is high quality and diverse. Our dataset is available for download at https://zenodo.org/records/15359142.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior scene layout generation methods are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn in image editing applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficiency Meets Fidelity: A Novel Quantization Framework for Stable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06661v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation via Stable Diffusion models (SDM) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their computational intensity, particularly in the iterative denoising process, hinders real-time deployment in latency-sensitive applications. While Recent studies have explored post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods to compress Diffusion models, existing methods often overlook the consistency between results generated by quantized models and those from floating-point models. This consistency is paramount for professional applications where both efficiency and output reliability are essential. To ensure that quantized SDM generates high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficient quantization framework for SDM. Our framework introduces a Serial-to-Parallel pipeline that simultaneously maintains training-inference consistency and ensures optimization stability. Building upon this foundation, we further develop several techniques including multi-timestep activation quantization, time information precalculation, inter-layer distillation, and selective freezing, to achieve high-fidelity generation in comparison to floating-point models while maintaining quantization efficiency. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple Stable Diffusion variants (v1-4, v2-1, XL 1.0, and v3), our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches with shorter training times. Under W4A8 quantization settings, we achieve significant improvements in both distribution similarity and visual fidelity, while preserving a high image quality.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Efficient Flow Matching using Latent Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04486v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. Building upon the ideas of continuous normalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the diffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data. Most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present \texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that \texttt{Latent-CFM} exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training ($\sim 50\%$ less in some cases) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-Free Sketch-Guided Diffusion with Latent Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00313v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Based on recent advanced diffusion models, Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated their capabilities to generate diverse and high-quality images. However, leveraging their potential for real-world content creation, particularly in providing users with precise control over the image generation result, poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an innovative training-free pipeline that extends existing text-to-image generation models to incorporate a sketch as an additional condition. To generate new images with a layout and structure closely resembling the input sketch, we find that these core features of a sketch can be tracked with the cross-attention maps of diffusion models. We introduce latent optimization, a method that refines the noisy latent at each intermediate step of the generation process using cross-attention maps to ensure that the generated images adhere closely to the desired structure outlined in the reference sketch. Through latent optimization, our method enhances the accuracy of image generation, offering users greater control and customization options in content creation.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures. We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation. Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging. All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers. UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors. Warning: This paper includes visual examples of adversarial inputs designed to test model safety.

In this paper, we investigate the use of self-training in language agents, which can generate supervision from the agent itself, offering a promising alternative without relying on human or stronger model demonstrations. Self-training, however, requires high-quality model-generated samples, which are hard to obtain for challenging language agent tasks. To address this, we present Reflection-Reinforced Self-Training (Re-ReST), which uses a \textit{reflector} to refine low-quality generated samples during self-training. The reflector takes the agent's output and feedback from an external environment (e.g., unit test results in code generation) to produce improved samples. This technique enhances the quality of inferior samples and efficiently enriches the self-training dataset with higher-quality samples. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source language agents across tasks, including multi-hop question answering, sequential decision-making, code generation, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-training and Re-ReST in language agent tasks, with self-training improving baselines by 7.6\% on HotpotQA and 28.4\% on AlfWorld, and Re-ReST further boosting performance by 2.0\% and 14.1\%, respectively. Our studies also confirm the efficiency of using a reflector to generate high-quality samples for self-training. Moreover, we demonstrate a method to employ reflection during inference without ground-truth feedback, addressing the limitation of previous reflection work.

Recent research has demonstrated that Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS) exhibits significant practical advantages, as it enables stable and efficient steganographic embedding and extraction without requiring neural network training. However, the stego image generated by existing FNNS methods suffers from considerable distortion and exhibits poor robustness, severely reducing the security and practicality of steganography. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography (RFNNS). In RFNNS, we introduce a texture-aware localization technique to add perturbations carrying secret image information to complex texture areas that are less perceptible to the human eye, thereby ensuring the quality of the stego image. To enhance robustness, a robust steganographic perturbation generation (RSPG) strategy is designed, which enables slight perturbations to be accurately decoded even after common image attacks. Subsequently, the generated robust perturbations are combined with the AI-generated cover image to produce the stego image. The receiver only needs to share the secret key and employ the same decoding network structure to accurately extract the secret image from the attacked stego image. Experimental results demonstrate that RFNNS achieves enhanced performance in terms of security, including imperceptibility and anti-steganalysis performance. Furthermore, RFNNS demonstrates superior robustness against common image attacks, such as JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and contrast adjustment, across diverse embedding capacities, outperforming existing SOTA FNNS methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DynamicControl: Adaptive Condition Selection for Improved Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03255v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.</p></details> |  | None |

A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands.

It demonstrates a very remarkable generation capability with excellent multimodal condition understanding and varied task instructions. In this paper, we aim to explore the capabilities of GPT-4o across various tasks. Inspired by previous study, we constructed a task taxonomy along with a carefully curated set of test samples to conduct a comprehensive qualitative test. Benefiting from GPT-4o's powerful multimodal comprehension, its image-generation process demonstrates abilities surpassing those of traditional image-generation tasks. Thus, regarding the dimensions of model capabilities, we evaluate its performance across six task categories: traditional image generation tasks, discriminative tasks, knowledge-based generation, commonsense-based generation, spatially-aware image generation, and temporally-aware image generation. These tasks not only assess the quality and conditional alignment of the model's outputs but also probe deeper into GPT-4o's understanding of real-world concepts. Our results reveal that GPT-4o performs impressively well in general-purpose synthesis tasks, showing strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, visual stylization, and low-level image processing. However, significant limitations remain in its ability to perform precise spatial reasoning, instruction-grounded generation, and consistent temporal prediction. Furthermore, when faced with knowledge-intensive or domain-specific scenarios, such as scientific illustrations or mathematical plots, the model often exhibits hallucinations, factual errors, or structural inconsistencies. These findings suggest that while GPT-4o marks a substantial advancement in unified multimodal generation, there is still a long way to go before it can be reliably applied to professional or safety-critical domains.</p></details> |  | None |

However, T2I models introduce risks such as the generation of non-consensual depictions of identifiable individuals, otherwise known as deepfakes. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the accessibility of deepfake model variants online. Through a metadata analysis of thousands of publicly downloadable model variants on two popular repositories, Hugging Face and Civitai, we demonstrate a huge rise in easily accessible deepfake models. Almost 35,000 examples of publicly downloadable deepfake model variants are identified, primarily hosted on Civitai. These deepfake models have been downloaded almost 15 million times since November 2022, with the models targeting a range of individuals from global celebrities to Instagram users with under 10,000 followers. Both Stable Diffusion and Flux models are used for the creation of deepfake models, with 96% of these targeting women and many signalling intent to generate non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Deepfake model variants are often created via the parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as low rank adaptation (LoRA), requiring as few as 20 images, 24GB VRAM, and 15 minutes of time, making this process widely accessible via consumer-grade computers. Despite these models violating the Terms of Service of hosting platforms, and regulation seeking to prevent dissemination, these results emphasise the pressing need for greater action to be taken against the creation of deepfakes and NCII.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

However, given a long paragraph (up to 512 words), these generation models still struggle to achieve strong alignment and are unable to generate images depicting complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce an information-enriched diffusion model for paragraph-to-image generation task, termed ParaDiffusion, which delves into the transference of the extensive semantic comprehension capabilities of large language models to the task of image generation. At its core is using a large language model (e.g., Llama V2) to encode long-form text, followed by fine-tuning with LORA to alignthe text-image feature spaces in the generation task. To facilitate the training of long-text semantic alignment, we also curated a high-quality paragraph-image pair dataset, namely ParaImage. This dataset contains a small amount of high-quality, meticulously annotated data, and a large-scale synthetic dataset with long text descriptions being generated using a vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate that ParaDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art models (SD XL, DeepFloyd IF) on ViLG-300 and ParaPrompts, achieving up to 15% and 45% human voting rate improvements for visual appeal and text faithfulness, respectively.

To address this issue, we propose a CycleGAN based approach for generating FA maps directly from T1-weighted MRI scans, representing the first application of this technique to both healthy and tumour-affected tissues. Our model, trained on unpaired data, produces high fidelity maps, which have been rigorously evaluated using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), demonstrating particularly robust performance in tumour regions. Radiological assessments further underscore the model's potential to enhance clinical workflows by providing an AI-driven alternative that reduces the necessity for additional scans.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions.

Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.

However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the growing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises serious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks into the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we explore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models to circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose the first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to undermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three stages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient watermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models exhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning, evident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can reliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in intermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive experiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FissionVAE: Federated Non-IID Image Generation with Latent Space and Decoder Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17090v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data local. While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Non-IID data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We thereby introduce FissionVAE that decouples the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we incorporate hierarchical VAEs and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within FissionVAE. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decoupling process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, existing methods often suffer from performance bottlenecks when handling complex prompts that involve multiple objects, characteristics, and relations. Therefore, we propose a Multi-agent Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion (MCCD) for text-to-image generation for complex scenes. Specifically, we design a multi-agent collaboration-based scene parsing module that generates an agent system comprising multiple agents with distinct tasks, utilizing MLLMs to extract various scene elements effectively. In addition, Hierarchical Compositional diffusion utilizes a Gaussian mask and filtering to refine bounding box regions and enhance objects through region enhancement, resulting in the accurate and high-fidelity generation of complex scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MCCD significantly improves the performance of the baseline models in a training-free manner, providing a substantial advantage in complex scene generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community.

In the past few years, T2I has attracted widespread attention and numerous works have emerged. In this survey, we comprehensively review 141 works conducted from 2021 to 2024. First, we introduce four foundation model architectures of T2I (autoregression, non-autoregression, GAN and diffusion) and the commonly used key technologies (autoencoder, attention and classifier-free guidance). Secondly, we systematically compare the methods of these studies in two directions, T2I generation and T2I editing, including the encoders and the key technologies they use. In addition, we also compare the performance of these researches side by side in terms of datasets, evaluation metrics, training resources, and inference speed. In addition to the four foundation models, we survey other works on T2I, such as energy-based models and recent Mamba and multimodality. We also investigate the potential social impact of T2I and provide some solutions. Finally, we propose unique insights of improving the performance of T2I models and possible future development directions. In summary, this survey is the first systematic and comprehensive overview of T2I, aiming to provide a valuable guide for future researchers and stimulate continued progress in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages,3 figures,3 tables</p></details> | None |

Previous studies have unveiled the roles of attention blocks in the U-Net. However, they overlook the dynamic evolution of their importance during the inference process, which hinders their further exploitation to improve image applications. In this study, we first theoretically proved that, re-weighting the outputs of the Transformer blocks within the U-Net is a "free lunch" for improving the signal-to-noise ratio during the sampling process. Next, we proposed Importance Probe to uncover and quantify the dynamic shifts in importance of the Transformer blocks throughout the denoising process. Finally, we design an adaptive importance-based re-weighting schedule tailored to specific image generation and editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the inference process, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the samples with identity consistency.

We hypothesize that differences between distilled (e.g. FLUX.1-schnell) and baseline (e.g. FLUX.1-dev) models are consistent and, therefore, learnable within a specialized domain, like portrait generation. We generate a synthetic paired dataset and train a fast image-to-image translation head. Using two sets of low- and high-quality synthetic images, our model is trained to refine the output of a distilled generator (e.g., FLUX.1-schnell) to a level comparable to a baseline model like FLUX.1-dev, which is more computationally intensive. Our results show that the pipeline, which combines a distilled version of a large generative model with our enhancement layer, delivers similar photorealistic portraits to the baseline version with up to an 82% decrease in computational cost compared to FLUX.1-dev.

| **[ID-Booth: Identity-consistent Face Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07392v4)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2025, 14 pages</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth) |

Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MFCLIP: Multi-modal Fine-grained CLIP for Generalizable Diffusion Face Forgery Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09724v2)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of photo-realistic face generation methods has raised significant concerns in society and academia, highlighting the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection (FFD) techniques. Although existing approaches mainly capture face forgery patterns using image modality, other modalities like fine-grained noises and texts are not fully explored, which limits the generalization capability of the model. In addition, most FFD methods tend to identify facial images generated by GAN, but struggle to detect unseen diffusion-synthesized ones. To address the limitations, we aim to leverage the cutting-edge foundation model, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), to achieve generalizable diffusion face forgery detection (DFFD). In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fine-grained CLIP (MFCLIP) model, which mines comprehensive and fine-grained forgery traces across image-noise modalities via language-guided face forgery representation learning, to facilitate the advancement of DFFD. Specifically, we devise a fine-grained language encoder (FLE) that extracts fine global language features from hierarchical text prompts. We design a multi-modal vision encoder (MVE) to capture global image forgery embeddings as well as fine-grained noise forgery patterns extracted from the richest patch, and integrate them to mine general visual forgery traces. Moreover, we build an innovative plug-and-play sample pair attention (SPA) method to emphasize relevant negative pairs and suppress irrelevant ones, allowing cross-modality sample pairs to conduct more flexible alignment. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our model outperforms the state of the arts on different settings like cross-generator, cross-forgery, and cross-dataset evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAGAR: Retrieval Augment Personalized Image Generation Guided by Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01657v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation is crucial for improving the user experience, as it renders reference images into preferred ones according to user visual preferences. Although effective, existing methods face two main issues. First, existing methods treat all items in the user historical sequence equally when extracting user preferences, overlooking the varying semantic similarities between historical items and the reference item. Disproportionately high weights for low-similarity items distort users' visual preferences for the reference item. Second, existing methods heavily rely on consistency between generated and reference images to optimize the generation, which leads to underfitting user preferences and hinders personalization. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval Augment Personalized Image GenerAtion guided by Recommendation (RAGAR). Our approach uses a retrieval mechanism to assign different weights to historical items according to their similarities to the reference item, thereby extracting more refined users' visual preferences for the reference item. Then we introduce a novel rank task based on the multi-modal ranking model to optimize the personalization of the generated images instead of forcing depend on consistency. Extensive experiments and human evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAR achieves significant improvements in both personalization and semantic metrics compared to five baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AMO Sampler: Enhancing Text Rendering with Overshooting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19415v2)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images in text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in rendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.

To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{WorldGenBench}, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate T2I models' world knowledge grounding and implicit inferential capabilities, covering both the humanities and nature domains. We propose the \textbf{Knowledge Checklist Score}, a structured metric that measures how well generated images satisfy key semantic expectations. Experiments across 21 state-of-the-art models reveal that while diffusion models lead among open-source methods, proprietary auto-regressive models like GPT-4o exhibit significantly stronger reasoning and knowledge integration. Our findings highlight the need for deeper understanding and inference capabilities in next-generation T2I systems.

Current editing approaches, primarily designed for single-object modifications, struggle with sequential editing: especially with maintaining previous edits along with adapting new objects naturally into the existing content. These limitations significantly hinder complex editing scenarios where multiple objects need to be modified while preserving their contextual relationships. We address this fundamental challenge through two key proposals: enabling rough mask inputs that preserve existing content while naturally integrating new elements and supporting consistent editing across multiple modifications. Our framework achieves this through layer-wise memory, which stores latent representations and prompt embeddings from previous edits. We propose Background Consistency Guidance that leverages memorized latents to maintain scene coherence and Multi-Query Disentanglement in cross-attention that ensures natural adaptation to existing content. To evaluate our method, we present a new benchmark dataset incorporating semantic alignment metrics and interactive editing scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance in iterative image editing tasks with minimal user effort, requiring only rough masks while maintaining high-quality results throughout multiple editing steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Recent approaches have further extended these methods with personalization techniques that allow them to integrate user-illustrated concepts (e.g., the user him/herself) using a few sample image illustrations. However, the ability to generate images with multiple interacting concepts, such as human subjects, as well as concepts that may be entangled in one, or across multiple, image illustrations remains illusive. In this work, we propose a concept-driven TTI personalization framework that addresses these core challenges. We build on existing works that learn custom tokens for user-illustrated concepts, allowing those to interact with existing text tokens in the TTI model. However, importantly, to disentangle and better learn the concepts in question, we jointly learn (latent) segmentation masks that disentangle these concepts in user-provided image illustrations. We do so by introducing an Expectation Maximization (EM)-like optimization procedure where we alternate between learning the custom tokens and estimating (latent) masks encompassing corresponding concepts in user-supplied images. We obtain these masks based on cross-attention, from within the U-Net parameterized latent diffusion model and subsequent DenseCRF optimization. We illustrate that such joint alternating refinement leads to the learning of better tokens for concepts and, as a by-product, latent masks. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach qualitatively and quantitatively with several examples and use cases that can combine three or more entangled concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Fi...</summary><p>11 Figures, 14 Pages, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

In computer vision, the attention mechanism was first incorporated in the Vision Transformer ViT, and then its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While the attention mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the disadvantage of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more attempts with different sets of advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block. The newly proposed block reduces the computational requirements by replacing the normal attention layers with a Network in Network structure, therefore enhancing the static approach of the MLP-Mixer with a dynamic learning of element-wise gating function generated by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Comput & Applic (2025)</p></details> | None |

However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e., adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional generation.

However, training these two stages separately leads to significant data bias in the inference phase, thus affecting the quality of reconstructed results. We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions. The recursive diffusion framework with 3D-aware feedback unites the entire process and improves geometric consistency.Experiments show that our framework outperforms separation of these two stages and existing methods that combine them at the inference phase.

However, generating high-fidelity personalized images with specific subjects still presents challenges, especially in cases involving multiple subjects. In this paper, we propose AnyStory, a unified approach for personalized subject generation. AnyStory not only achieves high-fidelity personalization for single subjects, but also for multiple subjects, without sacrificing subject fidelity. Specifically, AnyStory models the subject personalization problem in an "encode-then-route" manner. In the encoding step, AnyStory utilizes a universal and powerful image encoder, i.e., ReferenceNet, in conjunction with CLIP vision encoder to achieve high-fidelity encoding of subject features. In the routing step, AnyStory utilizes a decoupled instance-aware subject router to accurately perceive and predict the potential location of the corresponding subject in the latent space, and guide the injection of subject conditions. Detailed experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method in retaining subject details, aligning text descriptions, and personalizing for multiple subjects.

This technical report presents the first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions: (1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and beyond.

| **[EZIGen: Enhancing zero-shot personalized image generation with precise subject encoding and decoupled guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08091v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot personalized image generation models aim to produce images that align with both a given text prompt and subject image, requiring the model to incorporate both sources of guidance. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained subject details and frequently prioritize one form of guidance over the other, resulting in suboptimal subject encoding and imbalanced generation. In this study, we uncover key insights into overcoming such drawbacks, notably that 1) the choice of the subject image encoder critically influences subject identity preservation and training efficiency, and 2) the text and subject guidance should take effect at different denoising stages. Building on these insights, we introduce a new approach, EZIGen, that employs two main components: leveraging a fixed pre-trained Diffusion UNet itself as subject encoder, following a process that balances the two guidances by separating their dominance stage and revisiting certain time steps to bootstrap subject transfer quality. Through these two components, EZIGen, initially built upon SD2.1-base, achieved state-of-the-art performances on multiple personalized generation benchmarks with a unified model, while using 100 times less training data. Moreover, by further migrating our design to SDXL, EZIGen is proven to be a versatile model-agnostic solution for personalized generation.

Given a reference image, this requires adapting the appearance of a generated 3D asset to reflect the visual style of the reference while maintaining visual consistency from multiple viewpoints. To tackle this problem, we draw inspiration from the success of 2D stylization methods that leverage the attention mechanisms in large image generation models to capture and transfer visual style. In particular, we probe if large reconstruction models, commonly used in the context of 3D generation, has a similar capability. We discover that the certain attention blocks in these models capture the appearance specific features. By injecting features from a visual style image to such blocks, we develop a simple yet effective 3D appearance stylization method. Our method does not require training or test time optimization. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results in terms of 3D appearance stylization, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality visual outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025</p></details> | None |

When GPT-4o Generation Ushers in Image Compression Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21814v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of AIGC foundation models has revolutionized the paradigm of image compression, which paves the way for the abandonment of most pixel-level transform and coding, compelling us to ask: why compress what you can generate if the AIGC foundation model is powerful enough to faithfully generate intricate structure and fine-grained details from nothing more than some compact descriptors, i.e., texts, or cues. Fortunately, recent GPT-4o image generation of OpenAI has achieved impressive cross-modality generation, editing, and design capabilities, which motivates us to answer the above question by exploring its potential in image compression fields. In this work, we investigate two typical compression paradigms: textual coding and multimodal coding (i.e., text + extremely low-resolution image), where all/most pixel-level information is generated instead of compressing via the advanced GPT-4o image generation function. The essential challenge lies in how to maintain semantic and structure consistency during the decoding process. To overcome this, we propose a structure raster-scan prompt engineering mechanism to transform the image into textual space, which is compressed as the condition of GPT-4o image generation. Extensive experiments have shown that the combination of our designed structural raster-scan prompts and GPT-4o's image generation function achieved the impressive performance compared with recent multimodal/generative image compression at ultra-low bitrate, further indicating the potential of AIGC generation in image compression fields.</p></details> |  | None |

An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p></details> |  | None |

Developing algorithms capable of automatically synthesizing vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. However, existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few approaches can directly synthesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthesize high-quality vector fonts using signed distance functions (SDFs). Specifically, based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by several parabolic curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic B\'ezier curves that are widely used in vector font products. In this manner, most image generation methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis, markedly outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Latent Feature-Guided Conditional Diffusion for High-Fidelity Generative Image Semantic Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21577v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication is proposed and expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of massive data transmission over sixth generation (6G) networks. However, existing deep learning-based joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) image semantic communication scheme predominantly focuses on optimizing pixel-level metrics, and neglects human perceptual requirements, which results in degraded perceptual quality. To address this issue, we propose a latent representation-oriented image semantic communication (LRISC) system, which transmits latent semantic features for image generation with semantic consistency, thereby ensuring the perceptual quality at the receiver. In particular, we first map the source image to latent features in a high-dimensional semantic space via a neural network (NN)- based non-linear transformation. Subsequently, these features are encoded using a joint source and channel coding (JSCC) scheme with adaptive coding length for efficient transmission over a wireless channel. At the receiver, a conditional diffusion model is developed by using the received latent features as conditional guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, progressively reconstructing high-fidelity images while preserving semantic consistency. Moreover, we introduce a channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation mechanism, allowing one model to work across various channel states. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods, in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) and robustness against channel noise, with an average LPIPS reduction of 43.3% compared to DeepJSCC, while guaranteeing the semantic consistency.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures | None |

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$, compared to $O(N)$ for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

Generating fonts for complex languages like Korean and Chinese, particularly in handwritten styles, presents significant challenges. Traditional AFGs, like Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), are usually unstable during training and often face mode collapse problems. They also struggle to capture fine details within font images. To address these problems, we present a diffusion-based AFG method which generates high-quality, diverse Korean font images using only a single reference image, focusing on handwritten and printed styles. Our approach refines noisy images incrementally, ensuring stable training and visually appealing results. A key innovation is our text encoder, which processes phonetic representations to generate accurate and contextually correct characters, even for unseen characters. We used a pre-trained style encoder from DG FONT to effectively and accurately encode the style images. To further enhance the generation quality, we used perceptual loss that guides the model to focus on the global style of generated images. Experimental results on over 2000 Korean characters demonstrate that our model consistently generates accurate and detailed font images and outperforms benchmark methods, making it a reliable tool for generating authentic Korean fonts across different styles.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at ICOIN 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods are limited to providing global quality scores, failing to deliver fine-grained perceptual evaluations for structurally complex subjects like humans, which is a critical challenge considering the frequent anatomical and textural distortions in AI-generated human images (AGHIs). To address this gap, we introduce AGHI-QA, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed for quality assessment of AGHIs. The dataset comprises 4,000 images generated from 400 carefully crafted text prompts using 10 state of-the-art T2I models. We conduct a systematic subjective study to collect multidimensional annotations, including perceptual quality scores, text-image correspondence scores, visible and distorted body part labels. Based on AGHI-QA, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current T2I methods in generating human images from multiple dimensions. Furthermore, we propose AGHI-Assessor, a novel quality metric that integrates the large multimodal model (LMM) with domain-specific human features for precise quality prediction and identification of visible and distorted body parts in AGHIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGHI-Assessor showcases state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing IQA methods in multidimensional quality assessment and surpassing leading LMMs in detecting structural distortions in AGHIs.</p></details> |  | None |

The prevailing paradigm has commonly employed self-attention with quadratic computational complexity to handle global spatial relationships in complex images, thereby synthesizing high-fidelity images with coherent visual semantics.Contrary to conventional wisdom, our systematic layer-wise analysis reveals an interesting discrepancy: self-attention in pre-trained diffusion models predominantly exhibits localized attention patterns, closely resembling convolutional inductive biases. This suggests that global interactions in self-attention may be less critical than commonly assumed.Driven by this, we propose \(\Delta\)ConvFusion to replace conventional self-attention modules with Pyramid Convolution Blocks (\(\Delta\)ConvBlocks).By distilling attention patterns into localized convolutional operations while keeping other components frozen, \(\Delta\)ConvFusion achieves performance comparable to transformer-based counterparts while reducing computational cost by 6929$\times$ and surpassing LinFusion by 5.42$\times$ in efficiency--all without compromising generative fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

The malevolent use of synthetic images, such as the dissemination of fake news or the creation of fake profiles, however, raises significant concerns regarding the authenticity of images. Though many forensic algorithms have been developed for detecting synthetic images, their performance, especially the generalization capability, is still far from being adequate to cope with the increasing number of synthetic models. In this work, we propose a simple yet very effective synthetic image detection method via a language-guided contrastive learning. Specifically, we augment the training images with carefully-designed textual labels, enabling us to use a joint visual-language contrastive supervision for learning a forensic feature space with better generalization.

Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.18% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks. With fine-tuning on a turbulence dataset, we show that the method adapts to new settings with more than 40% better accuracy over prior methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In various Text-to-Image or Image-to-Image tasks, attackers can generate a series of images containing inappropriate content by simply editing the language modality input. To mitigate this security concern, numerous guarding or defensive strategies have been proposed, with a particular emphasis on safeguarding language modality. However, in practical applications, threats in the vision modality, particularly in tasks involving the editing of real-world images, present heightened security risks as they can easily infringe upon the rights of the image owner. Therefore, this paper employs a method named typographic attack to reveal that various image generation models are also susceptible to threats within the vision modality. Furthermore, we also evaluate the defense performance of various existing methods when facing threats in the vision modality and uncover their ineffectiveness. Finally, we propose the Vision Modal Threats in Image Generation Models (VMT-IGMs) dataset, which would serve as a baseline for evaluating the vision modality vulnerability of various image generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accept by CVPR2025 (https://cvpr.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/poster/34964)</p></details> | None |

We evaluate Greedy Coordinate Gradients (GCG), PEZ , Random Search, AutoDAN and BLIP2's image captioner across various evaluation metrics related to the quality of inverted prompts and the quality of the images generated by the inverted prompts. We find that focusing on the CLIP similarity between the inverted prompts and the ground truth image acts as a poor proxy for the similarity between ground truth image and the image generated by the inverted prompts. While the discrete optimizers effectively minimize their objectives, simply using responses from a well-trained captioner often leads to generated images that more closely resemble those produced by the original prompts.</p></details> | 11 Pages, 3 Figures | None |

We further build the Efficient Listener Network (ELNet) specially designed to accommodate both the visual and audio information of the speaker as input. Considering of FAD and ELNet, the proposed method learns effective listener facial motion representations and leads to improvements of performance over the state-of-the-art methods while reducing 99% computational time.</p></details> |  | None |

The complexity and the sheer number of available generative techniques, as well as the scarcity of high-quality open source datasets of diverse nature for this task, make training and benchmarking synthetic image source attribution models very challenging. WILD is a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset designed to provide a powerful training and benchmarking tool for synthetic image attribution models. The dataset is built out of a closed set of 10 popular commercial generators, which constitutes the training base of attribution models, and an open set of 10 additional generators, simulating a real-world in-the-wild scenario. Each generator is represented by 1,000 images, for a total of 10,000 images in the closed set and 10,000 images in the open set. Half of the images are post-processed with a wide range of operators. WILD allows benchmarking attribution models in a wide range of tasks, including closed and open set identification and verification, and robust attribution with respect to post-processing and adversarial attacks. Models trained on WILD are expected to benefit from the challenging scenario represented by the dataset itself. Moreover, an assessment of seven baseline methodologies on closed and open set attribution is presented, including robustness tests with respect to post-processing.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have explored novel attention mechanisms, lightweight architectures, and context-aware modeling, demonstrating impressive performance. However, they often struggle with complex structure (e.g., texture, shape, spatial relations) and semantics (e.g., color consistency, object restoration, and logical correctness), leading to artifacts and inappropriate generation. To address this challenge, we design a simple yet effective inpainting paradigm called latent categories guidance, and further propose a diffusion-based model named PixelHacker. Specifically, we first construct a large dataset containing 14 million image-mask pairs by annotating foreground and background (potential 116 and 21 categories, respectively). Then, we encode potential foreground and background representations separately through two fixed-size embeddings, and intermittently inject these features into the denoising process via linear attention. Finally, by pre-training on our dataset and fine-tuning on open-source benchmarks, we obtain PixelHacker. Extensive experiments show that PixelHacker comprehensively outperforms the SOTA on a wide range of datasets (Places2, CelebA-HQ, and FFHQ) and exhibits remarkable consistency in both structure and semantics.

Through targeted prompts, we explore whether DALL-E perpetuates stereotypical representations of animals, such as "owls as wise," "foxes as unfaithful," etc. Our findings reveal significant stereotyped instances where the model consistently generates images aligned with cultural biases. The current work is the first of its kind to examine animal stereotyping in vision-language models systematically and to highlight a critical yet underexplored dimension of bias in AI-generated visual content.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-Interrelated Diffusion Model for Few-Shot Anomaly Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13509v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of anomaly inspection in industrial manufacturing is constrained by the scarcity of anomaly data. To overcome this challenge, researchers have started employing anomaly generation approaches to augment the anomaly dataset. However, existing anomaly generation methods suffer from limited diversity in the generated anomalies and struggle to achieve a seamless blending of this anomaly with the original image. Moreover, the generated mask is usually not aligned with the generated anomaly. In this paper, we overcome these challenges from a new perspective, simultaneously generating a pair of the overall image and the corresponding anomaly part. We propose DualAnoDiff, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly image generation model, which can generate diverse and realistic anomaly images by using a dual-interrelated diffusion model, where one of them is employed to generate the whole image while the other one generates the anomaly part. Moreover, we extract background and shape information to mitigate the distortion and blurriness phenomenon in few-shot image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, realism and the accuracy of mask. Overall, our approach significantly improves the performance of downstream anomaly inspection tasks, including anomaly detection, anomaly localization, and anomaly classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Inception: Jailbreak the Memory Mechanism of Text-to-Image Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20376v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the memory mechanism has been widely and successfully exploited in online text-to-image (T2I) generation systems ($e.g.$, DALL$\cdot$E 3) for alleviating the growing tokenization burden and capturing key information in multi-turn interactions. Despite its practicality, its security analyses have fallen far behind. In this paper, we reveal that this mechanism exacerbates the risk of jailbreak attacks. Different from previous attacks that fuse the unsafe target prompt into one ultimate adversarial prompt, which can be easily detected or may generate non-unsafe images due to under- or over-optimization, we propose Inception, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack against the memory mechanism in real-world text-to-image generation systems. Inception embeds the malice at the inception of the chat session turn by turn, leveraging the mechanism that T2I generation systems retrieve key information in their memory. Specifically, Inception mainly consists of two modules. It first segments the unsafe prompt into chunks, which are subsequently fed to the system in multiple turns, serving as pseudo-gradients for directive optimization. Specifically, we develop a series of segmentation policies that ensure the images generated are semantically consistent with the target prompt. Secondly, after segmentation, to overcome the challenge of the inseparability of minimum unsafe words, we propose recursion, a strategy that makes minimum unsafe words subdivisible. Collectively, segmentation and recursion ensure that all the request prompts are benign but can lead to malicious outcomes. We conduct experiments on the real-world text-to-image generation system ($i.e.$, DALL$\cdot$E 3) to validate the effectiveness of Inception. The results indicate that Inception surpasses the state-of-the-art by a 14\% margin in attack success rate.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Scalable Surrogate Verification of Image-based Neural Network Control Systems using Composition and Unrolling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18554v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-25 | None |

Efficacy of Iterative Human-Driven Prompt Refinement in Image Regeneration Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20340v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With AI-generated content becoming ubiquitous across the web, social media, and other digital platforms, it is vital to examine how such content are inspired and generated. The creation of AI-generated images often involves refining the input prompt iteratively to achieve desired visual outcomes. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored concept of image regeneration using AI, in which a human operator attempts to closely recreate a specific target image by iteratively refining their prompt. Image regeneration is distinct from normal image generation, which lacks any predefined visual reference. A separate challenge lies in determining whether existing image similarity metrics (ISMs) can provide reliable, objective feedback in iterative workflows, given that we do not fully understand if subjective human judgments of similarity align with these metrics. Consequently, we must first validate their alignment with human perception before assessing their potential as a feedback mechanism in the iterative prompt refinement process. To address these research gaps, we present a structured user study evaluating how iterative prompt refinement affects the similarity of regenerated images relative to their targets, while also examining whether ISMs capture the same improvements perceived by human observers. Our findings suggest that incremental prompt adjustments substantially improve alignment, verified through both subjective evaluations and quantitative measures, underscoring the broader potential of iterative workflows to enhance generative AI content creation across various application domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Physics-based simulations are commonly used to address this data scarcity, although they are slow and constrain end-to-end learning. In this work, we explore a new direction for more efficient and end-to-end SAR ship wake simulation using a diffusion model trained on data generated by a physics-based simulator. The training dataset is built by pairing images produced by the simulator with text prompts derived from simulation parameters. Experimental result show that the model generates realistic Kelvin wake patterns and achieves significantly faster inference than the physics-based simulator. These results highlight the potential of diffusion models for fast and controllable wake image generation, opening new possibilities for end-to-end downstream tasks in maritime SAR analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages; Submitted Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS) - 2025</p></details> | None |

To address these limitations, we start from an naive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for text rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present RepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation models with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate, multilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really understand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and additionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to enable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text content, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text perceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to stabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize with noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region masks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid distortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach outperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to native multi-language closed-source models. To be more fair, we also exhaustively discuss its limitations in the end.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report. https://reptext.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM is a model that incorporates pixel-level operations while maintaining the same training process as DDPM. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).</p></details> |  | None |

Existing image watermarking methods, though partially effective, often rely on post-processing or reference images, and struggle to balance fidelity, robustness, and tamper localization. To address these limitations, we propose GenPTW, an In-Generation image watermarking framework for latent diffusion models (LDMs), which integrates Provenance Tracing and Tamper Localization into a unified Watermark-based design. It embeds structured watermark signals during the image generation phase, enabling unified provenance tracing and tamper localization. For extraction, we construct a frequency-coordinated decoder to improve robustness and localization precision in complex editing scenarios. Additionally, a distortion layer that simulates AIGC editing is introduced to enhance robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenPTW outperforms existing methods in image fidelity, watermark extraction accuracy, and tamper localization performance, offering an efficient and practical solution for trustworthy AIGC image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in text-to-image models have facilitated generative data augmentation by synthesizing images from labeled data, yet existing methods based solely on class names or reference captions often fail to balance visual diversity and style consistency. In this work, we propose \textbf{Masked Language Prompting (MLP)}, a novel prompting strategy that masks selected words in a reference caption and leverages large language models to generate diverse yet semantically coherent completions. This approach preserves the structural semantics of the original caption while introducing attribute-level variations aligned with the intended style, enabling style-consistent and diverse image generation without fine-tuning. Experimental results on the FashionStyle14 dataset demonstrate that our MLP-based augmentation consistently outperforms class-name and caption-based baselines, validating its effectiveness for fashion style recognition under limited supervision.</p></details> |  | None |

Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</p></details> |  | None |

Similar to traditional multi-shot generation, our task emphasizes the need for consistency and continuity across frames. However, our task also focuses on addressing challenges inherent to filmmaking, such as multiple characters, complex interactions, and visual cinematic effects. In order to learn to generate such content, we first create the CineVerse dataset. We use this dataset to train our proposed two-stage approach. First, we prompt a large language model (LLM) with task-specific instructions to take in a high-level scene description and generate a detailed plan for the overall setting and characters, as well as the individual shots. Then, we fine-tune a text-to-image generation model to synthesize high-quality visual keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that CineVerse yields promising improvements in generating visually coherent and contextually rich movie scenes, paving the way for further exploration in cinematic video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>link ...</summary><p>link website: https://cinevers.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More visualizations on Homepage: https://alpha-innovator.github.io/OmniCaptioner-project-page and Official code: https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/OmniCaptioner</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/OmniCaptioner) |

Here, $k$ is a scaling parameter that organizes frequency bands (or projected coefficients), and amplitude describes the norm of such projected coefficients. By incorporating the $K$-amplitude decomposition, K-Flow enables flow matching across the scaling parameter as time. We discuss three venues and six properties of K-Flow, from theoretical foundations, energy and temporal dynamics, and practical applications, respectively. Specifically, from the practical usage perspective, K-Flow allows steerable generation by controlling the information at different scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness of K-Flow, we conduct experiments on unconditional image generation, class-conditional image generation, and molecule assembly generation. Additionally, we conduct three ablation studies to demonstrate how K-Flow steers scaling parameter to effectively control the resolution of image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653v5)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques. In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities. Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7 points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively. These findings highlight USM as a highly efficient and scalable solution for diffusion-based generative models, making high-quality image synthesis more accessible to the research community while reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 eLVM workshop.

| **[Predicting Stress in Two-phase Random Materials and Super-Resolution Method for Stress Images by Embedding Physical Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18854v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions. Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints, which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing solutions have tackled these challenges by optimizing the cross-attention mechanism or learning from the caption pairs with minimal semantic changes. However, can we generate high-quality complex contrastive images that diffusion models can directly discriminate based on visual representations? In this work, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to compose realistic, complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) systems alongside diffusion models to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases, i.e., hard negative images, we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of compositional scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework on compositional T2I benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of up to +4% in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 85% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

In order to deploy these models in extremely resource-constrained edge devices, it is crucial to reduce their peak memory, which is the maximum memory consumed during the execution of a model. A naive approach to reducing peak memory is aggressive down-sampling of feature maps via pooling with large stride, which often results in unacceptable degradation in network performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose residual encoded distillation (ReDistill) for peak memory reduction in a teacher-student framework, in which a student network with less memory is derived from the teacher network using aggressive pooling. We apply our distillation method to multiple problems in computer vision, including image classification and diffusion-based image generation. For image classification, our method yields 4x-5x theoretical peak memory reduction with less degradation in accuracy for most CNN-based architectures. For diffusion-based image generation, our proposed distillation method yields a denoising network with 4x lower theoretical peak memory while maintaining decent diversity and fidelity for image generation. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to other feature-based and response-based distillation methods when applied to the same student network.

However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.
