| **[Locality-aware Parallel Decoding for Efficient Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01957v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2) Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256 to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized autoregressive models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> | None |

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |
| **[FreeLoRA: Enabling Training-Free LoRA Fusion for Autoregressive Multi-Subject Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01792v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization, as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject fidelity and prompt consistency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BizGen: Advancing Article-level Visual Text Rendering for Infographics Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20672v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models, such as Flux and Ideogram 2.0, have made significant progress in sentence-level visual text rendering. In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data. In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG. We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component. We hope our constructed Infographics-650K and BizEval can encourage the broader community to advance the progress of business content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

| **[Mod-Adapter: Tuning-Free and Versatile Multi-concept Personalization via Modulation Adapter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18612v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://weizhi-zhong.github.io/Mod-Adapter</p></details> | [Code Link](https://weizhi-zhong.github.io/Mod-Adapter) |
| **[Autoregressive Image Generation with Linear Complexity: A Spatial-Aware Decay Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01652v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than 1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial understanding needed for high-quality generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Representation Entanglement for Generation:Training Diffusion Transformers Is Much Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01467v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models, through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\% increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively, SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer).

| **[DiffMark: Diffusion-based Robust Watermark Against Deepfakes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01428v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF) module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention. To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark) |
| **[UniGlyph: Unified Segmentation-Conditioned Diffusion for Precise Visual Text Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00992v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs, semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks -- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark, significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks: GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong generalization and deployment readiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Backdooring Bias (B^2) into Stable Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15213v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large text-conditional diffusion models have revolutionized image generation by enabling users to create realistic, high-quality images from textual prompts, significantly enhancing artistic creation and visual communication. However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier ($10-$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to USENIX Security '25</p></details> | None |
| **[SD-Acc: Accelerating Stable Diffusion through Phase-aware Sampling and Hardware Co-Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01309v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced generative AI, improving the quality, realism, and creativity of image and video generation. Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse weight and activation sizes. We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework. At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation. Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than traditional CPU and GPU implementations.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity, restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach. TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency.

| **[BEV-VAE: Multi-view Image Generation with Spatial Consistency for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00707v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view image generation in autonomous driving demands consistent 3D scene understanding across camera views. Most existing methods treat this problem as a 2D image set generation task, lacking explicit 3D modeling. However, we argue that a structured representation is crucial for scene generation, especially for autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes BEV-VAE for consistent and controllable view synthesis. BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image variational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then generates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports arbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D layouts. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 (AV2) show strong performance in both 3D consistent reconstruction and generation.

| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/qhfan/MALA) |

However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, 3rd Word Congress on Artificial Intelligence in Materials & Manufacturing 2025</p></details> | None |

To address these challenges, we present MedDiff-FT, a controllable medical image generation method that fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model to produce medical images with structural dependency and domain specificity in a data-efficient manner. During inference, a dynamic adaptive guiding mask enforces spatial constraints to ensure anatomically coherent synthesis, while a lightweight stochastic mask generator enhances diversity through hierarchical randomness injection. Additionally, an automated quality assessment protocol filters suboptimal outputs using feature-space metrics, followed by mask corrosion to refine fidelity. Evaluated on five medical segmentation datasets,MedDiff-FT's synthetic image-mask pairs improve SOTA method's segmentation performance by an average of 1% in Dice score. The framework effectively balances generation quality, diversity, and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical data augmentation.

| **[Efficient Depth- and Spatially-Varying Image Simulation for Defocus Deblur](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00372v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Generalized and Training-Free Text-Guided Semantic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17269v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided semantic manipulation refers to semantically editing an image generated from a source prompt to match a target prompt, enabling the desired semantic changes (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) while preserving irrelevant contents. With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations (poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play) across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2) $\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in semantics manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ayanami-yu.github.io/GTF-Project-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ayanami-yu.github.io/GTF-Project-Page) |

However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

| **[Ovis-U1 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23044v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B.

In the context of brain MRIs, existing CA approaches rely on supervised contrastive learning or variational autoencoders (VAEs) using both healthy and unhealthy data, but such reliance on target samples is challenging in clinical settings. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) offers an alternative by learning a reference representation of healthy anatomy without the need for target samples. Deviations from this reference distribution can indicate potential anomalies. In this context, diffusion models have been increasingly adopted in UAD due to their superior performance in image generation compared to VAEs. Nonetheless, precisely reconstructing the anatomy of the brain remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework to improve the reconstruction quality by training a self-supervised contrastive encoder on healthy images to extract meaningful anatomical features. These features are used to condition a diffusion model to reconstruct the healthy appearance of a given image, enabling interpretable anomaly localization via pixel-wise comparison. We validate our approach through a proof-of-concept on a facial image dataset and further demonstrate its effectiveness on four brain MRI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art anomaly localization performance on the NOVA benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards 3D Semantic Image Synthesis for Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00206v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM (Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical 3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images (0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

For instance, generating an image of skin lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis, such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic, colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover, to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts) into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving 100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios: each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome. These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> | None |

Instead of a single patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow, our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$) inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance. Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with small training time.

While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views. Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

Transformer combined with diffusion models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless, existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details. To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT) is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 11pages, 11 figures | None |

However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment, and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://annealing-guidance.github.io/annealing-guidance/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://annealing-guidance.github.io/annealing-guidance) |

However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is available at https://imagineforme.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Existing methods focus on the integration of diverse generative information into controlling inputs, utilizing frameworks such as GLIGEN or ControlNet, to produce commendable outcomes in controllable generation.

To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity. We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.</p></details> |  | None |

This contrasts with signal processing techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet analyses, which often employ hierarchical decompositions. Inspired by such principles, particularly the idea of signal separation, we introduce a diffusion framework leveraging multi-scale latent factorization. Our framework uniquely decomposes the denoising target, typically latent features from a pretrained Variational Autoencoder, into a low-frequency base signal capturing core structural information and a high-frequency residual signal that contributes finer, high-frequency details like textures. This decomposition into base and residual components directly informs our two-stage image generation process, which first produces the low-resolution base, followed by the generation of the high-resolution residual. Our proposed architecture facilitates reduced sampling steps during the residual learning stage, owing to the inherent ease of modeling residual information, which confers advantages over conventional full-resolution generation techniques. This specific approach of decomposing the signal into a base and a residual, conceptually akin to how wavelet analysis can separate different frequency bands, yields a more streamlined and intuitive design distinct from generic hierarchical models. Our method, \name\ (Multi-Scale Factorization), demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving FID scores of 2.08 ($256\times256$) and 2.47 ($512\times512$) on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, outperforming the DiT baseline (2.27 and 3.04 respectively) while also delivering a $4\times$ speed-up with the same number of sampling steps.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we identify that this slow convergence is partly due to the complexity of the Brownian motion driving the forward-time process. To address this, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, truncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel ordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL diffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By developing an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the integration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the widely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our modifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving the network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method significantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence speeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and ultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for highly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters, and can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods.

However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods.

A critical limitation stems from the discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation, we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the current state-of-the-art generation models, like Stable Diffusion, cannot handle fine-grained part-level attributes in the text prompts. Specifically, when additional attribute details are added to the base text prompt, these text-to-image models either generate an image vastly different from the image generated from the base prompt or ignore the attribute details. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartComposer, a training-free method that enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level attributes specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartComposer first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each part region based on fine-grained part attributes and combine them to produce the final image. All stages of PartComposer are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartComposer through qualitative visual examples and quantitative comparisons with contemporary baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page Will Be Here: https://rangwani-harsh.github.io/PartCraft</p></details> | [Code Link](https://rangwani-harsh.github.io/PartCraft) |

This issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps, resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference speeds.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Disrupting Model Merging: A Parameter-Level Defense Without Sacrificing Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07661v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging is a technique that combines multiple finetuned models into a single model without additional training, allowing a free-rider to cheaply inherit specialized capabilities. This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.

Prompt-based methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models, providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.</p></details> |  | None |

A fundamental element of the transformer architecture is self-attention, which allows the model to capture intricate dependencies within the data. However, the self-attention mechanism also incurs significant computational and memory costs, particularly for long sequences. In this paper, we introduce ATTENTION2D, a novel approach that exploits parallelism along two dimensions - query and key/value - of the self-attention operation. This method enables efficient distribution and parallelization of computations across multiple devices. Our approach facilitates asymptotically faster training and inference phases compared to previous methods, without relying on approximations or incurring additional computational or memory overheads. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques that struggle to scale with an increasing number of processing units, our approach effectively scales with additional processing units. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving communication efficiency and scalability. Compared to Ring Attention, our approach demonstrated up to a 5x performance boost on a GPT-3-like model using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs across 16 nodes, and up to a 9.4x performance boost on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 64 nodes.</p></details> | Updated Table 1 | None |

We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation. In addition, it provides native high-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Seedr...</summary><p>Seedream 3.0 Technical Report</p></details> | None |

However, images generated by these methods are often plagued by spatial artifacts such as blurring and ghosting, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse-input scenarios, it becomes even more necessary to use NVS-generated data to assist localization. We design a coarse-to-fine Points of Interest (PoI) variant using sparse-input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy, achieving state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper explores these technological shifts, with particular focus on how those that have emerged since our previous review in 2022 have expanded creative opportunities and improved efficiency. These technological advancements have enhanced the capabilities of text-to-image, text-to-video, and multimodal generation technologies. In particular, key breakthroughs in LLMs have established new benchmarks in conversational AI, while advancements in image generators have revolutionized content creation. We also discuss the integration of AI into post-production workflows, which has significantly accelerated and improved traditional processes. Once content has been created, it must be delivered to its audiences; the media industry is now facing the demands of increased communication traffic due to creative content. We therefore include a discussion of how AI is beginning to transform the way we represent and compress media content. We highlight the trend toward unified AI frameworks capable of addressing and integrating multiple creative tasks, and we underscore the importance of human insight to drive the creative process and oversight to mitigate AI-generated inaccuracies.

However, the equally important area of remote sensing image (RSI) editing has not received sufficient attention. Deep learning based editing methods generally involve two sequential stages: generation and editing.For natural images, these stages primarily rely on generative backbones pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets and text guidance facilitated by vision-language models (VLMs). However, it become less viable for RSIs: First, existing generative RSI benchmark datasets do not fully capture the diversity of RSIs, and is often inadequate for universal editing tasks. Second, the single text semantic corresponds to multiple image semantics, leading to the introduction of incorrect semantics.To solve above problems, this paper proposes a text-guided RSI editing method and can be trained using only a single image. A multi-scale training approach is adopted to preserve consistency without the need for training on extensive benchmarks, while leveraging RSI pre-trained VLMs and prompt ensembling (PE) to ensure accuracy and controllability. Experimental results on multiple RSI editing tasks show that the proposed method offers significant advantages in both CLIP scores and subjective evaluations compared to existing methods. Additionally, we explore the ability of the edited RSIs to support disaster assessment tasks in order to validate their practicality.

Current finetuning-free methods simply adopt a single training stage with a simple image reconstruction task, and they typically generate low-quality images inconsistent with the reference images during test-time. To mitigate this problem, inspired by the recent DPO (i.e., direct preference optimization) technique, this work proposes an additional training stage to improve the pre-trained personalized generation models. However, traditional DPO only determines the overall superiority or inferiority of two samples, which is not suitable for personalized image generation because the generated images are commonly inconsistent with the reference images only in some local image patches. To tackle this problem, this work proposes PatchDPO that estimates the quality of image patches within each generated image and accordingly trains the model. To this end, PatchDPO first leverages the pre-trained vision model with a proposed self-supervised training method to estimate the patch quality. Next, PatchDPO adopts a weighted training approach to train the model with the estimated patch quality, which rewards the image patches with high quality while penalizing the image patches with low quality. Experiment results demonstrate that PatchDPO significantly improves the performance of multiple pre-trained personalized generation models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-object and multi-object personalized image generation.

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey.

However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption.

This study addresses this challenge by proposing a wavelet-based conditional Diffusion GAN scheme for Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Our approach utilizes the diffusion GAN paradigm to reduce the timesteps required by the reverse diffusion process and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to achieve dimensionality reduction, decreasing training and inference times significantly. The results of an experimental validation on the CelebA-HQ dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

| **[On the Feasibility of Poisoning Text-to-Image AI Models via Adversarial Mislabeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21874v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective, they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success (over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex AI and Microsoft Azure).</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM C...</summary><p>ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.</p></details> |  | None |

Although such models can generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our $\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for high-quality sampling.

However, these models still struggle with panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.</p></details> |  | None |

Researchers are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed. By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes, simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images significantly improve downstream perception models performance.

We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency.

These models operate in a bitwise autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore, it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable detection of generated outputs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Moderating the Generalization of Score-based Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07229v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization abilities, e.g. generating unseen, but natural data. However, the greater the generalization power, the more likely the unintended generalization, and the more dangerous the abuse. Research on moderated generalization in SGMs remains limited. To fill this gap, we first examine the current 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model after removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in SGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard' does not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness. Based on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative Model (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects the score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time stochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating undesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image generation. Albeit designed for SGMs, MSGM is a general and flexible MU framework that is compatible with diverse diffusion architectures (SGM and DDPM) and training strategies (re-training and fine-tuning), and enables zero-shot transfer of the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, e.g. image inpainting and reconstruction. The code will be shared upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e., adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional generation.

Recent advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents. By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128 discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10 times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware noise.</p></details> |  | None |

Restricted attention mechanisms significantly reduce these computational burdens but come at the cost of losing either global or local coherence. We propose a simple, yet powerful method to reduce these trade-offs: allow the attention heads of a single transformer to attend to multiple receptive fields. We demonstrate our method utilizing Neighborhood Attention (NA) and integrate it into a StyleGAN based architecture for image generation. With this work, dubbed StyleNAT, we are able to achieve a FID of 2.05 on FFHQ, a 6% improvement over StyleGAN-XL, while utilizing 28% fewer parameters and with 4$\times$ the throughput capacity. StyleNAT achieves the Pareto Frontier on FFHQ-256 and demonstrates powerful and efficient image generation on other datasets.

However, dense representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods. Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species generation through sparse signals.

Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However, existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation, classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models, depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include: (1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2) the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at https://github.com/zgg2577/VS-KC.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

Existing steering methods suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to $5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video Perception Models for 3D Scene Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20601v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability, which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes. Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation, utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse scenarios. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

However, training diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free, zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring retraining or architectural modifications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, removing undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation (WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark, Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to ensure concept fidelity and alignment.

Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering or concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the model's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce AlignGuard, a method for safety alignment of T2I models. We enable the application of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7x more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. AlignGuard consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks.

However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks.

Hence, many text-to-image models have implemented diversification mechanisms. Yet, after a few iterations of generation, a lack of diversity becomes apparent, because each user has their own diversity goals (e.g., different colors, brands of cars), and there are diverse attributions to be specified. To support user-driven diversity control, we propose Varif.ai that employs text-to-image and Large Language Models to iteratively i) (re)generate a set of images, ii) verify if user-specified attributes have sufficient coverage, and iii) vary existing or new attributes. Through an elicitation study, we uncovered user needs for diversity in image generation. A pilot validation showed that Varif.ai made achieving diverse image sets easier. In a controlled evaluation with 20 participants, Varif.ai proved more effective than baseline methods across various scenarios. Thus, this supports user control of diversity in image generation for creative ideation and scalable image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>DIS20...</summary><p>DIS2025, code available at github.com/mario-michelessa/varifai</p></details> | [Code Link](http://github.com/mario-michelessa/varifai) |

However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model) considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\epsilon, \delta)$-unlearning guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of our approach. To show comparable performance with retrained model, we also show the comparison of a simple AutoEncoder on various baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02514v4)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image AutoRegressive generation has emerged as a new powerful paradigm with image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for a higher generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance. We release the code at https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars for reproducibility.</p></details> | Accepted at ICML2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars) |

Recent works suggest synthetic data as an alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data. Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets, enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11% reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a 10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy.

In this paper, we argue that the static FR strategy, predominantly adopted in prior literature for evaluating AFR efficacy, cannot faithfully characterize the actual capabilities of determined trackers who aim to track a specific target identity. In particular, we introduce DynTracker, a dynamic FR strategy where the model's gallery database is iteratively updated with newly recognized target identity images. Surprisingly, such a simple approach renders all the existing AFR protections ineffective. To mitigate the privacy threats posed by DynTracker, we advocate for explicitly promoting diversity in the AFR-protected images. We hypothesize that the lack of diversity is the primary cause of the failure of existing AFR methods. Specifically, we develop DivTrackee, a novel method for crafting diverse AFR protections that builds upon a text-guided image generation framework and diversity-promoting adversarial losses. Through comprehensive experiments on various image benchmarks and feature extractors, we demonstrate DynTracker's strength in breaking existing AFR methods and the superiority of DivTrackee in preventing user facial images from being identified by dynamic FR strategies. We believe our work can act as an important initial step towards developing more effective AFR methods for protecting user facial privacy against determined trackers.</p></details> |  | None |

A Survey of Utility and Privacy of Synthetic Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19360v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs) as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security '25). 21 pages, plus a 6-page appendix</p></details> | None |

While remarkable progress has been made in image generation and style transfer, the underlying mechanisms and aesthetic implications of these technologies remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AIGC technologies in visual arts, tracing their evolution from early algorithmic frameworks to contemporary deep generative models. We identify three pivotal paradigms: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models, and examine their roles in bridging the gap between human creativity and machine synthesis. To support our analysis, we systematically review over 500 research papers published in the past decade, spanning both foundational developments and state-of-the-art innovations. Furthermore, we propose a multidimensional evaluation framework that incorporates Technical Innovation, Artistic Merit, Visual Quality, Computational Efficiency, and Creative Potential. Our findings reveal both the transformative capacities and current limitations of AIGC systems, emphasizing their profound impact on the future of creative practices. Through this extensive synthesis, we offer a unified perspective on the convergence of artificial intelligence and artistic expression, while outlining key challenges and promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | 32 pages | None |

In this paper, we introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens, we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics. Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines in both automated evaluations and human studies.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we explore how generative models can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for zero-shot multi-object perception.

While the linear-complexity Mamba model emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards 2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future exploration.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for spatio-temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia.

An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p></details> |  | None |

Owing to massive and diverse information conveyed in real images, it is challenging for text-to-image generative models to synthesize informative training data with hand-crafted prompts. Considering the impressive ability of large generative models, could such models directly synthesize good training images for prediction tasks with proper prompts? We offer an affirmative response to this question by proposing a simple yet effective method, validated through ImageNet classification. Specifically, we caption each real image with the advanced captioning model to obtain informative and faithful prompts that extract class-relevant information and clarify the polysemy of class names. The image captions and class names are concatenated to prompt generative models for training image synthesis. We show that this simple caption incorporation significantly boosts the informativeness of synthetic data therefore enhancing downstream model generalization. More importantly, besides improvements in data augmentation and privacy preservation, our experiments demonstrate that synthesized images can exceed real data in terms of out-of-distribution robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 2 figure, 15 tables.

Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast, VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Auto-Regressively Generating Multi-View Consistent Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18527v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR) method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the "Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading diffusion-based multi-view image generation models.

However, the impact of technical factors on these images can pose challenges for reliable AI applications in ophthalmology. For example, large fundus cohorts are often confounded by factors like camera type, bearing the risk of learning shortcuts rather than the causal relationships behind the image generation process. Here, we introduce a population model for retinal fundus images that effectively disentangles patient attributes from camera effects, enabling controllable and highly realistic image generation. To achieve this, we propose a disentanglement loss based on distance correlation. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that our models encode desired information in disentangled subspaces and enable controllable image generation based on the learned subspaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of our disentanglement loss.

For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios, relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation, and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation. Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions, incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this, we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation from natural language.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse, including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence, discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications, this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants: PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics, effectively balancing safety and usability.</p></details> |  | None |

LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system and a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as input and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG's key challenge is that due to the projector's physical brightness limitation and the surface texture, the viewer's perceived projection may suffer from color saturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with the state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see clear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector image that follows the user's instruction while also displaying minimum surface artifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection surface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We first train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and project-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector image without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast convergence. Then, we design content and saturation losses to guide the projector image generation, such that the generated image shows no clearly perceivable artifacts when projected. Finally, the generated image is projected for visually pleasing surface style morphing effects. The source code and video are available on the project page: https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG/.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG) |
| **[Morse: Dual-Sampling for Lossless Acceleration of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18251v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies. Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type, but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image synthesis.

These methods typically convert images into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism, which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics, spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

To democratize these capabilities, we present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and 46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities. Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor, Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably, it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8 A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lengthy denoising process and complex neural networks hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Quantization can effectively reduce model complexity, and post-training quantization (PTQ), which does not require fine-tuning, is highly promising for compressing and accelerating diffusion models. Unfortunately, we find that due to the highly dynamic activations, existing PTQ methods suffer from distribution mismatch issues at both calibration sample level and reconstruction output level, which makes the performance far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose EDA-DM, a standardized PTQ method that efficiently addresses the above issues. Specifically, at the calibration sample level, we extract information from the density and diversity of latent space feature maps, which guides the selection of calibration samples to align with the overall sample distribution; and at the reconstruction output level, we theoretically analyze the reasons for previous reconstruction failures and, based on this insight, optimize block reconstruction using the Hessian loss of layers, aligning the outputs of quantized model and full-precision model at different network granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDA-DM significantly outperforms the existing PTQ methods across various models and datasets. Our method achieves a 1.83 times speedup and 4 times compression for the popular Stable-Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.05 loss in CLIP score.

However, fully synthetic datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations, such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy.

| **[Leveraging Model Guidance to Extract Training Data from Personalized Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03039v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models (DMs) have become powerful image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small image set to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases.

Traditional approaches, however, are hindered by arduous manual annotation and data collection, struggling to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an innovative automated end-to-end pipeline that revolutionizes object detection workflows from data collection to model evaluation. It eliminates the need for laborious human labeling and extensive data collection while achieving outstanding accuracy across diverse scenarios. DART encompasses four key stages: (1) Data Diversification using subject-driven image generation (DreamBooth with SDXL), (2) Annotation via open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) to generate bounding box and class labels, (3) Review of generated images and pseudo-labels by large multimodal models (InternVL-1.5 and GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility, and (4) Training of real-time object detectors (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) using the verified data. We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current instantiation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Its modular design ensures easy exchangeability and extensibility, allowing for future algorithm upgrades, seamless integration of new object categories, and adaptability to customized environments without manual labeling and additional data collection.

For precise control of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules. Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously. Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[Can Generated Images Serve as a Viable Modality for Text-Centric Multimodal Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17623v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant ``modality gap" exists between the abundance of text-only data and the increasing power of multimodal models. This work systematically investigates whether images generated on-the-fly by Text-to-Image (T2I) models can serve as a valuable complementary modality for text-centric tasks. Through a comprehensive evaluation framework on text classification, we analyze the impact of critical variables, including T2I model quality, prompt engineering strategies, and multimodal fusion architectures. Our findings demonstrate that this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent ``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm, providing a clear analysis of its potential and current limitations, and demonstrating its viability as a pathway to enrich language understanding in traditionally unimodal scenarios.</p></details> | 4 figures,7 tables | None |

To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Machine Mental Imagery: Empower Multimodal Reasoning with Latent Visual Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17218v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vlm-mirage.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Existing methods leverage rich image priors from pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design, we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yukun-huang.github.io/DreamCube/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yukun-huang.github.io/DreamCube) |

In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation. Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution. U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality images also being among the most energy efficient ones.</p></details> |  | None |

While such models are widely adopted, there is a limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2 ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding names like Frankfort or Devon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reward-Agnostic Prompt Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16853v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget, achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning.

However, current approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets, outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models, diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention (NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer, forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images.

The quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance. Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we tackle the challenge of automated slide generation, where models produce slide presentations from natural language (NL) instructions. We first introduce the SlidesBench benchmark, the first benchmark for slide generation with 7k training and 585 testing examples derived from 310 slide decks across 10 domains. SlidesBench supports evaluations that are (i)reference-based to measure similarity to a target slide, and (ii)reference-free to measure the design quality of generated slides alone. We benchmark end-to-end image generation and program generation methods with a variety of models, and find that programmatic methods produce higher-quality slides in user-interactable formats. Built on the success of program generation, we create AutoPresent, an 8B Llama-based model trained on 7k pairs of instructions paired with code for slide generation, and achieve results comparable to the closed-source model GPT-4o. We further explore iterative design refinement where the model is tasked to self-refine its own output, and we found that this process improves the slide's quality. We hope that our work will provide a basis for future work on generating structured visuals.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/wmar</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/wmar) |

In contrast, data-driven generative models do not have explicit physical parameters pre-determined, and instead learn them efficiently from observational data, making them alternative solutions to galaxy generation. Among these, diffusion models outperform Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in quality and diversity. Leveraging physical prior knowledge to these models can further enhance their capabilities. In this work, we present GalCatDiff, the first framework in astronomy to leverage both galaxy image features and astrophysical properties in the network design of diffusion models. GalCatDiff incorporates an enhanced U-Net and a novel block entitled Astro-RAB (Residual Attention Block), which dynamically combines attention mechanisms with convolution operations to ensure global consistency and local feature fidelity. Moreover, GalCatDiff uses category embeddings for class-specific galaxy generation, avoiding the high computational costs of training separate models for each category. Our experimental results demonstrate that GalCatDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of the consistency of sample color and size distributions, and the generated galaxies are both visually realistic and physically consistent. This framework will enhance the reliability of galaxy simulations and can potentially serve as a data augmentor to support future galaxy classification algorithm development.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures.

To address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)** technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**, achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to **2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://a-suozhang.xyz/paroattn.github.io</p></details> | None |

However, it is increasingly evident that image generation is political, contributing to broader social struggles over visual meaning. This sociopolitical aspect was highlighted by the March 2024 Gemini controversy, where Gemini faced criticism for inappropriately injecting demographic diversity into user prompts. Although the developers sought to redress image generation's sociopolitical dimension by introducing diversity "corrections," their opaque imposition of a standard for "diversity" ultimately proved counterproductive. In this paper, we present an alternative approach: an image generation interface designed to embrace open negotiation along the sociopolitical dimensions of image creation. Grounded in the principles of agonistic pluralism (from the Greek agon, meaning struggle), our interface actively engages users with competing visual interpretations of their prompts. Through a lab study with 29 participants, we evaluate our agonistic interface on its ability to facilitate reflection - engagement with other perspectives and challenging dominant assumptions - a core principle that underpins agonistic contestation. We compare it to three existing paradigms: a standard interface, a Gemini-style interface that produces "diverse" images, and an intention-centric interface suggesting prompt refinements. Our findings demonstrate that the agonistic interface enhances reflection across multiple measures, but also that reflection depends on users perceiving the interface as both appropriate and empowering; introducing diversity without grounding it in relevant political contexts was perceived as inauthentic. Our results suggest that diversity and user intention should not be treated as opposing values to be balanced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Fairness, Accountability, Transparency 2025 -- Athens, Greece</p></details> | None |

Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this insight, we propose UniWorld-V1, a unified generative framework built upon semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld-V1 achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source the UniWorld-V1 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Origins of Creativity in Attention-Based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17324v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how `creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g., (Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process. However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself (translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise `mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Although powerful, we identify three fundamental design problems with existing tooling through a literature review. We introduce a multimodal generative AI tool, DeckFlow, to address these problems. First, DeckFlow supports task decomposition by allowing users to maintain multiple interconnected subtasks on an infinite canvas populated by cards connected through visual dataflow affordances. Second, DeckFlow supports a specification decomposition workflow where an initial goal is iteratively decomposed into smaller parts and combined using feature labels and clusters. Finally, DeckFlow supports generative space exploration by generating multiple prompt and output variations, presented in a grid, that can feed back recursively into the next design iteration. We evaluate DeckFlow for text-to-image generation against a state-of-practice conversational AI baseline for image generation tasks. We then add audio generation and investigate user behaviors in a more open-ended creative setting with text, image, and audio outputs.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x.

| **[Control and Realism: Best of Both Worlds in Layout-to-Image without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15563v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 | None |

However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).</p></details> |  | None |

The model generates novel output views by incorporating semantic context from text and image inputs. Using a simple sequence concatenation approach, FLUX.1 Kontext handles both local editing and generative in-context tasks within a single unified architecture. Compared to current editing models that exhibit degradation in character consistency and stability across multiple turns, we observe that FLUX.1 Kontext improved preservation of objects and characters, leading to greater robustness in iterative workflows.The model achieves competitive performance with current state-of-the-art systems while delivering significantly faster generation times, enabling interactive applications and rapid prototyping workflows. To validate these improvements, we introduce KontextBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 1026 image-prompt pairs covering five task categories: local editing, global editing, character reference, style reference and text editing. Detailed evaluations show the superior performance of FLUX.1 Kontext in terms of both single-turn quality and multi-turn consistency, setting new standards for unified image processing models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Frequency-Calibrated Membership Inference Attacks on Medical Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14919v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.</p></details> | 59 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Cost-Aware Routing for Efficient Text-To-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14753v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are well known for their ability to generate a high-fidelity image for an input prompt through an iterative denoising process. Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Align Your Flow: Scaling Continuous-Time Flow Map Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14603v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion- and flow-based models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative modeling approaches, but they require many sampling steps. Consistency models can distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike flow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when increasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and empirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise levels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this paper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, along with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing consistency and flow matching objectives. We further demonstrate that autoguidance can improve performance, using a low-quality model for guidance during distillation, and an additional boost can be achieved by adversarial finetuning, with minimal loss in sample diversity. We extensively validate our flow map models, called Align Your Flow, on challenging image generation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on both ImageNet 64x64 and 512x512, using small and efficient neural networks. Finally, we show text-to-image flow map models that outperform all existing non-adversarially trained few-step samplers in text-conditioned synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/AlignYourFlow/</p></details> | None |
| **[Risk Estimation of Knee Osteoarthritis Progression via Predictive Multi-task Modelling from Efficient Diffusion Model using X-ray Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14560v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical imaging plays a crucial role in assessing knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk by enabling early detection and disease monitoring. Recent machine learning methods have improved risk estimation (i.e., predicting the likelihood of disease progression) and predictive modelling (i.e., the forecasting of future outcomes based on current data) using medical images, but clinical adoption remains limited due to their lack of interpretability. Existing approaches that generate future images for risk estimation are complex and impractical. Additionally, previous methods fail to localize anatomical knee landmarks, limiting interpretability. We address these gaps with a new interpretable machine learning method to estimate the risk of knee OA progression via multi-task predictive modelling that classifies future knee OA severity and predicts anatomical knee landmarks from efficiently generated high-quality future images. Such image generation is achieved by leveraging a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to forecast disease progression, offering a visual representation of how particular health conditions may evolve. Applied to the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset, our approach improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 2\%, achieving an AUC of 0.71 in predicting knee OA progression while offering ~9% faster inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

By utilizing a small set of user-provided examples featuring the same subject, PCS aims to tailor this subject to specific user-defined prompts. Over the past two years, more than 150 methods have been introduced in this area. However, existing surveys primarily focus on text-to-image generation, with few providing up-to-date summaries on PCS. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of PCS, introducing the general frameworks of PCS research, which can be categorized into test-time fine-tuning (TTF) and pre-trained adaptation (PTA) approaches. We analyze the strengths, limitations, and key techniques of these methodologies. Additionally, we explore specialized tasks within the field, such as object, face, and style personalization, while highlighting their unique challenges and innovations. Despite the promising progress, we also discuss ongoing challenges, including overfitting and the trade-off between subject fidelity and text alignment. Through this detailed overview and analysis, we propose future directions to further the development of PCS.</p></details> |  | None |

Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation via classifier-free guidance (CFG). However, standard CFG applies a single global weight across all conditioning variables, which can lead to poor identity preservation and spurious attribute changes - a phenomenon known as attribute amplification. To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces group-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition attributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply distinct guidance to each. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, MIMIC-CXR, and EMBED show that DCFG improves intervention fidelity, mitigates unintended changes, and enhances reversibility, enabling more faithful and interpretable counterfactual image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a novel training framework that interprets neural network blocks as performing denoising operations in a continuous-time diffusion process. By partitioning the network into independently trainable blocks and optimizing noise level assignments based on equal cumulative probability mass, our approach achieves significant memory efficiency while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional backpropagation in generative tasks. Experiments on image generation and language modeling tasks demonstrate memory reduction proportional to the number of blocks while achieving superior performance. DiffusionBlocks provides a promising pathway for democratizing access to large-scale neural network training with limited computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at TTODLer-FM Workshop of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> | None |

Despite ongoing efforts, the research community still lacks a large-scale and reasoning capability driven deepfake benchmark dataset specifically tailored for person-centric object, context and scene manipulations. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MultiFakeVerse, a large scale person-centric deepfake dataset, comprising 845,286 images generated through manipulation suggestions and image manipulations both derived from vision-language models (VLM). The VLM instructions were specifically targeted towards modifications to individuals or contextual elements of a scene that influence human perception of importance, intent, or narrative. This VLM-driven approach enables semantic, context-aware alterations such as modifying actions, scenes, and human-object interactions rather than synthetic or low-level identity swaps and region-specific edits that are common in existing datasets. Our experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art deepfake detection models and human observers struggle to detect these subtle yet meaningful manipulations.

However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details) during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes, thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the original model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A robust and scalable framework for hallucination detection in virtual tissue staining and digital pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18458v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential for disease diagnosis. Recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in traditional histochemical staining processes, permitting multiplexed staining and tissue preservation. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical uses of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images by experts can be subjective. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method, AQuA, for virtual tissue staining and digital pathology. AQuA autonomously achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to histochemically stained ground truth, and presents an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists, including identifying realistic-looking images that could mislead diagnosticians. We demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained human tissue images. This framework enhances the reliability of virtual tissue staining and provides autonomous quality assurance for image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 Pa...</summary><p>45 Pages, 22 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> | None |

However, it is sensitive to the choice of augmentation pipeline. Positive pairs should preserve semantic information while destroying domain-specific information. Standard augmentation pipelines emulate domain-specific changes with pre-defined photometric transformations, but what if we could simulate realistic domain changes instead? In this work, we show how to utilise recent progress in counterfactual image generation to this effect. We propose CF-SimCLR, a counterfactual contrastive learning approach which leverages approximate counterfactual inference for positive pair creation. Comprehensive evaluation across five datasets, on chest radiography and mammography, demonstrates that CF-SimCLR substantially improves robustness to acquisition shift with higher downstream performance on both in- and out-of-distribution data, particularly for domains which are under-represented during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2025.103668.

However, due to the densely populated farming environment, flatfish are susceptible to lesions and diseases, making early lesion detection crucial. Traditionally, lesions were detected through visual inspection, but observing large numbers of fish is challenging. Automated approaches based on deep learning technologies have been widely used to address this problem, but accurate detection remains difficult due to the diversity of the fish and the lack of a fish lesion and disease dataset. This study augments fish lesion images using generative adversarial networks and image harmonization methods. Next, lesion detectors are trained separately for three body parts (head, fins, and body) to address individual lesions properly. Additionally, a flatfish lesion and disease image dataset, called FlatIMG, is created and verified using the proposed methods on the dataset. A flash salmon lesion dataset is also tested to validate the generalizability of the proposed methods. The results achieved 12% higher performance than the baseline framework. This study is the first attempt to create a high-quality flatfish lesion image dataset with detailed annotations and propose an effective lesion detection framework. Automatic lesion and disease monitoring can be achieved in farming environments using the proposed methods and dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 page, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Supervised detection relies on large, curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing the model's response with the phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29%. These gains are consistent for two widely used open-source models and across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects, and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations -- suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting. Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases -- indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

However, when a network is trained on a limited sample space, its generalization capability may be constrained, which degrades performance on unfamiliar data. For image generation tasks, this can lead to issues such as blurry details and inconsistencies between regions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Sinogram-based Wavelet random decomposition And Random mask diffusion Model (SWARM) for SVCT reconstruction. Specifically, introducing a random mask strategy in the sinogram effectively expands the limited training sample space. This enables the model to learn a broader range of data distributions, enhancing its understanding and generalization of data uncertainty. In addition, applying a random training strategy to the high-frequency components of the sinogram wavelet enhances feature representation and improves the ability to capture details in different frequency bands, thereby improving performance and robustness. Two-stage iterative reconstruction method is adopted to ensure the global consistency of the reconstructed image while refining its details. Experimental results demonstrate that SWARM outperforms competing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative performance across various datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AccDiffusion v2: Towards More Accurate Higher-Resolution Diffusion Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02099v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models suffer severe object repetition and local distortion when the inference resolution differs from its pre-trained resolution. We propose AccDiffusion v2, an accurate method for patch-wise higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation without training. Our in-depth analysis in this paper shows that using an identical text prompt for different patches leads to repetitive generation, while the absence of a prompt undermines image details. In response, our AccDiffusion v2 novelly decouples the vanilla image-content-aware prompt into a set of patch-content-aware prompts, each of which serves as a more precise description of a patch. Further analysis reveals that local distortion arises from inaccurate descriptions in prompts about the local structure of higher-resolution images. To address this issue, AccDiffusion v2, for the first time, introduces an auxiliary local structural information through ControlNet during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation aiming to mitigate the local distortions. Finally, our analysis indicates that global semantic information is conducive to suppressing both repetitive generation and local distortion. Hence, our AccDiffusion v2 further proposes dilated sampling with window interaction for better global semantic information during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation. We conduct extensive experiments, including both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, to demonstrate the efficacy of our AccDiffusion v2. The quantitative comparison shows that AccDiffusion v2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation extrapolation without training. The qualitative comparison intuitively illustrates that AccDiffusion v2 effectively suppresses the issues of repetitive generation and local distortion in image generation extrapolation.

| **[ID-Booth: Identity-consistent Face Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07392v5)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner.

However, HDR increases data demands, posing challenges for bandwidth efficiency and compression techniques. Advances in compression and display technologies require more precise image quality assessment, particularly in the high-fidelity range where perceptual differences are subtle. To address this gap, we introduce AIC-HDR2025, the first such HDR dataset, comprising 100 test images generated from five HDR sources, each compressed using four codecs at five compression levels. It covers the high-fidelity range, from visible distortions to compression levels below the visually lossless threshold. A subjective study was conducted using the JPEG AIC-3 test methodology, combining plain and boosted triplet comparisons. In total, 34,560 ratings were collected from 151 participants across four fully controlled labs. The results confirm that AIC-3 enables precise HDR quality estimation, with 95\% confidence intervals averaging a width of 0.27 at 1 JND. In addition, several recently proposed objective metrics were evaluated based on their correlation with subjective ratings.

To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.</p></details> |  | None |

It serves as an essential testing ground for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To advance this field, we introduced a new REC dataset in our previous conference paper, characterized by two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring multi-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and multi-hop relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing and augmentation, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject scenarios where the target object is absent, an often overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. In this extended work, we propose two new methods to tackle the challenges of fine-grained REC by combining the strengths of Specialist Models and MLLMs. The first method adaptively assigns simple cases to faster, lightweight models and reserves complex ones for powerful MLLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The second method lets a specialist generate a set of possible object regions, and the MLLM selects the most plausible one using its reasoning ability. These collaborative strategies lead to significant improvements on our dataset and other challenging benchmarks. Our results show that combining specialized and general-purpose models offers a practical path toward solving complex real-world vision-language tasks.

Unlike diffusion models, AR models enable more efficient and controllable generation with faster inference times, making them especially suitable for data-intensive domains. Traditional 3D generative models using AR approaches often rely on ``next-token" predictions at the voxel or point level. While effective for certain applications, these methods can be restrictive and computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale 3D data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce 3D-WAG, an AR model for 3D implicit distance fields that can perform unconditional shape generation, class-conditioned and also text-conditioned shape generation. Our key idea is to encode shapes as multi-scale wavelet token maps and use a Transformer to predict the ``next higher-resolution token map" in an autoregressive manner. By redefining 3D AR generation task as ``next-scale" prediction, we reduce the computational cost of generation compared to traditional ``next-token" prediction models, while preserving essential geometric details of 3D shapes in a more structured and hierarchical manner. We evaluate 3D-WAG to showcase its benefit by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on widely used benchmarks. Our results show 3D-WAG achieves superior performance in key metrics like Coverage and MMD, generating high-fidelity 3D shapes that closely match the real data distribution.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite rapid advancements in generative AI for real-world imagery, medical domain evaluations have been hindered by methodological inconsistencies, outdated architectural comparisons, and disconnected assessment criteria that rarely address the practical clinical value of synthetic samples. CheXGenBench overcomes these limitations through standardised data partitioning and a unified evaluation protocol comprising over 20 quantitative metrics that systematically analyse generation quality, potential privacy vulnerabilities, and downstream clinical applicability across 11 leading text-to-image architectures. Our results reveal critical inefficiencies in the existing evaluation protocols, particularly in assessing generative fidelity, leading to inconsistent and uninformative comparisons. Our framework establishes a standardised benchmark for the medical AI community, enabling objective and reproducible comparisons while facilitating seamless integration of both existing and future generative models. Additionally, we release a high-quality, synthetic dataset, SynthCheX-75K, comprising 75K radiographs generated by the top-performing model (Sana 0.6B) in our benchmark to support further research in this critical domain. Through CheXGenBench, we establish a new state-of-the-art and release our framework, models, and SynthCheX-75K dataset at https://raman1121.github.io/CheXGenBench/</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://raman1121.github.io/CheXGenBench) |

Deep generative models offer a promising solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However, unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging, which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published and presented at the MIUA 2025 conference</p></details> | None |

In CVTG, image generation models often rendering distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while introducing the novel multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. By leveraging a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, Ming-Lite-Uni enables native multimodal AR models to perform both text-to-image generation and instruction based image editing tasks, expanding their capabilities beyond pure visual understanding.

However, the potential for misuse, such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy image synthesis.</p></details> | Technical report | None |

Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers 4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines, 6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams, and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated knowledge image-prompt pairs.</p></details> |  | None |

Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences. Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of 30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence, collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of a manuscript submitted to ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI), under review. 39 pages, 4 figures</p></details> | None |

Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models excel in efficiency and plug directly into the transformer ecosystem, delivering robust generalization, predictable scalability, and seamless workflows such as fine-tuning and parallelized training. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features for expressivity, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation, especially the success of visual autoregressive methods, we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrated the potential of this method, achieving inference speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving high-quality generation.</p></details> | Camera-ready version | None |
| **[Symmetrical Flow Matching: Unified Image Generation, Segmentation, and Classification with Score-Based Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10634v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures | None |

While CLIP is capable of making image features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI. Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR, T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications. We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360 enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for 2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets, enabling customizable 3D content creation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |

Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities.

However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset.

Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce Sparc3D, a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes representation Sparcubes with a novel encoder Sparconv-VAE. Sparcubes converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse cube, allowing differentiable optimization. Sparconv-VAE is the first modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion. Sparc3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs, including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry.

Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction of DataSeeds.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development.

However, medical LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM training framework. In combination, these strategies enable pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%.

In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages.

| **[GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems, underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries. Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters, while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts. Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety weaknesses.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Spectral Image Tokenizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09607v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image tokenizers map images to sequences of discrete tokens, and are a crucial component of autoregressive transformer-based image generation. The tokens are typically associated with spatial locations in the input image, arranged in raster scan order, which is not ideal for autoregressive modeling. In this paper, we propose to tokenize the image spectrum instead, obtained from a discrete wavelet transform (DWT), such that the sequence of tokens represents the image in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Our tokenizer brings several advantages: 1) it leverages that natural images are more compressible at high frequencies, 2) it can take and reconstruct images of different resolutions without retraining, 3) it improves the conditioning for next-token prediction -- instead of conditioning on a partial line-by-line reconstruction of the image, it takes a coarse reconstruction of the full image, 4) it enables partial decoding where the first few generated tokens can reconstruct a coarse version of the image, 5) it enables autoregressive models to be used for image upsampling. We evaluate the tokenizer reconstruction metrics as well as multiscale image generation, text-guided image upsampling and editing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Canonical Latent Representations in Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09955v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM features preserve essential categorical information while discarding non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that can drive robust representation learning.</p></details> | 45 pages,41 figures | None |

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 4 Pages, 5 Figures | None |

State-of-the-art methods aiming for style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances, consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content leakage.</p></details> |  | None |

While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages excluding supplementary</p></details> | None |

T cell receptors (TCRs), crucial proteins in the immune system, play a key role in recognizing antigens, including those associated with cancer. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have facilitated comprehensive profiling of TCR repertoires, uncovering TCRs with potent anti-cancer activity and enabling TCR-based immunotherapies. However, analyzing these intricate biomolecules necessitates efficient representations that capture their structural and functional information. T-cell protein sequences pose unique challenges due to their relatively smaller lengths compared to other biomolecules. An image-based representation approach becomes a preferred choice for efficient embeddings, allowing for the preservation of essential details and enabling comprehensive analysis of T-cell protein sequences. In this paper, we propose to generate images from the protein sequences using the idea of Chaos Game Representation (CGR) using the Kaleidoscopic images approach. This Deep Learning Assisted Analysis of Protein Sequences Using Chaos Enhanced Kaleidoscopic Images (called DANCE) provides a unique way to visualize protein sequences by recursively applying chaos game rules around a central seed point. we perform the classification of the T cell receptors (TCRs) protein sequences in terms of their respective target cancer cells, as TCRs are known for their immune response against cancer disease. The TCR sequences are converted into images using the DANCE method. We employ deep-learning vision models to perform the classification to obtain insights into the relationship between the visual patterns observed in the generated kaleidoscopic images and the underlying protein properties. By combining CGR-based image generation with deep learning classification, this study opens novel possibilities in the protein analysis domain.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DGAE: Diffusion-Guided Autoencoder for Efficient Latent Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09644v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Consistent Story Generation with Asymmetry Zigzag Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09612v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories. The code is available at https://github.com/Mingxiao-Li/Asymmetry-Zigzag-StoryDiffusion.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9. figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Mingxiao-Li/Asymmetry-Zigzag-StoryDiffusion) |

In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09416v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes. Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAGE: Exploring the Boundaries of Unsafe Concept Domain with Semantic-Augment Erasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09363v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it, trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs. The code and weights will be open-sourced at https://github.com/KevinLight831/SAGE.</p></details> | Under review | [Code Link](https://github.com/KevinLight831/SAGE) |

Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.</p></details> | 18 pages,8 figures | None |
| **[Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |

Typically, diffusion models are trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus limited unbiased data across diffusion times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> | None |
| **[Bias Analysis in Unconditional Image Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09106v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges - especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex nature of attributes when evaluating bias.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks.

These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and has been publicly released.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR) |
