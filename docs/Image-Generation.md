| **[CineVerse: Consistent Keyframe Synthesis for Cinematic Scene Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19894v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CineVerse, a novel framework for the task of cinematic scene composition. Similar to traditional multi-shot generation, our task emphasizes the need for consistency and continuity across frames. However, our task also focuses on addressing challenges inherent to filmmaking, such as multiple characters, complex interactions, and visual cinematic effects. In order to learn to generate such content, we first create the CineVerse dataset. We use this dataset to train our proposed two-stage approach. First, we prompt a large language model (LLM) with task-specific instructions to take in a high-level scene description and generate a detailed plan for the overall setting and characters, as well as the individual shots. Then, we fine-tune a text-to-image generation model to synthesize high-quality visual keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that CineVerse yields promising improvements in generating visually coherent and contextually rich movie scenes, paving the way for further exploration in cinematic video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>link ...</summary><p>link website: https://cinevers.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[HepatoGEN: Generating Hepatobiliary Phase MRI with Perceptual and Adversarial Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18405v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information. However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

| **[TextTIGER: Text-based Intelligent Generation with Entity Prompt Refinement for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18269v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating images from prompts containing specific entities requires models to retain as much entity-specific knowledge as possible. However, fully memorizing such knowledge is impractical due to the vast number of entities and their continuous emergence. To address this, we propose Text-based Intelligent Generation with Entity prompt Refinement (TextTIGER), which augments knowledge on entities included in the prompts and then summarizes the augmented descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate performance degradation from longer inputs. To evaluate our method, we introduce WiT-Cub (WiT with Captions and Uncomplicated Background-explanations), a dataset comprising captions, images, and an entity list. Experiments on four image generation models and five LLMs show that TextTIGER improves image generation performance in standard metrics (IS, FID, and CLIPScore) compared to caption-only prompts. Additionally, multiple annotators' evaluation confirms that the summarized descriptions are more informative, validating LLMs' ability to generate concise yet rich descriptions. These findings demonstrate that refining prompts with augmented and summarized entity-related descriptions enhances image generation capabilities. The code and dataset will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Optimizing Multi-Round Enhanced Training in Diffusion Models for Improved Preference Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18204v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has significantly changed industries by enabling text-driven image generation, yet challenges remain in achieving high-resolution outputs that align with fine-grained user preferences. Consequently, multi-round interactions are necessary to ensure the generated images meet expectations. Previous methods enhanced prompts via reward feedback but did not optimize over a multi-round dialogue dataset. In this work, we present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, leveraging a well-trained reward model aligned with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, our framework applies multiple reward functions, such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback, while fine-tuning the diffusion model through LoRA, thus optimizing image generation based on user input. We also construct multi-round dialogue datasets of prompts and image pairs aligned with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving image consistency and alignment with user intent. Our approach consistently surpasses competing models in user satisfaction, especially in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.17660</p></details> | None |
| **[Diffusion-Driven Universal Model Inversion Attack for Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18015v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial recognition technology poses significant privacy risks, as it relies on biometric data that is inherently sensitive and immutable if compromised. To mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search, enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs based solely on embeddings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Importance-Based Token Merging for Efficient Image and Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16720v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token merging can effectively accelerate various vision systems by processing groups of similar tokens only once and sharing the results across them. However, existing token grouping methods are often ad hoc and random, disregarding the actual content of the samples. We show that preserving high-information tokens during merging - those essential for semantic fidelity and structural details - significantly improves sample quality, producing finer details and more coherent, realistic generations. Despite being simple and intuitive, this approach remains underexplored. To do so, we propose an importance-based token merging method that prioritizes the most critical tokens in computational resource allocation, leveraging readily available importance scores, such as those from classifier-free guidance in diffusion models. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple applications, including text-to-image synthesis, multi-view image generation, and video generation with various model architectures such as Stable Diffusion, Zero123++, AnimateDiff, or PixArt-$\alpha$.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast Autoregressive Models for Continuous Latent Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18391v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data generation, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image generation presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked autoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token distributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow inference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a novel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut head, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive principles. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers, extending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves $2.3\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS scores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for high-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap between quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FashionM3: Multimodal, Multitask, and Multiround Fashion Assistant based on Unified Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17826v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fashion styling and personalized recommendations are pivotal in modern retail, contributing substantial economic value in the fashion industry. With the advent of vision-language models (VLM), new opportunities have emerged to enhance retailing through natural language and visual interactions. This work proposes FashionM3, a multimodal, multitask, and multiround fashion assistant, built upon a VLM fine-tuned for fashion-specific tasks. It helps users discover satisfying outfits by offering multiple capabilities including personalized recommendation, alternative suggestion, product image generation, and virtual try-on simulation. Fine-tuned on the novel FashionRec dataset, comprising 331,124 multimodal dialogue samples across basic, personalized, and alternative recommendation tasks, FashionM3 delivers contextually personalized suggestions with iterative refinement through multiround interactions. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, alongside user studies, demonstrate FashionM3's superior performance in recommendation effectiveness and practical value as a fashion assistant.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Token-Shuffle: Towards High-Resolution Image Generation with Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17789v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generative Fields: Uncovering Hierarchical Feature Control for StyleGAN via Inverted Receptive Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17712v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>StyleGAN has demonstrated the ability of GANs to synthesize highly-realistic faces of imaginary people from random noise. One limitation of GAN-based image generation is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated image, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space. Previous work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts modulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent space. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not control the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space requires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its application. This paper introduces the concept of "generative fields" to explain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the receptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we propose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory and the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural feature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at synthesis time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Synthetic Positives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16965v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning with the nearest neighbor has proved to be one of the most efficient self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques by utilizing the similarity of multiple instances within the same class. However, its efficacy is constrained as the nearest neighbor algorithm primarily identifies "easy" positive pairs, where the representations are already closely located in the embedding space. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Contrastive Learning with Synthetic Positives (CLSP) that utilizes synthetic images, generated by an unconditional diffusion model, as the additional positives to help the model learn from diverse positives. Through feature interpolation in the diffusion model sampling process, we generate images with distinct backgrounds yet similar semantic content to the anchor image. These images are considered "hard" positives for the anchor image, and when included as supplementary positives in the contrastive loss, they contribute to a performance improvement of over 2% and 1% in linear evaluation compared to the previous NNCLR and All4One methods across multiple benchmark datasets such as CIFAR10, achieving state-of-the-art methods. On transfer learning benchmarks, CLSP outperforms existing SSL frameworks on 6 out of 8 downstream datasets. We believe CLSP establishes a valuable baseline for future SSL studies incorporating synthetic data in the training process.</p></details> | 8 pages, conference | None |
| **[STCL:Curriculum learning Strategies for deep learning image steganography models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17609v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis scores.

| **[Text-to-Image Alignment in Denoising-Based Models through Step Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17525v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generative AI models often encounter challenges related to text-image alignment and reasoning limitations. This paper presents a novel method for selectively enhancing the signal at critical denoising steps, optimizing image generation based on input semantics. Our approach addresses the shortcomings of early-stage signal modifications, demonstrating that adjustments made at later stages yield superior results. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method in producing semantically aligned images on Diffusion and Flow Matching model, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our results highlight the importance of a judicious choice of sampling stage to improve performance and overall image alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RefVNLI: Towards Scalable Evaluation of Subject-driven Text-to-image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17502v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to produce images that align with a given textual description, while preserving the visual identity from a referenced subject image. Despite its broad downstream applicability -- ranging from enhanced personalization in image generation to consistent character representation in video rendering -- progress in this field is limited by the lack of reliable automatic evaluation. Existing methods either assess only one aspect of the task (i.e., textual alignment or subject preservation), misalign with human judgments, or rely on costly API-based evaluation. To address this, we introduce RefVNLI, a cost-effective metric that evaluates both textual alignment and subject preservation in a single prediction. Trained on a large-scale dataset derived from video-reasoning benchmarks and image perturbations, RefVNLI outperforms or matches existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and subject categories (e.g., \emph{Animal}, \emph{Object}), achieving up to 6.4-point gains in textual alignment and 8.5-point gains in subject consistency. It also excels with lesser-known concepts, aligning with human preferences at over 87\% accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StereoMamba: Real-time and Robust Intraoperative Stereo Disparity Estimation via Long-range Spatial Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17401v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo disparity estimation is crucial for obtaining depth information in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). While current deep learning methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images (1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761), exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DRC: Enhancing Personalized Image Generation via Disentangled Representation Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17349v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics. To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Generalized and Training-Free Text-Guided Semantic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17269v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided semantic manipulation refers to semantically editing an image generated from a source prompt to match a target prompt, enabling the desired semantic changes (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) while preserving irrelevant contents. With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations (poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play) across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2) $\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in semantics manipulation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scene Perceived Image Perceptual Score (SPIPS): combining global and local perception for image quality assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17234v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and widespread use of smartphones have resulted in an exponential growth of image data, both real (camera-captured) and virtual (AI-generated). This surge underscores the critical need for robust image quality assessment (IQA) methods that accurately reflect human visual perception. Traditional IQA techniques primarily rely on spatial features - such as signal-to-noise ratio, local structural distortions, and texture inconsistencies - to identify artifacts. While effective for unprocessed or conventionally altered images, these methods fall short in the context of modern image post-processing powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). The rise of DNN-based models for image generation, enhancement, and restoration has significantly improved visual quality, yet made accurate assessment increasingly complex. To address this, we propose a novel IQA approach that bridges the gap between deep learning methods and human perception. Our model disentangles deep features into high-level semantic information and low-level perceptual details, treating each stream separately. These features are then combined with conventional IQA metrics to provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework. This hybrid design enables the model to assess both global context and intricate image details, better reflecting the human visual process, which first interprets overall structure before attending to fine-grained elements. The final stage employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to map the integrated features into a concise quality score. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves improved consistency with human perceptual judgments compared to existing IQA models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Distilling semantically aware orders for autoregressive image generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17069v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive results in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless, autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right) guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training costs and no extra annotations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reinforcement Learning With LLMs Interaction For Distributed Diffusion Model Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11094v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has attracted significant attention, but two key challenges remain: maximizing subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) and improving energy efficiency, which are particularly pronounced in widely adopted Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based image generation services. In this paper, we propose a novel user-centric Interactive AI (IAI) approach for service management, with a distributed GDM-based AIGC framework that emphasizes efficient and cooperative deployment. The proposed method restructures the GDM inference process by allowing users with semantically similar prompts to share parts of the denoising chain. Furthermore, to maximize the users' subjective QoE, we propose an IAI approach, i.e., Reinforcement Learning With Large Language Models Interaction (RLLI), which utilizes Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered generative agents to replicate user interaction, providing real-time and subjective QoE feedback aligned with diverse user personalities. Lastly, we present the GDM-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDDPG) algorithm, adapted to the proposed RLLI framework, to allocate communication and computing resources effectively while accounting for subjective user traits and dynamic wireless conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that G-DDPG improves total QoE by 15% compared with the standard DDPG algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pix2Next: Leveraging Vision Foundation Models for RGB to NIR Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16706v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes Pix2Next, a novel image-to-image translation framework designed to address the challenge of generating high-quality Near-Infrared (NIR) images from RGB inputs. Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.</p></details> | 19 pages,12 figures | None |
| **[CLPSTNet: A Progressive Multi-Scale Convolutional Steganography Model Integrating Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16364v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, a large number of works have introduced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into image steganography, which transform traditional steganography methods such as hand-crafted features and prior knowledge design into steganography methods that neural networks autonomically learn information embedding. However, due to the inherent complexity of digital images, issues of invisibility and security persist when using CNN models for information embedding. In this paper, we propose Curriculum Learning Progressive Steganophy Network (CLPSTNet). The network consists of multiple progressive multi-scale convolutional modules that integrate Inception structures and dilated convolutions. The module contains multiple branching pathways, starting from a smaller convolutional kernel and dilatation rate, extracting the basic, local feature information from the feature map, and gradually expanding to the convolution with a larger convolutional kernel and dilatation rate for perceiving the feature information of a larger receptive field, so as to realize the multi-scale feature extraction from shallow to deep, and from fine to coarse, allowing the shallow secret information features to be refined in different fusion stages. The experimental results show that the proposed CLPSTNet not only has high PSNR , SSIM metrics and decoding accuracy on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, but also the steganographic images generated by CLPSTNet have low steganalysis scores.You can find our code at \href{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet) |
| **[Learning Energy-Based Generative Models via Potential Flow: A Variational Principle Approach to Probability Density Homotopy Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16262v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy-based models (EBMs) are a powerful class of probabilistic generative models due to their flexibility and interpretability. However, relationships between potential flows and explicit EBMs remain underexplored, while contrastive divergence training via implicit Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is often unstable and expensive in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose Variational Potential Flow Bayes (VPFB), a new energy-based generative framework that eliminates the need for implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on auxiliary networks or cooperative training. VPFB learns an energy-parameterized potential flow by constructing a flow-driven density homotopy that is matched to the data distribution through a variational loss minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the flow-driven and marginal homotopies. This principled formulation enables robust and efficient generative modeling while preserving the interpretability of EBMs. Experimental results on image generation, interpolation, out-of-distribution detection, and compositional generation confirm the effectiveness of VPFB, showing that our method performs competitively with existing approaches in terms of sample quality and versatility across diverse generative modeling tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> | None |

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Generative Image Modeling via Joint Image-Feature Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16064v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models (LDMs) dominate high-quality image generation, yet integrating representation learning with generative modeling remains a challenge. We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that seamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model low-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level semantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor employs semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated image. Additionally, our framework incorporates a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve geometry priors of reference subjects for robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrates that DualOptim contributes to effective and stable unlearning. Through extensive experiments, we show that DualOptim can significantly boost MU efficacy and stability across diverse tasks, including image classification, image generation, and large language models, making it a versatile approach to empower existing MU algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous efforts mainly concentrated on single-view generation, often resulting in inconsistencies across neighboring ground views. In this work, we propose a novel cross-view synthesis approach designed to overcome these challenges by ensuring consistency across ground-view images generated from satellite views. Our method, based on a fixed latent diffusion model, introduces two conditioning modules: satellite-guided denoising, which extracts high-level scene layout to guide the denoising process, and satellite-temporal denoising, which captures camera motion to maintain consistency across multiple generated views. We further contribute a large-scale satellite-ground dataset containing over 100,000 perspective pairs to facilitate extensive ground scene or video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on perceptual and temporal metrics, achieving high photorealism and consistency in multi-view outputs.</p></details> | 8 figures | None |
| **[On the Guidance of Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02150v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has shown state-of-the-art performance in various generative tasks, ranging from image generation to decision-making, where guided generation is pivotal. However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework.

While existing jailbreak studies primarily focus on VLMs' susceptibility to harmful instructions, we reveal a fundamental yet overlooked vulnerability: toxic text continuation, where VLMs produce highly toxic completions when prompted with harmful text prefixes paired with semantically adversarial images. To systematically study this threat, we propose Red Team Diffuser (RTD), the first red teaming diffusion model that coordinates adversarial image generation and toxic continuation through reinforcement learning. Our key innovations include dynamic cross-modal attack and stealth-aware optimization. For toxic text prefixes from an LLM safety benchmark, we conduct greedy search to identify optimal image prompts that maximally induce toxic completions. The discovered image prompts then drive RL-based diffusion model fine-tuning, producing semantically aligned adversarial images that boost toxicity rates. Stealth-aware optimization introduces joint adversarial rewards that balance toxicity maximization (via Detoxify classifier) and stealthiness (via BERTScore), circumventing traditional noise-based adversarial patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RTD, increasing the toxicity rate of LLaVA outputs by 10.69% over text-only baselines on the original attack set and 8.91% on an unseen set, proving generalization capability. Moreover, RTD exhibits strong cross-model transferability, raising the toxicity rate by 5.1% on Gemini and 26.83% on LLaMA. Our findings expose two critical flaws in current VLM alignment: (1) failure to prevent toxic continuation from harmful prefixes, and (2) overlooking cross-modal attack vectors. These results necessitate a paradigm shift toward multimodal red teaming in safety evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harmonizing Visual Representations for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21979v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying visual understanding and generation within a single multimodal framework remains a significant challenge, as the two inherently heterogeneous tasks require representations at different levels of granularity. Current approaches that utilize vector quantization (VQ) or variational autoencoders (VAE) for unified visual representation prioritize intrinsic imagery features over semantics, compromising understanding performance. In this work, we take inspiration from masked image modelling (MIM) that learns rich semantics via a mask-and-reconstruct pre-training and its successful extension to masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. A preliminary study on the MAR encoder's representation reveals exceptional linear probing accuracy and precise feature response to visual concepts, which indicates MAR's potential for visual understanding tasks beyond its original generation role. Based on these insights, we present \emph{Harmon}, a unified autoregressive framework that harmonizes understanding and generation tasks with a shared MAR encoder. Through a three-stage training procedure that progressively optimizes understanding and generation capabilities, Harmon achieves state-of-the-art image generation results on the GenEval, MJHQ30K and WISE benchmarks while matching the performance of methods with dedicated semantic encoders (e.g., Janus) on image understanding benchmarks.

| **[Gungnir: Exploiting Stylistic Features in Images for Backdoor Attacks on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20650v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR).

Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is crucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at uncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of their internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the discovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be leveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion only minor textural details are subject to change.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 32 figures, preliminary version</p></details> | None |

However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset. Our annotation tools and several examples of our dataset are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14876029 for easier review.

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

A key issue in this method is how to define steganographic distortion. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, the definition of distortion has evolved from manual design to deep learning design. Concurrently, rapid advancements in image generation have made generated images viable as cover media. However, existing distortion design methods based on machine learning do not fully leverage the advantages of generated cover media, resulting in suboptimal security performance. To address this issue, we propose GIFDL (Generated Image Fluctuation Distortion Learning), a steganographic distortion learning method based on the fluctuations in generated images. Inspired by the idea of natural steganography, we take a series of highly similar fluctuation images as the input to the steganographic distortion generator and introduce a new GAN training strategy to disguise stego images as fluctuation images. Experimental results demonstrate that GIFDL, compared with state-of-the-art GAN-based distortion learning methods, exhibits superior resistance to steganalysis, increasing the detection error rates by an average of 3.30% across three steganalyzers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TIFS</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements have positioned diffusion models as effective MDE tools by framing the challenge as a conditional image generation task. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle with accurately reconstructing distant depths, due largely to the imbalanced distribution of depth values and an over-reliance on spatial-domain features. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework that integrates adaptive frequency-domain feature enhancements with an adaptive weight-balancing mechanism into the diffusion process. Central to our approach is the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module, which dynamically refines spectral responses in the latent feature space, thereby improving the preservation of structural details and reducing noisy artifacts. Furthermore, we implement an adaptive weighting strategy that modulates the diffusion loss in real-time, enhancing the model's sensitivity towards distant depth reconstruction. These innovations collectively result in superior depth perception performance across both distance and detail. Experimental evaluations confirm that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion-based MDE techniques, particularly excelling in the accurate reconstruction of distant regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Generative AI models have made it possible to create high-quality images, but concerns about copyright infringement are a hindrance to their abundant use. As these models use data from training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to ensure they do not violate intellectual property rights. Some AI models have even been noted to directly copy copyrighted images, a problem often referred to as source copying. Traditional copyright protection measures such as watermarks and metadata have also proven to be futile in this regard. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step image generation model inspired by the conditional diffusion model. The first step involves creating an image segmentation mask for some prompt-based generated images. This mask embodies the shape of the image. Thereafter, the diffusion model is asked to generate the image anew while avoiding the shape in question. This approach shows a decrease in structural similarity from the training image, i.e. we are able to avoid the source copying problem using this approach without expensive retraining of the model or user-centered prompt generation techniques. This makes our approach the most computationally inexpensive approach to avoiding both copyright infringement and source copying for diffusion model-based image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, preprint</p></details> | None |

In this work, we present Twin-Co, a framework that leverages synchronized, co-adaptive dialogue to progressively refine image generation. Instead of a static generation process, Twin-Co employs a dynamic, iterative workflow where an intelligent dialogue agent continuously interacts with the user. Initially, a base image is generated from the user's prompt. Then, through a series of synchronized dialogue exchanges, the system adapts and optimizes the image according to evolving user feedback. The co-adaptive process allows the system to progressively narrow down ambiguities and better align with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that Twin-Co not only enhances user experience by reducing trial-and-error iterations but also improves the quality of the generated images, streamlining the creative process across various applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14815v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures | None |

This study introduces CRF-GAN, a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture that enhances structural consistency in 3D medical image synthesis. Integrating Conditional Random Fields within a two-step generation process allows CRF-GAN improving spatial coherence while maintaining high-resolution image quality. The model's performance is evaluated against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model. Materials and Methods: We evaluate the performance of CRF-GAN against the HA-GAN model. The comparison between the two models was made through a quantitative evaluation, using FID and MMD metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, to assess the realism of the generated images. Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID and MMD scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings. Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. The key objective was not only to lower the computational cost but also to reallocate the freed-up resources towards the creation of higher-resolution 3D imaging, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability. Moreover, unlike many previous studies, we combined qualitative and quantitative assessments to obtain a more holistic feedback on the model's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted to Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches rely on spatial visual tokens, where image patches are encoded and arranged according to a spatial order (e.g., raster scan). However, we show that spatial tokens lack the recursive structure inherent to languages, hence form an impossible language for LLM to master. In this paper, we build a proper visual language by leveraging diffusion timesteps to learn discrete, recursive visual tokens. Our proposed tokens recursively compensate for the progressive attribute loss in noisy images as timesteps increase, enabling the diffusion model to reconstruct the original image at any timestep. This approach allows us to effectively integrate the strengths of LLMs in autoregressive reasoning and diffusion models in precise image generation, achieving seamless multimodal comprehension and generation within a unified framework. Extensive experiments show that we achieve superior performance for multimodal comprehension and generation simultaneously compared with other MLLMs. Project Page: https://DDT-LLaMA.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://DDT-LLaMA.github.io/) |

It makes the hiding capacity of GS higher than that of traditional steganography, as well as more resistant to classical steganalysis. However, the generators and extractors of existing GS methods can only target specific formats and types of data and lack of universality. Besides, the model size is usually related to the underlying grid resolution, and the transmission behavior of the extractor is susceptible to suspicion of steganalysis. Implicit neural representation(INR) is a technique for representing data in a continuous manner. Inspired by this, we propose an INR-based generative steganography by point cloud representation (INR-GSPC). By using the function generator, the problem of the generator model size growing exponentially with the increase of gridded data has been solved. That is able to generate a wide range of data types and break through the limitation of resolution. In order to unify the data formats of the generator and message extractor, the data is converted to point cloud representation. We designed and fixed a point cloud message extractor. By iterating over the point cloud with adding small perturbations to generate stego-media. This method can avoid the training and transmission process of the message extractor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to apply point cloud to generative steganography. Experiments demonstrate that the stego-images generated by the scheme have an average PSNR value of more than 65, and the accuracy of message extraction reaches more than 99%.</p></details> | 10pages,13figures | None |

Nevertheless, we reveal the potential security risks posed by model editing techniques to image generation models. In this work, we establish the principles for backdoor attacks based on model editing, and propose a relationship-driven precise backdoor poisoning method, REDEditing. Drawing on the principles of equivalent-attribute alignment and stealthy poisoning, we develop an equivalent relationship retrieval and joint-attribute transfer approach that ensures consistent backdoor image generation through concept rebinding. A knowledge isolation constraint is proposed to preserve benign generation integrity. Our method achieves an 11\% higher attack success rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Remarkably, adding just one line of code enhances output naturalness while improving backdoor stealthiness by 24\%. This work aims to heighten awareness regarding this security vulnerability in editable image generation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |

Recently, many methods based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework have been proposed to address sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Although these methods have made considerable advancements, they still show significant issues with overfitting. To reduce the overfitting, we introduce VGNC, a novel Validation-guided Gaussian Number Control (VGNC) approach based on generative novel view synthesis (NVS) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the overfitting issue of sparse-view 3DGS with generative validation images. Specifically, we first introduce a validation image generation method based on a generative NVS model. We then propose a Gaussian number control strategy that utilizes generated validation images to determine the optimal Gaussian numbers, thereby reducing the issue of overfitting. We conducted detailed experiments on various sparse-view 3DGS baselines and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of VGNC. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only reduces overfitting but also improves rendering quality on the test set while decreasing the number of Gaussian points. This reduction lowers storage demands and accelerates both training and rendering. The code will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages,8 figures | None |

However, due to the complex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced class distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical images from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods, which typically fine-tune models using embedded identifiers, often struggle with insufficient stylization and inaccurate image content due to reduced textual controllability. In this paper, we propose style refinement and content preservation strategies. The style refinement strategy leverages the semantic information of visual reasoning prompts and reference images to optimize style embeddings, allowing a more precise and consistent representation of style information. The content preservation strategy addresses the content bias problem by preserving the model's generalization capabilities, ensuring enhanced textual controllability without compromising stylization. Experimental results verify that our approach achieves superior performance in generating consistent and personalized text-to-image outputs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Image Synthesis via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00050v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in various image generation tasks compared with Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs). Recent work on semantic image synthesis mainly follows the de facto GAN-based approaches, which may lead to unsatisfactory quality or diversity of generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on DDPM for semantic image synthesis. Unlike previous conditional diffusion model directly feeds the semantic layout and noisy image as input to a U-Net structure, which may not fully leverage the information in the input semantic mask, our framework processes semantic layout and noisy image differently. It feeds noisy image to the encoder of the U-Net structure while the semantic layout to the decoder by multi-layer spatially-adaptive normalization operators. To further improve the generation quality and semantic interpretability in semantic image synthesis, we introduce the classifier-free guidance sampling strategy, which acknowledge the scores of an unconditional model for sampling process. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity (FID) and diversity (LPIPS).

However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures | None |

Existing studies either fail to guarantee complete safety under potentially harmful concepts or struggle to balance safety with generation quality. To address these issues, we propose Safety-Constrained Direct Preference Optimization (SC-DPO), a novel framework for safety alignment in T2I models. SC-DPO integrates safety constraints into the general human preference calibration, aiming to maximize the likelihood of generating human-preferred samples while minimizing the safety cost of the generated outputs. In SC-DPO, we introduce a safety cost model to accurately quantify harmful levels for images, and train it effectively using the proposed contrastive learning and cost anchoring objectives. To apply SC-DPO for effective T2I safety alignment, we constructed SCP-10K, a safety-constrained preference dataset containing rich harmful concepts, which blends safety-constrained preference pairs under both harmful and clean instructions, further mitigating the trade-off between safety and sample quality. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Focusing Mechanism (DFM) for SC-DPO, promoting the model's learning of difficult preference pair samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-DPO outperforms existing methods, effectively defending against various NSFW content while maintaining optimal sample quality and human preference alignment. Additionally, SC-DPO exhibits resilience against adversarial prompts designed to generate harmful content.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that generalizes over existing isotropic models by considering a hybrid noise scheme. In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also particularly more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results (FID and CLIP score) showing consistent improvements of up to 30% for both tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14267v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging RWKV-7's linear-complexity Weighted Key-Value (WKV) architecture, CrossWKV integrates text and image modalities in a single pass, utilizing a generalized delta rule with vector-valued gating and low-rank adaptations (LoRA) to achieve superior cross-modal alignment. Unlike Transformer-based models, CrossWKV's non-diagonal, input-dependent transition matrix enables it to represent complex functions beyond the $\mathrm{TC}^0$ complexity class, including all regular languages, as demonstrated by its ability to perform state-tracking tasks like $S_5$ permutation modeling. Evaluated within the Diffusion in RWKV-7 (DIR-7) on datasets such as LAION-5B and ImageNet, CrossWKV achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.88 and a CLIP score of 0.33 on ImageNet 256x256, matching state-of-the-art performance while offering robust generalization across diverse prompts. The model's enhanced expressivity, combined with constant memory usage and linear scaling, positions it as a powerful solution for advanced cross-modal tasks, with potential applications in high-resolution generation and dynamic state manipulation.Code at https://github.com/TorchRWKV/flash-linear-attention</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TorchRWKV/flash-linear-attention) |

We argue that fake image detection should not operate as a "black box". Instead, an ideal approach must ensure both strong generalization and transparency. Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers new opportunities for reasoning-based AI-generated image detection. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to traditional detection methods and human evaluators, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.</p></details> |  | None |

By framing the task as grid-based image completion and simply replicating the subject image(s) in a mosaic layout, we activate strong identity-preserving capabilities without any additional data, training, or inference-time fine-tuning. This "free lunch" approach is further strengthened by a novel cascade attention design and meta prompting technique, boosting fidelity and versatility. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines across multiple key metrics in benchmarks and human preference studies, with trade-offs in certain aspects. Additionally, it supports diverse edits, including logo insertion, virtual try-on, and subject replacement or insertion. These results demonstrate that a pre-trained foundational text-to-image model can enable high-quality, resource-efficient subject-driven generation, opening new possibilities for lightweight customization in downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

While much of the discourse has focused on biases and stereotypes embedded in large-scale training datasets, the sociotechnical dynamics of user interactions with these models remain underexplored. This study examines the linguistic and semantic choices users make when crafting prompts and how these choices influence the diversity of generated outputs. Analyzing over six million prompts from the Civiverse dataset on the CivitAI platform across seven months, we categorize users into three groups based on their levels of linguistic experimentation: consistent repeaters, occasional repeaters, and non-repeaters. Our findings reveal that as user participation grows over time, prompt language becomes increasingly homogenized through the adoption of popular community tags and descriptors, with repeated prompts comprising 40-50% of submissions. At the same time, semantic similarity and topic preferences remain relatively stable, emphasizing common subjects and surface aesthetics. Using Vendi scores to quantify visual diversity, we demonstrate a clear correlation between lexical similarity in prompts and the visual similarity of generated images, showing that linguistic repetition reinforces less diverse representations. These findings highlight the significant role of user-driven factors in shaping AI-generated imagery, beyond inherent model biases, and underscore the need for tools and practices that encourage greater linguistic and thematic experimentation within TTI systems to foster more inclusive and diverse AI-generated content.</p></details> |  | None |

Established on the off-the-shelf text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, we propose a novel training-free text-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation framework dubbed as \textbf{P}hase-\textbf{T}ransferred \textbf{Diffusion} Model (PTDiffusion) for hidden art syntheses. PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image into arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images exhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image. At the heart of our method is a plug-and-play phase transfer mechanism that dynamically and progressively transplants diffusion features' phase spectrum from the denoising process to reconstruct the reference image into the one to sample the generated illusion image, realizing deep fusion of the reference structural information and the textual semantic information in the diffusion model latent space. Furthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control to the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model training and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related text-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual discernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.

In particular, classifier-free guidance (CFG) -- the most widely adopted guidance technique -- contrasts conditional and unconditional predictions to improve the generated images. This results, however, in trade-offs across quality, diversity and consistency, improving some at the expense of others. While recent work has shown that it is possible to disentangle these factors to some extent, such methods come with an overhead of requiring an additional (weaker) model, or require more forward passes per sampling step. In this paper, we propose Entropy Rectifying Guidance (ERG), a simple and effective guidance mechanism based on inference-time changes in the attention mechanism of state-of-the-art diffusion transformer architectures, which allows for simultaneous improvements over image quality, diversity and prompt consistency. ERG is more general than CFG and similar guidance techniques, as it extends to unconditional sampling. ERG results in significant improvements in various generation tasks such as text-to-image, class-conditional and unconditional image generation. We also show that ERG can be seamlessly combined with other recent guidance methods such as CADS and APG, further boosting generation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias. Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, effective interaction with these models is challenging for average users due to the need for specialized prompt engineering knowledge and the inability to perform multi-turn image generation, hindering a dynamic and iterative creation process. Recent attempts have tried to equip Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with T2I models to bring the user's natural language instructions into reality. Hence, the output modality of MLLMs is extended, and the multi-turn generation quality of T2I models is enhanced thanks to the strong multi-modal comprehension ability of MLLMs. However, many of these works face challenges in identifying correct output modalities and generating coherent images accordingly as the number of output modalities increases and the conversations go deeper. Therefore, we propose DialogGen, an effective pipeline to align off-the-shelf MLLMs and T2I models to build a Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System (MIDS) for multi-turn Text-to-Image generation. It is composed of drawing prompt alignment, careful training data curation, and error correction. Moreover, as the field of MIDS flourishes, comprehensive benchmarks are urgently needed to evaluate MIDS fairly in terms of output modality correctness and multi-modal output coherence. To address this issue, we introduce the Multi-modal Dialogue Benchmark (DialogBen), a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to assess the ability of MLLMs to generate accurate and coherent multi-modal content that supports image editing. It contains two evaluation metrics to measure the model's ability to switch modalities and the coherence of the output images.

Prior approaches have difficulties in recovering fine-grained details and true colors of the scene under extremely low-light environments due to near-to-zero SNR. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown significant progress towards general domain image generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the pre-trained latent diffusion model to perform the neural ISP for enhancing extremely low-light images. Specifically, to tailor the pre-trained latent diffusion model to operate on the RAW domain, we train a set of lightweight taming modules to inject the RAW information into the diffusion denoising process via modulating the intermediate features of UNet. We further observe different roles of UNet denoising and decoder reconstruction in the latent diffusion model, which inspires us to decompose the low-light image enhancement task into latent-space low-frequency content generation and decoding-phase high-frequency detail maintenance. Through extensive experiments on representative datasets, we demonstrate our simple design not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons over strong baselines, which highlight the effectiveness of powerful generative priors for neural ISP under extremely low-light environments.

To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities. Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7 points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively.

| **[Early Timestep Zero-Shot Candidate Selection for Instruction-Guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13490v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are designed for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit creative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be difficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in diverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and personalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool that (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image generative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space of generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize expansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains demonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity and help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks, thereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of possible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual creativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future text-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic values and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely available with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts scalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using deep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen regions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural inconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we present SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose Texture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and leverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired high-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point for texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first employ a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment between image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second, we use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the observed colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing accurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting module to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines these results into a unified full texture map. Extensive experiments shows that our SMPL-GPTexture can generate high resolution texture aligned with user's prompts.</p></details> |  | None |

As the quality of base-model generated images continues to improve, so does the demand for further application like image editing. In recent years, many remarkable works are realizing a wide variety of editing effects. However, the wide variety of editing types and diverse editing approaches have made it difficult for researchers to establish a comprehensive view of the development of this field. In this survey, we summarize the image editing field from four aspects: tasks definition, methods classification, results evaluation and editing datasets. First, we provide a definition of image editing, which in turn leads to a variety of editing task forms from the perspective of operation parts and manipulation actions. Subsequently, we categorize and summary methods for implementing editing into three categories: inversion-based, fine-tuning-based and adapter-based. In addition, we organize the currently used metrics, available datasets and corresponding construction methods. At the end, we present some visions for the future development of the image editing field based on the previous summaries.</p></details> |  | None |

While diffusion models have dominated this domain, auto-regressive models, with their unified architecture for text and image modeling, remain underexplored for personalized image generation. This paper investigates the potential of optimizing auto-regressive models for personalized image synthesis, leveraging their inherent multimodal capabilities to perform this task. We propose a two-stage training strategy that combines optimization of text embeddings and fine-tuning of transformer layers. Our experiments on the auto-regressive model demonstrate that this method achieves comparable subject fidelity and prompt following to the leading diffusion-based personalization methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of auto-regressive models in personalized image generation, offering a new direction for future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/KaiyueSun98/T2I-Personalization-with-AR</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/KaiyueSun98/T2I-Personalization-with-AR) |

In this paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key insight is treating scenes as hierarchical "objects" under isometric views, where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://zju3dv.github.io/hiscene/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zju3dv.github.io/hiscene) |

As such, amateur users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles (perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable. To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely, ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then, ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions. The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario.

However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image.

Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning.

However, conventional VAEs often generate relatively blurry images due to their assumption of an isotropic Gaussian latent space and constraints in capturing high-frequency details. In this paper, we explore a novel wavelet-based approach (Wavelet-VAE) in which the latent space is constructed using multi-scale Haar wavelet coefficients. We propose a comprehensive method to encode the image features into multi-scale detail and approximation coefficients and introduce a learnable noise parameter to maintain stochasticity. We thoroughly discuss how to reformulate the reparameterization trick, address the KL divergence term, and integrate wavelet sparsity principles into the training objective. Our experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and other high-resolution datasets demonstrates that the Wavelet-VAE improves visual fidelity and recovers higher-resolution details compared to conventional VAEs. We conclude with a discussion of advantages, potential limitations, and future research directions for wavelet-based generative modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Our experiments reveal that initialization seeds are highly detectable, along with other subtle variations in the image generation process to some extent. We further investigate what visual traces are leveraged in image attribution by perturbing high-frequency details and employing mid-level representations of image style and structure. Notably, altering high-frequency information causes only slight reductions in accuracy, and training an attributor on style representations outperforms training on RGB images.

By varying the random seeds, we can generate many images for a fixed text prompt. Technically, the seed controls the initial noise and, in multi-step diffusion inference, the noise used for reparameterization at intermediate timesteps in the reverse diffusion process. However, the specific impact of the random seed on the generated images remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale scientific study into the impact of random seeds during diffusion inference. Remarkably, we reveal that the best 'golden' seed achieved an impressive FID of 21.60, compared to the worst 'inferior' seed's FID of 31.97. Additionally, a classifier can predict the seed number used to generate an image with over 99.9% accuracy in just a few epochs, establishing that seeds are highly distinguishable based on generated images. Encouraged by these findings, we examined the influence of seeds on interpretable visual dimensions. We find that certain seeds consistently produce grayscale images, prominent sky regions, or image borders. Seeds also affect image composition, including object location, size, and depth. Moreover, by leveraging these 'golden' seeds, we demonstrate improved image generation such as high-fidelity inference and diversified sampling. Our investigation extends to inpainting tasks, where we uncover some seeds that tend to insert unwanted text artifacts. Overall, our extensive analyses highlight the importance of selecting good seeds and offer practical utility for image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require subject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual controllability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a scalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation diffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental advantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse character appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity results. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked transformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character features and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion transformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a large-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset is systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired (text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables simultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability through distinct learning pathways.

This overwhelming specialized model production introduces new challenges for high parameter redundancy and huge storage cost, thereby necessitating the development of effective methods to consolidate and unify the capabilities of diverse powerful models into a single one. A common practice in model merging adopts static linear interpolation in the parameter space to achieve the goal of style mixing. However, it neglects the features of T2I generation task that numerous distinct models cover sundry styles which may lead to incompatibility and confusion in the merged model. To address this issue, we introduce a style-promptable image generation pipeline which can accurately generate arbitrary-style images under the control of style vectors. Based on this design, we propose the score distillation based model merging paradigm (DMM), compressing multiple models into a single versatile T2I model. Moreover, we rethink and reformulate the model merging task in the context of T2I generation, by presenting new merging goals and evaluation protocols. Our experiments demonstrate that DMM can compactly reorganize the knowledge from multiple teacher models and achieve controllable arbitrary-style generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional demoir\'eing methods have generally treated images as a whole for processing and training, neglecting the unique signal characteristics of different color channels. Moreover, the randomness and variability of moir\'e pattern generation pose challenges to the robustness of existing methods when applied to real-world data. To address these issues, this paper presents SIDME (Self-supervised Image Demoir\'eing via Masked Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction), a novel model designed to generate high-quality visual images by effectively processing moir\'e patterns. SIDME combines a masked encoder-decoder architecture with self-supervised learning, allowing the model to reconstruct images using the inherent properties of camera sampling frequencies. A key innovation is the random masked image reconstructor, which utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to handle the reconstruction task. Furthermore, since the green channel in camera sampling has a higher sampling frequency compared to red and blue channels, a specialized self-supervised loss function is designed to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure the generalization ability of the model, a self-supervised moir\'e image generation method has been developed to produce a dataset that closely mimics real-world conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDME outperforms existing methods in processing real moir\'e pattern data, showing its superior generalization performance and robustness.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures | None |

Current methods, including those based on Visual Question Answering (VQA), still struggle with fine-grained assessments and precise quantification of image-text alignment. This paper presents an improved evaluation method named Instruction-augmented Multimodal Alignment for Image-Text and Element Matching (iMatch), which evaluates image-text semantic alignment by fine-tuning multimodal large language models. We introduce four innovative augmentation strategies: First, the QAlign strategy creates a precise probabilistic mapping to convert discrete scores from multimodal large language models into continuous matching scores. Second, a validation set augmentation strategy uses pseudo-labels from model predictions to expand training data, boosting the model's generalization performance. Third, an element augmentation strategy integrates element category labels to refine the model's understanding of image-text matching. Fourth, an image augmentation strategy employs techniques like random lighting to increase the model's robustness. Additionally, we propose prompt type augmentation and score perturbation strategies to further enhance the accuracy of element assessments. Our experimental results show that the iMatch method significantly surpasses existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and practical value.

Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures.

To address this issue, this paper proposes Direction-Aware Diagonal Autoregressive Image Generation (DAR) method, which generates image tokens following a diagonal scanning order. The proposed diagonal scanning order ensures that tokens with adjacent indices remain in close proximity while enabling causal attention to gather information from a broader range of directions. Additionally, two direction-aware modules: 4D-RoPE and direction embeddings are introduced, enhancing the model's capability to handle frequent changes in generation direction. To leverage the representational capacity of the image tokenizer, we use its codebook as the image token embeddings. We propose models of varying scales, ranging from 485M to 2.0B. On the 256$\times$256 ImageNet benchmark, our DAR-XL (2.0B) outperforms all previous autoregressive image generators, achieving a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Safe Synthetic Image Generation On the Web: A Multimodal Robust NSFW Defense and Million Scale Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11707v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past years, we have witnessed the remarkable success of Text-to-Image (T2I) models and their widespread use on the web. Extensive research in making T2I models produce hyper-realistic images has led to new concerns, such as generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) web content and polluting the web society. To help prevent misuse of T2I models and create a safer web environment for users features like NSFW filters and post-hoc security checks are used in these models. However, recent work unveiled how these methods can easily fail to prevent misuse. In particular, adversarial attacks on text and image modalities can easily outplay defensive measures. %Exploiting such leads to the growing concern of preventing adversarial attacks on text and image modalities. Moreover, there is currently no robust multimodal NSFW dataset that includes both prompt and image pairs and adversarial examples. This work proposes a million-scale prompt and image dataset generated using open-source diffusion models. Second, we develop a multimodal defense to distinguish safe and NSFW text and images, which is robust against adversarial attacks and directly alleviates current challenges. Our extensive experiments show that our model performs well against existing SOTA NSFW detection methods in terms of accuracy and recall, drastically reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in multimodal adversarial attack scenarios.

In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TDRI: Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation for Interactive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17669v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although text-to-image generation technologies have made significant advancements, they still face challenges when dealing with ambiguous prompts and aligning outputs with user intent.Our proposed framework, TDRI (Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation), addresses these issues by enhancing image generation through iterative user interaction. It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring reconstruction quality for the ground user, we propose a novel metric to measure delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> | None |

However, directly repurposing the generative denoising process for discriminative objectives reveals critical gaps rarely addressed previously. Generative models tolerate intermediate sampling errors if the final distribution remains plausible, but discriminative tasks require rigorous accuracy throughout, as evidenced in challenging multi-modal tasks like referring image segmentation. Motivated by this gap, we analyze and enhance alignment between generative diffusion processes and perception tasks, focusing on how perception quality evolves during denoising. We find: (1) earlier denoising steps contribute disproportionately to perception quality, prompting us to propose tailored learning objectives reflecting varying timestep contributions; (2) later denoising steps show unexpected perception degradation, highlighting sensitivity to training-denoising distribution shifts, addressed by our diffusion-tailored data augmentation; and (3) generative processes uniquely enable interactivity, serving as controllable user interfaces adaptable to correctional prompts in multi-round interactions. Our insights significantly improve diffusion-based perception models without architectural changes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on depth estimation, referring image segmentation, and generalist perception tasks.

Recent advancements in GANs include 3D-aware models such as EG3D, which feature efficient triplane-based architectures capable of reconstructing 3D geometry from single images. However, limited attention has been given to providing an integrated framework for 3D-aware, high-quality, reference-based image editing. This study addresses this gap by exploring and demonstrating the effectiveness of the triplane space for advanced reference-based edits. Our novel approach integrates encoding, automatic localization, spatial disentanglement of triplane features, and fusion learning to achieve the desired edits. We demonstrate how our approach excels across diverse domains, including human faces, 360-degree heads, animal faces, partially stylized edits like cartoon faces, full-body clothing edits, and edits on class-agnostic samples. Our method shows state-of-the-art performance over relevant latent direction, text, and image-guided 2D and 3D-aware diffusion and GAN methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Highlight.

| **[ADT: Tuning Diffusion Models with Adversarial Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11423v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved outstanding image generation by reversing a forward noising process to approximate true data distributions. During training, these models predict diffusion scores from noised versions of true samples in a single forward pass, while inference requires iterative denoising starting from white noise. This training-inference divergences hinder the alignment between inference and training data distributions, due to potential prediction biases and cumulative error accumulation. To address this problem, we propose an intuitive but effective fine-tuning framework, called Adversarial Diffusion Tuning (ADT), by stimulating the inference process during optimization and aligning the final outputs with training data by adversarial supervision. Specifically, to achieve robust adversarial training, ADT features a siamese-network discriminator with a fixed pre-trained backbone and lightweight trainable parameters, incorporates an image-to-image sampling strategy to smooth discriminative difficulties, and preserves the original diffusion loss to prevent discriminator hacking. In addition, we carefully constrain the backward-flowing path for back-propagating gradients along the inference path without incurring memory overload or gradient explosion. Finally, extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion models (v1.5, XL, and v3), demonstrate that ADT significantly improves both distribution alignment and image quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, capturing such images is expensive and requires specialized equipment, making ODI synthesis increasingly important. While common 2D image generation and editing methods are rapidly advancing, these models struggle to deliver satisfactory results when generating or editing ODIs due to the unique format and broad 360$^{\circ}$ Field-of-View (FoV) of ODIs. To bridge this gap, we construct \textbf{\textit{Any2Omni}}, the first comprehensive ODI generation-editing dataset comprises 60,000+ training data covering diverse input conditions and up to 9 ODI generation and editing tasks. Built upon Any2Omni, we propose an \textbf{\underline{Omni}} model for \textbf{\underline{Omni}}-directional image generation and editing (\textbf{\textit{Omni$^2$}}), with the capability of handling various ODI generation and editing tasks under diverse input conditions using one model.

We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation.

However, these models also face the risk of unsafe generation, potentially producing harmful content that violates usage policies, such as explicit material. Existing safe generation methods typically focus on suppressing inappropriate content by erasing undesired concepts from visual representations, while neglecting to sanitize the textual representation. Although these methods help mitigate the risk of misuse to some extent, their robustness remains insufficient when dealing with adversarial attacks. Given that semantic consistency between input text and output image is a core requirement of T2I models, we identify that textual representations are likely the primary source of unsafe generation. To this end, we propose Embedding Sanitizer (ES), which enhances the safety of T2I models by sanitizing inappropriate concepts in prompt embeddings. To our knowledge, ES is the first interpretable safe generation framework that assigns a score to each token in the prompt to indicate its potential harmfulness. In addition, ES adopts a plug-and-play modular design, offering compatibility for seamless integration with various T2I models and other safeguards. Evaluations on five prompt benchmarks show that ES outperforms eleven existing safeguard baselines, achieving state-of-the-art robustness while maintaining high-quality image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

We define bias as a model's unfair deviation from population statistics given neutral prompts. Our experiments with Stable Diffusion XL, 3.5 and Flux demonstrate that LLM-modified prompts significantly increase image diversity and reduce bias without the need to change the image generators themselves. While occasionally producing results that diverge from original user intent for elaborate prompts, this approach generally provides more varied interpretations of underspecified requests rather than superficial variations. The method works particularly well for less advanced image generators, though limitations persist for certain contexts like disability representation.

While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

However, most models require significant computational resources to achieve this. This becomes apparent in the application of medical image synthesis due to the 3D nature of medical datasets like CT-scans, MRIs, electron microscope, etc. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for a single GPU memory-efficient training for diffusion models for high dimensional medical datasets. The proposed model is built by using an invertible UNet architecture with invertible attention modules. This leads to the following two contributions: 1. denoising diffusion models and thus enabling memory usage to be independent of the dimensionality of the dataset, and 2. reducing the energy usage during training. While this new model can be applied to a multitude of image generation tasks, we showcase its memory-efficiency on the 3D BraTS2020 dataset leading to up to 15\% decrease in peak memory consumption during training with comparable results to SOTA while maintaining the image quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most of them struggle to synthesize plausible 3D assets when the reference image is flat-colored like hand drawings due to the lack of 3D illusion, which are often the most user-friendly input modalities in art content creation. To this end, we propose Art3D, a training-free method that can lift flat-colored 2D designs into 3D. By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D image generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully enhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying the process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of painting styles. To benchmark the generalization performance of existing image-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new dataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples. Experimental results demonstrate the performance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity and promising practical applicability.

Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models.

Existing methods face certain limitations in terms of both data and algorithm. For training data, most approaches rely on manual annotated preference data, either by directly fine-tuning the generators or by training reward models to provide training signals. However, the high annotation cost makes them difficult to scale up, the reward model consumes extra computation and cannot guarantee accuracy. From an algorithmic perspective, most methods neglect the value of text and only take the image feedback as a comparative signal, which is inefficient and sparse. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the InstructEngine framework. Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a taxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data construction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models and human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally, we introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency by organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs. Evaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and SDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all components. A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that InstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce RHanDS, a conditional diffusion-based framework designed to refine malformed hands by utilizing decoupled structure and style guidance. The hand mesh reconstructed from the malformed hand offers structure guidance for correcting the structure of the hand, while the malformed hand itself provides style guidance for preserving the style of the hand. To alleviate the mutual interference between style and structure guidance, we introduce a two-stage training strategy and build a series of multi-style hand datasets. In the first stage, we use paired hand images for training to ensure stylistic consistency in hand refining. In the second stage, various hand images generated based on human meshes are used for training, enabling the model to gain control over the hand structure. Experimental results demonstrate that RHanDS can effectively refine hand structure while preserving consistency in hand style.</p></details> |  | None |

They are poorly understood and suffer from strong biases inherited from the training sets. One way to address these shortcomings is to have a better control over the training sets, in particular by using synthetic sets. In this paper, we propose a synthetic image generator relying on a few simple principles. In particular, we focus on geometric modeling, textures, and a simple modeling of image acquisition. These properties, integrated in a classical Dead Leaves model, enable the creation of efficient training sets. Standard image denoising and super-resolution networks can be trained on such datasets, reaching performance almost on par with training on natural image datasets. As a first step towards explainability, we provide a careful analysis of the considered principles, identifying which image properties are necessary to obtain good performances. Besides, such training also yields better robustness to various geometric and radiometric perturbations of the test sets.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper contributes a ChatGPT-Prompted visual hallucination evaluation Dataset (PhD) for objective VHE at a large scale. The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM questions about specific images to assess its susceptibility to hallucination. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e. task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term PhD-base, PhD also asks questions with specious context (PhD-sec) or with incorrect context ({PhD-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (PhD-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory item (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, specious / incorrect context generation, and counter-common-sense (CCS) image generation. With over 14k daily images, 750 CCS images and 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes and tasks, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025, Highlight</p></details> | None |

However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation.

We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that a) transformers have an increased need for data and b) labelled image generation procedures for microelectronics are costly, and labelled data is therefore sparse. Whereas in other domains, pre-training on large natural image datasets can mitigate this problem, in microelectronics transfer learning is hindered due to the dissimilarity of domain data and natural images. Therefore, we evaluate self pre-training, where models are pre-trained on the target dataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a vision transformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in microelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). In MAE, a large share of image patches is masked and reconstructed by the model during pre-training. We perform pre-training and defect detection using a dataset of less than 10.000 scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) images labelled using transient thermal analysis (TTA). Our experimental results show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains compared to a) supervised ViT, b) ViT pre-trained on natural image datasets, and c) state-of-the-art CNN-based defect detection models used in the literature. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals that our self pre-trained models, in comparison to ViT baselines, correctly focus on defect-relevant features such as cracks in the solder material. This demonstrates that our approach yields fault-specific feature representations, making our self pre-trained models viable for real-world defect detection in microelectronics.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |

Very few existing attempts at data valuation methods designed for deep generative models either concentrate on specific models or lack robustness in their outcomes. Moreover, efficiency still reveals vulnerable shortcomings. We formulate the data valuation problem in generative models from a similarity matching perspective to bridge the gaps. Specifically, we introduce Generative Model Valuator (GMValuator), the first training-free and model-agnostic approach to providing data valuation for image generation tasks. It empowers efficient data valuation through our innovative similarity matching module, calibrates biased contributions by incorporating image quality assessment, and attributes credits to all training samples based on their contributions to the generated samples. Additionally, we introduce four evaluation criteria for assessing data valuation methods in generative models. GMValuator is extensively evaluated on benchmark and high-resolution datasets and various mainstream generative architectures to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Early-Bird Diffusion: Investigating and Leveraging Timestep-Aware Early-Bird Tickets in Diffusion Models for Efficient Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09606v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training diffusion models (DMs) requires substantial computational resources due to multiple forward and backward passes across numerous timesteps, motivating research into efficient training techniques. In this paper, we propose EB-Diff-Train, a new efficient DM training approach that is orthogonal to other methods of accelerating DM training, by investigating and leveraging Early-Bird (EB) tickets -- sparse subnetworks that manifest early in the training process and maintain high generation quality. We first investigate the existence of traditional EB tickets in DMs, enabling competitive generation quality without fully training a dense model. Then, we delve into the concept of diffusion-dedicated EB tickets, drawing on insights from varying importance of different timestep regions. These tickets adapt their sparsity levels according to the importance of corresponding timestep regions, allowing for aggressive sparsity during non-critical regions while conserving computational resources for crucial timestep regions. Building on this, we develop an efficient DM training technique that derives timestep-aware EB tickets, trains them in parallel, and combines them during inference for image generation. Extensive experiments validate the existence of both traditional and timestep-aware EB tickets, as well as the effectiveness of our proposed EB-Diff-Train method. This approach can significantly reduce training time both spatially and temporally -- achieving 2.9$\times$ to 5.8$\times$ speedups over training unpruned dense models, and up to 10.3$\times$ faster training compared to standard train-prune-finetune pipelines -- without compromising generative quality.

However, restoration of ancient murals, as an important downstream task in this field, poses significant challenges to diffusion model-based restoration methods due to its large defective area and scarce training samples. Conditional restoration tasks are more concerned with whether the restored part meets the aesthetic standards of mural restoration in terms of overall style and seam detail, and such metrics for evaluating heuristic image complements are lacking in current research. We therefore propose DiffuMural, a combined Multi-scale convergence and Collaborative Diffusion mechanism with ControlNet and cyclic consistency loss to optimise the matching between the generated images and the conditional control. DiffuMural demonstrates outstanding capabilities in mural restoration, leveraging training data from 23 large-scale Dunhuang murals that exhibit consistent visual aesthetics. The model excels in restoring intricate details, achieving a coherent overall appearance, and addressing the unique challenges posed by incomplete murals lacking factual grounding. Our evaluation framework incorporates four key metrics to quantitatively assess incomplete murals: factual accuracy, textural detail, contextual semantics, and holistic visual coherence. Furthermore, we integrate humanistic value assessments to ensure the restored murals retain their cultural and artistic significance. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing image protection methods, though effective, struggle to balance protection efficacy, invisibility, and latency, thus limiting practical use. We introduce perturbation pre-training to reduce latency and propose a mixture-of-perturbations approach that dynamically adapts to input images to minimize performance degradation. Our novel training strategy computes protection loss across multiple VAE feature spaces, while adaptive targeted protection at inference enhances robustness and invisibility. Experiments show comparable protection performance with improved invisibility and drastically reduced inference time.

| **[D$^2$iT: Dynamic Diffusion Transformer for Accurate Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09454v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are widely recognized for their ability to generate high-fidelity images. Despite the excellent performance and scalability of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, it applies fixed compression across different image regions during the diffusion process, disregarding the naturally varying information densities present in these regions. However, large compression leads to limited local realism, while small compression increases computational complexity and compromises global consistency, ultimately impacting the quality of generated images. To address these limitations, we propose dynamically compressing different image regions by recognizing the importance of different regions, and introduce a novel two-stage framework designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of image generation: (1) Dynamic VAE (DVAE) at first stage employs a hierarchical encoder to encode different image regions at different downsampling rates, tailored to their specific information densities, thereby providing more accurate and natural latent codes for the diffusion process. (2) Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (D$^2$iT) at second stage generates images by predicting multi-grained noise, consisting of coarse-grained (less latent code in smooth regions) and fine-grained (more latent codes in detailed regions), through an novel combination of the Dynamic Grain Transformer and the Dynamic Content Transformer. The strategy of combining rough prediction of noise with detailed regions correction achieves a unification of global consistency and local realism. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be released at https://github.com/jiawn-creator/Dynamic-DiT.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jiawn-creator/Dynamic-DiT) |
| **[On the Wasserstein Convergence and Straightness of Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14949v6)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and denoising. Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) proposed Rectified Flow (RF), a generative model that aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a novel formulation of straightness stronger than that in the original work. Secondly, we present general conditions guaranteeing uniqueness and straightness of 1-RF, which is in line with previous empirical findings. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that, in one dimension, RF started at the standard Gaussian distribution yields the Monge map. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

By framing the task as grid-based image completion and simply replicating the subject image(s) in a mosaic layout, we activate strong identity-preserving capabilities without any additional data, training, or inference-time fine-tuning. This "free lunch" approach is further strengthened by a novel cascade attention design and meta prompting technique, boosting fidelity and versatility. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines across multiple key metrics in benchmarks and human preference studies, with trade-offs in certain aspects. Additionally, it supports diverse edits, including logo insertion, virtual try-on, and subject replacement or insertion. These results demonstrate that a pre-trained foundational text-to-image model can enable high-quality, resource-efficient subject-driven generation, opening new possibilities for lightweight customization in downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MedIL: Implicit Latent Spaces for Generating Heterogeneous Medical Images at Arbitrary Resolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09322v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce MedIL, a first-of-its-kind autoencoder built for encoding medical images with heterogeneous sizes and resolutions for image generation. Medical images are often large and heterogeneous, where fine details are of vital clinical importance. Image properties change drastically when considering acquisition equipment, patient demographics, and pathology, making realistic medical image generation challenging. Recent work in latent diffusion models (LDMs) has shown success in generating images resampled to a fixed-size. However, this is a narrow subset of the resolutions native to image acquisition, and resampling discards fine anatomical details. MedIL utilizes implicit neural representations to treat images as continuous signals, where encoding and decoding can be performed at arbitrary resolutions without prior resampling. We quantitatively and qualitatively show how MedIL compresses and preserves clinically-relevant features over large multi-site, multi-resolution datasets of both T1w brain MRIs and lung CTs. We further demonstrate how MedIL can influence the quality of images generated with a diffusion model, and discuss how MedIL can enhance generative models to resemble raw clinical acquisitions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Explainable Partial-AIGC Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09291v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI-driven visual generation technologies has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in image manipulation, particularly in achieving photorealistic localized editing effects on natural scene images (NSIs). Despite extensive research on image quality assessment (IQA) for AI-generated images (AGIs), most studies focus on fully AI-generated outputs (e.g., text-to-image generation), leaving the quality assessment of partial-AIGC images (PAIs)-images with localized AI-driven edits an almost unprecedented field. Motivated by this gap, we construct the first large-scale PAI dataset towards explainable partial-AIGC image quality assessment (EPAIQA), the EPAIQA-15K, which includes 15K images with localized AI manipulation in different regions and over 300K multi-dimensional human ratings. Based on this, we leverage large multi-modal models (LMMs) and propose a three-stage model training paradigm. This paradigm progressively trains the LMM for editing region grounding, quantitative quality scoring, and quality explanation. Finally, we develop the EPAIQA series models, which possess explainable quality feedback capabilities. Our work represents a pioneering effort in the perceptual IQA field for comprehensive PAI quality assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

Model Watermarking is an effective method to prevent the unauthorized use of subject-driven or style-driven image generation, safeguarding concept copyrights. However, under the goal of concept-oriented protection, current watermarking schemes typically add watermarks to all images rather than applying them in a refined manner targeted at specific concepts. Additionally, the personalization techniques of diffusion models can easily remove watermarks. Existing watermarking methods struggle to achieve fine-grained watermark embedding with a few images of specific concept and prevent removal of watermarks through personalized fine-tuning. Therefore, we introduce a novel concept-oriented watermarking framework that seamlessly embeds imperceptible watermarks into the concept of diffusion models. We introduce Fidelity-preserving Latent Watermarking (FLW) to generate latent watermarks based on image characteristics and the Adversarial Watermarking Modulation module to prevent "jailbreaking" via personalized finetuning. To enhance U-Net's efficiency in learning watermark patterns with limited samples, we propose Efficient Concept Watermark Finetuning, which alternates optimization of model parameters for both watermark embedding and concept learning. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify our framework. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Conceptwm-4EB3/.</p></details> |  | None |

The framework synthesizes CT and MR images from segmentation masks derived from real patient data and XCAT digital phantoms, achieving a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.94 +/- 0.02 for CT and 0.89 +/- 0.04 for MR images compared to ground-truth images of real patients. It also achieves a Feature Similarity Index Measure (FSIM) of 0.78 +/- 0.04 for CT images from XCAT. The generative quality is further supported by a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.62 for CT image generation. Additionally, seg2med can generate paired CT and MR images with consistent anatomical structures and convert images between CT and MR modalities, achieving SSIM values of 0.91 +/- 0.03 for MR-to-CT and 0.77 +/- 0.04 for CT-to-MR conversion. Despite the limitations of incomplete anatomical details in segmentation masks, the framework shows strong performance in cross-modality synthesis and multimodal imaging. seg2med also demonstrates high anatomical fidelity in CT synthesis, achieving a mean Dice coefficient greater than 0.90 for 11 abdominal organs and greater than 0.80 for 34 organs out of 59 in 58 test cases. The highest Dice of 0.96 +/- 0.01 was recorded for the right scapula. Leveraging the TotalSegmentator toolkit, seg2med enables segmentation mask generation across diverse datasets, supporting applications in clinical imaging, data augmentation, multimodal synthesis, and diagnostic algorithm development.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

To investigate this, we introduce ViLP, a benchmark featuring deliberately out-of-distribution images synthesized via image generation models and out-of-distribution Q&A pairs. Each question in ViLP is coupled with three potential answers and three corresponding images: one that can be resolved by text priors alone and two that demand visual reasoning. Although, humans achieve near-perfect accuracy, modern VLMs falter; for instance, GPT-4 achieves only 66.17% on ViLP. To alleviate this, we propose a self-improving framework in which models generate new VQA data, then apply pixel-level and semantic corruptions to form "good-bad" image pairs for self-training. Our training objectives compel VLMs to focus more on the actual visual inputs, and we demonstrate their effectiveness in boosting the performance of open-source VLMs, including LLaVA-v1.5 and Cambrian.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vilp-team.github.io/</p></details> | None |

While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\bf{3 \space billion}$ parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://silentview.github.io/GigaTok</p></details> | [Code Link](https://silentview.github.io/GigaTok) |

However, generating faithful and high-fidelity images involving multiple entities interacting with each other, is a long-standing challenge. While pre-trained text-to-image models are trained on large-scale datasets to follow diverse text instructions, they struggle to generate accurate interactions, likely due to the scarcity of training data for uncommon object interactions. This paper introduces InterActing, an interaction-focused dataset with 1000 fine-grained prompts covering three key scenarios: (1) functional and action-based interactions, (2) compositional spatial relationships, and (3) multi-subject interactions. To address interaction generation challenges, we propose a decomposition-augmented refinement procedure. Our approach, DetailScribe, built on Stable Diffusion 3.5, leverages LLMs to decompose interactions into finer-grained concepts, uses a VLM to critique generated images, and applies targeted interventions within the diffusion process in refinement. Automatic and human evaluations show significantly improved image quality, demonstrating the potential of enhanced inference strategies.

Unlike conventional diffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion process in a compressed latent representation, improving computational efficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To validate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE effectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR associated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image generation and reconstruction while being computationally efficient. Experimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations demonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%) and age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic representations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible modifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong reconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month gap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance (SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal progression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE significantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing reconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework for scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a foundation model for medical image analysis.

This paper targets making classification models more robust to occlusions for the task of object recognition by proposing a pipeline that utilizes a frozen diffusion model. Diffusion features have demonstrated success in image generation and image completion while understanding image context. Occlusion can be posed as an image completion problem by deeming the pixels of the occluder to be `missing.' We hypothesize that such features can help hallucinate object visual features behind occluding objects, and hence we propose using them to enable models to become more occlusion robust. We design experiments to include input-based augmentations as well as feature-based augmentations. Input-based augmentations involve finetuning on images where the occluder pixels are inpainted, and feature-based augmentations involve augmenting classification features with intermediate diffusion features. We demonstrate that our proposed use of diffusion-based features results in models that are more robust to partial object occlusions for both Transformers and ConvNets on ImageNet with simulated occlusions. We also propose a dataset that encompasses real-world occlusions and demonstrate that our method is more robust to partial object occlusions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, applying DPO to video diffusion models faces critical challenges: (1) Data inefficiency. Generating thousands of videos per DPO iteration incurs prohibitive costs; (2) Evaluation uncertainty. Human annotations suffer from subjective bias, and automated discriminators fail to detect subtle temporal artifacts like flickering or motion incoherence. To address these, we propose a discriminator-free video DPO framework that: (1) Uses original real videos as win cases and their edited versions (e.g., reversed, shuffled, or noise-corrupted clips) as lose cases; (2) Trains video diffusion models to distinguish and avoid artifacts introduced by editing. This approach eliminates the need for costly synthetic video comparisons, provides unambiguous quality signals, and enables unlimited training data expansion through simple editing operations. We theoretically prove the framework's effectiveness even when real videos and model-generated videos follow different distributions. Experiments on CogVideoX demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.14167 by other authors</p></details> | None |

Although most state-of-the-art NSCs are trained as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models (DMs), a recent class of generative models, represent a promising alternative due to their superior performance in image generation relative to GANs. Consequently, DMs have been successfully applied for audio and speech coding among various other audio generation applications. However, the design of diffusion-based NSCs has not yet been explored in a systematic way. We address this by providing a comprehensive analysis of diffusion-based NSCs divided into three contributions. First, we propose a categorization based on the conditioning and output domains of the DM. This simple conceptual framework allows us to define a design space for diffusion-based NSCs and to assign a category to existing approaches in the literature. Second, we systematically investigate unexplored designs by creating and evaluating new diffusion-based NSCs within the conceptual framework. Finally, we compare the proposed models to existing GAN and DM baselines through objective metrics and subjective listening tests.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-time deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to computational and memory constraints. We propose Muon-AD, a co-designed framework that integrates the Muon optimizer with attention distillation for real-time edge synthesis. By eliminating gradient conflicts through orthogonal parameter updates and dynamic pruning, Muon-AD achieves 3.2 times faster convergence compared to Stable Diffusion-TensorRT, while maintaining synthesis quality (15% lower FID, 4% higher SSIM). Our framework reduces peak memory to 7GB on Jetson Orin and enables 24FPS real-time generation through mixed-precision quantization and curriculum learning. Extensive experiments on COCO-Stuff and ImageNet-Texture demonstrate Muon-AD's Pareto-optimal efficiency-quality trade-offs. Here, we show a 65% reduction in communication overhead during distributed training and real-time 10s/image generation on edge GPUs. These advancements pave the way for democratizing high-quality visual synthesis in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, DiT inferencing is notoriously compute-intensive and incurs long latency even on datacenter-scale GPUs, primarily due to its iterative nature and heavy reliance on GEMM operations inherent to its encoder-based structure. To address the challenge, prior work has explored quantization, but achieving low-precision quantization for DiT inferencing with both high accuracy and substantial speedup remains an open problem. To this end, this paper proposes MixDiT, an algorithm-hardware co-designed acceleration solution that exploits mixed Microscaling (MX) formats to quantize DiT activation values. MixDiT quantizes the DiT activation tensors by selectively applying higher precision to magnitude-based outliers, which produce mixed-precision GEMM operations. To achieve tangible speedup from the mixed-precision arithmetic, we design a MixDiT accelerator that enables precision-flexible multiplications and efficient MX precision conversions. Our experimental results show that MixDiT delivers a speedup of 2.10-5.32 times over RTX 3090, with no loss in FID.</p></details> |  | None |

Racial bias has not been explored thoroughly in the deep forgery detection field. In the paper, we first contribute a dedicated dataset called the Fair Forgery Detection (FairFD) dataset, where we prove the racial bias of public state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Different from existing forgery detection datasets, the self-constructed FairFD dataset contains a balanced racial ratio and diverse forgery generation images with the largest-scale subjects. Additionally, we identify the problems with naive fairness metrics when benchmarking forgery detection models. To comprehensively evaluate fairness, we design novel metrics including Approach Averaged Metric and Utility Regularized Metric, which can avoid deceptive results. We also present an effective and robust post-processing technique, Bias Pruning with Fair Activations (BPFA), which improves fairness without requiring retraining or weight updates.

However, many generated images still suffer from issues related to perceptual quality and text-image alignment. Given the high cost and inefficiency of manual evaluation, an automatic metric that aligns with human preferences is desirable. To this end, we present EvalMi-50K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating large-multimodal image generation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 2,100 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, and (ii) large-scale human-preference annotations, including 100K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 50K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 50,400 images generated from 24 T2I models. Based on EvalMi-50K, we propose LMM4LMM, an LMM-based metric for evaluating large multimodal T2I generation from multiple dimensions including perception, text-image correspondence, and task-specific accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that LMM4LMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EvalMi-50K, and exhibits strong generalization ability on other AI-generated image evaluation benchmark datasets, manifesting the generality of both the EvalMi-50K dataset and LMM4LMM metric. Both EvalMi-50K and LMM4LMM will be released at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4LMM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4LMM) |

The generated images often show significant errors with respect to the epipolar constraints that should be fulfilled, as given by the target pose. In this paper we address this issue by proposing a methodology to improve the geometric correctness of images generated by a diffusion model for single image NVS. We formulate a loss function based on image matching and epipolar constraints, and optimize the starting noise in a diffusion sampling process such that the generated image should both be a realistic image and fulfill geometric constraints derived from the given target pose. Our method does not require training data or fine-tuning of the diffusion models, and we show that we can apply it to multiple state-of-the-art models for single image NVS. The method is evaluated on the MegaScenes dataset and we show that geometric consistency is improved compared to the baseline models while retaining the quality of the generated images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 EDGE Workshop.

We propose a novel framework CoProSketch, providing prominent controllability and details for sketch generation with diffusion models. A straightforward method is fine-tuning a pretrained image generation diffusion model with binarized sketch images. However, we find that the diffusion models fail to generate clear binary images, which makes the produced sketches chaotic. We thus propose to represent the sketches by unsigned distance field (UDF), which is continuous and can be easily decoded to sketches through a lightweight network. With CoProSketch, users generate a rough sketch from a bounding box and a text prompt. The rough sketch can be manually edited and fed back into the model for iterative refinement and will be decoded to a detailed sketch as the final result. Additionally, we curate the first large-scale text-sketch paired dataset as the training data. Experiments demonstrate superior semantic consistency and controllability over baselines, offering a practical solution for integrating user feedback into generative workflows.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Particle Hit Clustering and Identification Using Point Set Transformers in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08182v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Liquid argon time projection chambers are often used in neutrino physics and dark-matter searches because of their high spatial resolution. The images generated by these detectors are extremely sparse, as the energy values detected by most of the detector are equal to 0, meaning that despite their high resolution, most of the detector is unused in a particular interaction. Instead of representing all of the empty detections, the interaction is usually stored as a sparse matrix, a list of detection locations paired with their energy values. Traditional machine learning methods that have been applied to particle reconstruction such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), however, cannot operate over data stored in this way and therefore must have the matrix fully instantiated as a dense matrix. Operating on dense matrices requires a lot of memory and computation time, in contrast to directly operating on the sparse matrix. We propose a machine learning model using a point set neural network that operates over a sparse matrix, greatly improving both processing speed and accuracy over methods that instantiate the dense matrix, as well as over other methods that operate over sparse matrices. Compared to competing state-of-the-art methods, our method improves classification performance by 14%, segmentation performance by more than 22%, while taking 80% less time and using 66% less memory. Compared to state-of-the-art CNN methods, our method improves classification performance by more than 86%, segmentation performance by more than 71%, while reducing runtime by 91% and reducing memory usage by 61%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, for submission at JINST</p></details> | None |

While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs.

Also, fine-tuning pre-trained general models has been a challenge due to the distribution shift between the medical domain and the pre-trained models. Here, we propose Latent Drift (LD) for diffusion models that can be adopted for any fine-tuning method to mitigate the issues faced by the distribution shift or employed in inference time as a condition. Latent Drifting enables diffusion models to be conditioned for medical images fitted for the complex task of counterfactual image generation, which is crucial to investigate how parameters such as gender, age, and adding or removing diseases in a patient would alter the medical images. We evaluate our method on three public longitudinal benchmark datasets of brain MRI and chest X-rays for counterfactual image generation. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains in various scenarios when combined with different fine-tuning schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 (highlight)</p></details> | None |

Beyond generation, object-level image editing remains a challenging problem, requiring precise modifications while preserving visual coherence. Existing text-based instructional editing methods struggle with localized shape and layout transformations, often introducing unintended global changes. Image interaction-based approaches offer better accuracy but require manual human effort to provide precise guidance. To reduce this manual effort while maintaining a high image editing accuracy, in this paper, we propose POEM, a framework for Precise Object-level Editing using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). POEM leverages MLLMs to analyze instructional prompts and generate precise object masks before and after transformation, enabling fine-grained control without extensive user input. This structured reasoning stage guides the diffusion-based editing process, ensuring accurate object localization and transformation. To evaluate our approach, we introduce VOCEdits, a benchmark dataset based on PASCAL VOC 2012, augmented with instructional edit prompts, ground-truth transformations, and precise object masks. Experimental results show that POEM outperforms existing text-based image editing approaches in precision and reliability while reducing manual effort compared to interaction-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SCIA 2025</p></details> | None |

Recent advances, especially the GPT-4o, have demonstrated the feasibility of high-fidelity multimodal generation, their architectural design remains mysterious and unpublished. This prompts the question of whether image and text generation have already been successfully integrated into a unified framework for those methods. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of GPT-4o's image generation capabilities, benchmarking it against leading open-source and commercial models. Our evaluation covers four main categories, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, and image-to-X generation, with more than 20 tasks. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of GPT-4o under various settings, and situates it within the broader evolution of generative modeling. Through this investigation, we identify promising directions for future unified generative models, emphasizing the role of architectural design and data scaling.

However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs. While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://visualcloze.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, the predominant approach for obtaining diverse sets is not sample-efficient, as it involves independently obtaining many samples from the source distribution and mapping them through the flow until the desired mode coverage is achieved. As an alternative to repeated sampling, we introduce DiverseFlow: a training-free approach to improve the diversity of flow models. Our key idea is to employ a determinantal point process to induce a coupling between the samples that drives diversity under a fixed sampling budget. In essence, DiverseFlow allows exploration of more variations in a learned flow model with fewer samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for tasks where sample-efficient diversity is desirable, such as text-guided image generation with polysemous words, inverse problems like large-hole inpainting, and class-conditional image synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent progress in generative AI, such as image generation, provides a disruptive technological solution to supporting human creativity further and helping humans generate solutions faster. While AI image generators can help to rapidly visualize ideas based on user prompts, the use of such AI systems has also been critiqued due to their considerable energy usage. In this paper, we report on a user study (N = 24) to understand whether energy consumption can be reduced without impeding on the tool's perceived creativity support. Our results highlight that, for example, a main effect of (image generation) condition on energy consumption, and index of creativity support per prompt but not per task, which seem mainly attributed to image quantity per prompt. We provide details of our analysis on the relation between energy usage, creativity support, and prompting behavior, including attitudes towards designing with AI and its environmental impact.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures | None |

These models are widely used for data augmentation and creative applications. However, DMs reflect the biases present in the training datasets. This is especially concerning in the context of faces, where the DM prefers one demographic subgroup vs others (eg. female vs male). In this work, we present a method for debiasing DMs without relying on additional data or model retraining. Specifically, we propose Distribution Guidance, which enforces the generated images to follow the prescribed attribute distribution. To realize this, we build on the key insight that the latent features of denoising UNet hold rich demographic semantics, and the same can be leveraged to guide debiased generation. We train Attribute Distribution Predictor (ADP) - a small mlp that maps the latent features to the distribution of attributes. ADP is trained with pseudo labels generated from existing attribute classifiers. The proposed Distribution Guidance with ADP enables us to do fair generation. Our method reduces bias across single/multiple attributes and outperforms the baseline by a significant margin for unconditional and text-conditional diffusion models. Further, we present a downstream task of training a fair attribute classifier by rebalancing the training set with our generated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

In this work, we address the problem of multi-object orientation control in text-to-image diffusion models. This enables the generation of diverse multi-object scenes with precise orientation control for each object. The key idea is to condition the diffusion model with a set of orientation-aware \textbf{compass} tokens, one for each object, along with text tokens. A light-weight encoder network predicts these compass tokens taking object orientation as the input. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of procedurally generated scenes, each containing one or two 3D assets on a plain background. However, direct training this framework results in poor orientation control as well as leads to entanglement among objects. To mitigate this, we intervene in the generation process and constrain the cross-attention maps of each compass token to its corresponding object regions. The trained model is able to achieve precise orientation control for a) complex objects not seen during training and b) multi-object scenes with more than two objects, indicating strong generalization capabilities. Further, when combined with personalization methods, our method precisely controls the orientation of the new object in diverse contexts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art orientation control and text alignment, quantified with extensive evaluations and a user study.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera Ready.

Existing methods typically face inherent trade-offs between identity preservation and personalized manipulation. We introduce FlexIP, a novel framework that decouples these objectives through two dedicated components: a Personalization Adapter for stylistic manipulation and a Preservation Adapter for identity maintenance. By explicitly injecting both control mechanisms into the generative model, our framework enables flexible parameterized control during inference through dynamic tuning of the weight adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach breaks through the performance limitations of conventional methods, achieving superior identity preservation while supporting more diverse personalized generation capabilities (Project Page: https://flexip-tech.github.io/flexip/).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://flexip-tech.github.io/flexip) |

Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner.

Previous research focuses on the general differences between generated images and real images, often overlooking the discrepancies among various generative techniques. In this paper, we explore the intrinsic relationship between synthetic images and their corresponding generation technologies. We find that specific images exhibit significant reconstruction discrepancies across different generative methods and that matching generation techniques provide more accurate reconstructions. Based on this insight, we propose a Multi-Reconstruction-based detector. By reversing and reconstructing images using multiple generative models, we analyze the reconstruction differences among real, GAN-generated, and DM-generated images to facilitate effective differentiation. Additionally, we introduce the Asian Synthetic Face Dataset (ASFD), containing synthetic Asian faces generated with various GANs and DMs. This dataset complements existing synthetic face datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our detector achieves exceptional performance, with strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures | None |

In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8, OpenWebText, and token-based image generation on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity.

Methods like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter excel at following sketches by seasoned artists but tend to be overly rigid, replicating unintentional flaws in sketches from novice users. Meanwhile, coarse-grained methods, such as sketch-based abstraction frameworks, offer more accessible input handling but lack the precise control needed for detailed, professional use. To address these limitations, we propose KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement. The relative strength of these two modules can be adjusted through our knob inference mechanism to align with the user's specific needs. These mechanisms ensure that KnobGen can flexibly generate images from both novice sketches and those drawn by seasoned artists. This maintains control over the final output while preserving the natural appearance of the image, as evidenced on the MultiGen-20M dataset and a newly collected sketch dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on CVEU</p></details> | None |

However, the field faces challenges in developing task-agnostic, reliable, and explainable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces CIGEval, a unified agentic framework for comprehensive evaluation of conditional image generation tasks.

Moreover, when implemented with 7B open-source LMMs using only 2.3K training trajectories, CIGEval surpasses the previous GPT-4o-based state-of-the-art method.

While existing benchmarks highlight GPT-4o's strong capabilities in image generation and editing, our evaluation reveals GPT-4o's persistent limitations: the model frequently defaults to literal interpretations of instructions, inconsistently applies knowledge constraints, and struggles with conditional reasoning tasks. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about GPT-4o's unified understanding and generation capabilities, exposing significant gaps in its dynamic knowledge integration.

However, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction between natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking techniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the target image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication onto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent watermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise. Yet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely on searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection. In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic information about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a distortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of key patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic embedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore, conditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves robustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two largely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial noise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker inserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image, possibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's increased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that content-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative models.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DyDiT++: Dynamic Diffusion Transformers for Efficient Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06803v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for visual generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the \emph{static} inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain \emph{diffusion timesteps} and \emph{spatial regions}. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose \textbf{Dy}namic \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformer (DyDiT), an architecture that \emph{dynamically} adjusts its computation along both \emph{timestep} and \emph{spatial} dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a \emph{Timestep-wise Dynamic Width} (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the generation timesteps. In addition, we design a \emph{Spatial-wise Dynamic Token} (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial locations. TDW and SDT can be seamlessly integrated into DiT and significantly accelerates the generation process. Building on these designs, we further enhance DyDiT in three key aspects. First, DyDiT is integrated seamlessly with flow matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended journal version for ICLR. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.03456</p></details> | None |
| **[A Meaningful Perturbation Metric for Evaluating Explainability Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06800v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success, yet their wide adoption is often hindered by their opaque decision-making. To address this, attribution methods have been proposed to assign relevance values to each part of the input. However, different methods often produce entirely different relevance maps, necessitating the development of standardized metrics to evaluate them. Typically, such evaluation is performed through perturbation, wherein high- or low-relevance regions of the input image are manipulated to examine the change in prediction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, which harnesses image generation models to perform targeted perturbation. Specifically, we focus on inpainting only the high-relevance pixels of an input image to modify the model's predictions while preserving image fidelity. This is in contrast to existing approaches, which often produce out-of-distribution modifications, leading to unreliable results. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating meaningful rankings across a wide range of models and attribution methods. Crucially, we establish that the ranking produced by our metric exhibits significantly higher correlation with human preferences compared to existing approaches, underscoring its potential for enhancing interpretability in DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, AI systems still struggle when it comes to understanding and interacting with the physical world. This reveals an important issue: relying solely on semantic-level concepts learned from internet data (e.g. texts, images) to understand the physical world is far from sufficient -- machine intelligence currently lacks an effective way to learn about the physical world. This research introduces the idea of analytic concept -- representing the concepts related to the physical world through programs of mathematical procedures, providing machine intelligence a portal to perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Except for detailing the design philosophy and providing guidelines for the application of analytic concepts, this research also introduce about the infrastructure that has been built around analytic concepts. I aim for my research to contribute to addressing these questions: What is a proper abstraction of general concepts in the physical world for machine intelligence? How to systematically integrate structured priors with neural networks to constrain AI systems to comply with physical laws?</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02514v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image autoregressive generation has emerged as a powerful new paradigm, with image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for higher generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns about their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to those of DMs as a reference point. Specifically, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images, with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% (TPR@FPR=1%) of 86.38%, compared to just 6.38% for DMs using comparable attacks. We leverage our novel MIA to perform dataset inference (DI) for IARs and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership, compared to 200 samples for DI in DMs. This confirms a higher level of information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance. This trend suggests that incorporating techniques from DMs into IARs, such as modeling the per-token probability distribution using a diffusion procedure, could help mitigate IARs' vulnerability to privacy attacks.

To generate long-form, high-quality captions, many recent studies have employed multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current MLLMs often produce captions that lack fine-grained details or suffer from hallucinations, a challenge that persists in both open-source and closed-source models. Inspired by Feature-Integration theory, which suggests that attention must focus on specific regions to integrate visual information effectively, we propose a \textbf{divide-then-aggregate} strategy. Our method first divides the image into semantic and spatial patches to extract fine-grained details, enhancing the model's local perception of the image. These local details are then hierarchically aggregated to generate a comprehensive global description. To address hallucinations and inconsistencies in the generated captions, we apply a semantic-level filtering process during hierarchical aggregation. This training-free pipeline can be applied to both open-source models (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-1.6, Mini-Gemini) and closed-source models (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, GLM-4V-Plus). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates more detailed, reliable captions, advancing multimodal description generation without requiring model retraining.

In this work, we consider the question of collision avoidance from an implicit environment model. We use monocular RGB images as inputs and train a collisionavoidance policy from photorealistic images generated by 2D Gaussian splatting. We evaluate the resulting pipeline in realworld experiments under velocity commands that bring the robot on an intercept course with obstacles. Our results suggest that RGB images can be enough to make collision-avoidance decisions, both in the room where training data was collected and in out-of-distribution environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that Meta-LoRA achieves superior identity retention, computational efficiency, and adaptability across diverse identity conditions. Our code, model weights, and dataset are released on barisbatuhan.github.io/Meta-LoRA.</p></details> |  | None |

Creating such posters using modern image generation methods is valuable, while the main challenge lies in accurately rendering text, especially for complex writing systems like Chinese, which contains over 10,000 individual characters. In this work, we identify the key to precise text rendering as constructing a character-discriminative visual feature as a control signal. Based on this insight, we propose a robust character-wise representation as control and we develop TextRenderNet, which achieves a high text rendering accuracy of over 90%. Another challenge in poster generation is maintaining the fidelity of user-specific products. We address this by introducing SceneGenNet, an inpainting-based model, and propose subject fidelity feedback learning to further enhance fidelity. Based on TextRenderNet and SceneGenNet, we present PosterMaker, an end-to-end generation framework. To optimize PosterMaker efficiently, we implement a two-stage training strategy that decouples text rendering and background generation learning.

To address these challenges, we explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains models to generate preferred (winning) images while diverging from non-preferred (losing) ones. However, conventional DPO methods use generated images as winning images, limiting realism. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced DPO approach that incorporates high-quality real images as winning images, encouraging outputs to resemble real images rather than generated ones. However, implementing this concept is not a trivial task. Therefore, our approach, HG-DPO (Human image Generation through DPO), employs a novel curriculum learning framework that gradually improves the output of the model toward greater realism, making training more feasible. Furthermore, HG-DPO effectively adapts to personalized text-to-image tasks, generating high-quality and identity-specific images, which highlights the practical value of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 as a highlight paper</p></details> | None |

However, they often lack a direct connection to object geometry, which is crucial in sensitive domains such as computational anatomy, biology, and robotics. This paper presents a novel framework for Image Generation informed by Geodesic dynamics (IGG) in deformation spaces. Our IGG model comprises two key components: (i) an efficient autoencoder that explicitly learns the geodesic path of image transformations in the latent space; and (ii) a latent geodesic diffusion model that captures the distribution of latent representations of geodesic deformations conditioned on text instructions. By leveraging geodesic paths, our method ensures smooth, topology-preserving, and interpretable deformations, capturing complex variations in image structures while maintaining geometric consistency. We validate the proposed IGG on plant growth data and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Experimental results show that IGG outperforms the state-of-the-art image generation/editing models with superior performance in generating realistic, high-quality images with preserved object topology and reduced artifacts.

We introduce MetaQueries, a set of learnable queries that act as an efficient interface between autoregressive multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models. MetaQueries connects the MLLM's latents to the diffusion decoder, enabling knowledge-augmented image generation by leveraging the MLLM's deep understanding and reasoning capabilities. Our method simplifies training, requiring only paired image-caption data and standard diffusion objectives. Notably, this transfer is effective even when the MLLM backbone remains frozen, thereby preserving its state-of-the-art multimodal understanding capabilities while achieving strong generative performance.

Still, high-resolution image synthesis presents formidable challenges due to the scarcity and complexity of high-resolution content. To this end, we present HiFlow, a training-free and model-agnostic framework to unlock the resolution potential of pre-trained flow models. Specifically, HiFlow establishes a virtual reference flow within the high-resolution space that effectively captures the characteristics of low-resolution flow information, offering guidance for high-resolution generation through three key aspects: initialization alignment for low-frequency consistency, direction alignment for structure preservation, and acceleration alignment for detail fidelity. By leveraging this flow-aligned guidance, HiFlow substantially elevates the quality of high-resolution image synthesis of T2I models and demonstrates versatility across their personalized variants. Extensive experiments validate HiFlow's superiority in achieving superior high-resolution image quality over current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

While large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have demonstrated impressive generation quality, they often suffer from style misalignment across generated image sets and slow inference speeds, limiting their practical usability. To address these issues, we propose three key components: initial feature replacement to ensure consistent background appearance, pivotal feature interpolation to align object placement, and dynamic style injection, which reinforces style consistency using a schedule function. Unlike previous methods requiring fine-tuning or additional training, our approach maintains fast inference while preserving individual content details. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves generation quality comparable to competing approaches, significantly improves style alignment, and delivers inference speeds over six times faster than the fastest model.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures | None |

However, in this paper, we reveal that T2I-DMs equipped with the IP-Adapter (T2I-IP-DMs) enable a new jailbreak attack named the hijacking attack. We demonstrate that, by uploading imperceptible image-space adversarial examples (AEs), the adversary can hijack massive benign users to jailbreak an Image Generation Service (IGS) driven by T2I-IP-DMs and mislead the public to discredit the service provider. Worse still, the IP-Adapter's dependency on open-source image encoders reduces the knowledge required to craft AEs. Extensive experiments verify the technical feasibility of the hijacking attack.

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results.

| **[Your Image Generator Is Your New Private Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04582v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools to synthetically produce training data, offering potential solutions to data scarcity and reducing labelling costs for downstream supervised deep learning applications. However, effectively leveraging text-conditioned image generation for building classifier training sets requires addressing key issues: constructing informative textual prompts, adapting generative models to specific domains, and ensuring robust performance. This paper proposes the Text-Conditioned Knowledge Recycling (TCKR) pipeline to tackle these challenges. TCKR combines dynamic image captioning, parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning, and Generative Knowledge Distillation techniques to create synthetic datasets tailored for image classification. The pipeline is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse image classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that models trained solely on TCKR-generated data achieve classification accuracies on par with (and in several cases exceeding) models trained on real images. Furthermore, the evaluation reveals that these synthetic-data-trained models exhibit substantially enhanced privacy characteristics: their vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks is significantly reduced, with the membership inference AUC lowered by 5.49 points on average compared to using real training data, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the performance-privacy trade-off. These findings indicate that high-fidelity synthetic data can effectively replace real data for training classifiers, yielding strong performance whilst simultaneously providing improved privacy protection as a valuable emergent property. The code and trained models are available in the accompanying open-source repository.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Storybooth: Training-free Multi-Subject Consistency for Improved Visual Storytelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05800v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free consistent text-to-image generation depicting the same subjects across different images is a topic of widespread recent interest. Existing works in this direction predominantly rely on cross-frame self-attention; which improves subject-consistency by allowing tokens in each frame to pay attention to tokens in other frames during self-attention computation. While useful for single subjects, we find that it struggles when scaling to multiple characters. In this work, we first analyze the reason for these limitations. Our exploration reveals that the primary-issue stems from self-attention-leakage, which is exacerbated when trying to ensure consistency across multiple-characters. This happens when tokens from one subject pay attention to other characters, causing them to appear like each other (e.g., a dog appearing like a duck). Motivated by these findings, we propose StoryBooth: a training-free approach for improving multi-character consistency. In particular, we first leverage multi-modal chain-of-thought reasoning and region-based generation to apriori localize the different subjects across the desired story outputs. The final outputs are then generated using a modified diffusion model which consists of two novel layers: 1) a bounded cross-frame self-attention layer for reducing inter-character attention leakage, and 2) token-merging layer for improving consistency of fine-grain subject details. Through both qualitative and quantitative results we find that the proposed approach surpasses prior state-of-the-art, exhibiting improved consistency across both multiple-characters and fine-grain subject details.</p></details> |  | None |

As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints.

However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Lakonik/GMFlow</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Lakonik/GMFlow) |

Despite its advancements, cultural biases in AI-generated images have raised significant concerns. While much research has focused on issues within Western contexts, our study examines the perceived biases regarding the portrayal of East Asian women. In this exploratory study, we invited East Asian users to audit three popular models (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) and identified 18 specific perceived biases, categorized into four patterns: Westernization, overuse or misuse of cultural symbols, sexualization & feminization, and racial stereotypes. This work highlights the potential challenges posed by AI models in portraying Eastern individuals.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, some works have utilized adversarial attacks to protect copyright. However, all these works focus on single-image generation tasks which only need to consider the inner feature of images. Previous methods are inefficient in attacking MVDMs because they lack the consideration of disrupting the geometric and visual consistency among the generated multi-view images. This paper is the first to address the intellectual property infringement issue arising from MVDMs. Accordingly, we propose a novel latent feature and attention dual erasure attack to disrupt the distribution of latent feature and the consistency across the generated images from multi-view and multi-domain simultaneously. The experiments conducted on SOTA MVDMs indicate that our approach achieves superior performances in terms of attack effectiveness, transferability, and robustness against defense methods. Therefore, this paper provides an efficient solution to protect 3D assets from MVDMs-based 3D geometry reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> | None |

By utilizing a small set of user-provided examples featuring the same subject, PCS aims to tailor this subject to specific user-defined prompts. Over the past two years, more than 150 methods have been introduced in this area. However, existing surveys primarily focus on text-to-image generation, with few providing up-to-date summaries on PCS. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of PCS, introducing the general frameworks of PCS research, which can be categorized into test-time fine-tuning (TTF) and pre-trained adaptation (PTA) approaches. We analyze the strengths, limitations, and key techniques of these methodologies. Additionally, we explore specialized tasks within the field, such as object, face, and style personalization, while highlighting their unique challenges and innovations. Despite the promising progress, we also discuss ongoing challenges, including overfitting and the trade-off between subject fidelity and text alignment. Through this detailed overview and analysis, we propose future directions to further the development of PCS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnyArtisticGlyph: Multilingual Controllable Artistic Glyph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04743v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artistic Glyph Image Generation (AGIG) differs from current creativity-focused generation models by offering finely controllable deterministic generation. It transfers the style of a reference image to a source while preserving its content. Although advanced and promising, current methods may reveal flaws when scrutinizing synthesized image details, often producing blurred or incorrect textures, posing a significant challenge. Hence, we introduce AnyArtisticGlyph, a diffusion-based, multilingual controllable artistic glyph generation model. It includes a font fusion and embedding module, which generates latent features for detailed structure creation, and a vision-text fusion and embedding module that uses the CLIP model to encode references and blends them with transformation caption embeddings for seamless global image generation. Moreover, we incorporate a coarse-grained feature-level loss to enhance generation accuracy. Experiments show that it produces natural, detailed artistic glyph images with state-of-the-art performance. Our project will be open-sourced on https://github.com/jiean001/AnyArtisticGlyph to advance text generation technology.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jiean001/AnyArtisticGlyph) |
| **[MLLM-as-a-Judge for Image Safety without Human Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00192v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image content safety has become a significant challenge with the rise of visual media on online platforms. Meanwhile, in the age of AI-generated content (AIGC), many image generation models are capable of producing harmful content, such as images containing sexual or violent material. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard, given their strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically fine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets, which however brings a series of drawbacks. First, relying on human annotators to label data following intricate and detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, users of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules, making fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the research question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot setting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our research showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield satisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the subjectivity of safety rules, the complexity of lengthy constitutions, and the inherent biases in the models. To address these challenges, we propose a MLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules, assessing the relevance between rules and images, making quick judgments based on debiased token probabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for safety rules, and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thought processes if necessary. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is highly effective for zero-shot image safety judgment tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

These models excel not only in creating fixed-size images but also in producing panoramic images. However, existing methods often struggle with spatial layout consistency when producing high-resolution panoramas due to the lack of guidance on the global image layout. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Diffusion (MSD), an optimized framework that extends the panoramic image generation framework to multiple resolution levels. Our method leverages gradient descent techniques to incorporate structural information from low-resolution images into high-resolution outputs. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations against prior work, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the coherence of high-resolution panorama generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Attributed Synthetic Data Generation for Zero-shot Domain-specific Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04510v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot domain-specific image classification is challenging in classifying real images without ground-truth in-domain training examples. Recent research involved knowledge from texts with a text-to-image model to generate in-domain training images in zero-shot scenarios. However, existing methods heavily rely on simple prompt strategies, limiting the diversity of synthetic training images, thus leading to inferior performance compared to real images. In this paper, we propose AttrSyn, which leverages large language models to generate attributed prompts. These prompts allow for the generation of more diverse attributed synthetic images. Experiments for zero-shot domain-specific image classification on two fine-grained datasets show that training with synthetic images generated by AttrSyn significantly outperforms CLIP's zero-shot classification under most situations and consistently surpasses simple prompt strategies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TerDiT: Ternary Diffusion Models with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14854v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the generation of high-fidelity images, particularly with the emergence of diffusion transformer models (DiTs). Among diffusion models, diffusion transformers have demonstrated superior image-generation capabilities, boosting lower FID scores and higher scalability. However, deploying large-scale DiT models can be expensive due to their excessive parameter numbers. Although existing research has explored efficient deployment techniques for diffusion models, such as model quantization, there is still little work concerning DiT-based models. To tackle this research gap, we propose TerDiT, the first quantization-aware training (QAT) and efficient deployment scheme for extremely low-bit diffusion transformer models. We focus on the ternarization of DiT networks, with model sizes ranging from 600M to 4.2B, and image resolution from 256$\times$256 to 512$\times$512. Our work contributes to the exploration of efficient deployment of large-scale DiT models, demonstrating the feasibility of training extremely low-bit DiT models from scratch while maintaining competitive image generation capacities compared to full-precision models. Our code and pre-trained TerDiT checkpoints have been released at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/TerDiT.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/TerDiT) |

| **[FRAP: Faithful and Realistic Text-to-Image Generation with Adaptive Prompt Weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11706v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation of the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality. We release the code at the following link: https://github.com/LiyaoJiang1998/FRAP/.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/LiyaoJiang1998/FRAP) |
| **[Language-Guided Image Tokenization for Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05796v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image tokenization, the process of transforming raw image pixels into a compact low-dimensional latent representation, has proven crucial for scalable and efficient image generation. However, mainstream image tokenization methods generally have limited compression rates, making high-resolution image generation computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage language for efficient image tokenization, and we call our method Text-Conditioned Image Tokenization (TexTok). TexTok is a simple yet effective tokenization framework that leverages language to provide a compact, high-level semantic representation. By conditioning the tokenization process on descriptive text captions, TexTok simplifies semantic learning, allowing more learning capacity and token space to be allocated to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to enhanced reconstruction quality and higher compression rates. Compared to the conventional tokenizer without text conditioning, TexTok achieves average reconstruction FID improvements of 29.2% and 48.1% on ImageNet-256 and -512 benchmarks respectively, across varying numbers of tokens. These tokenization improvements consistently translate to 16.3% and 34.3% average improvements in generation FID. By simply replacing the tokenizer in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with TexTok, our system can achieve a 93.5x inference speedup while still outperforming the original DiT using only 32 tokens on ImageNet-512. TexTok with a vanilla DiT generator achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.46 and 1.62 on ImageNet-256 and -512 respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate TexTok's superiority on the text-to-image generation task, effectively utilizing the off-the-shelf text captions in tokenization.

| **[DreamRelation: Bridging Customization and Relation Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23280v4)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized image generation is essential for creating personalized content based on user prompts, allowing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to more effectively meet individual needs. However, existing models often neglect the relationships between customized objects in generated images. In contrast, this work addresses this gap by focusing on relation-aware customized image generation, which seeks to preserve the identities from image prompts while maintaining the relationship specified in text prompts. Specifically, we introduce DreamRelation, a framework that disentangles identity and relation learning using a carefully curated dataset. Our training data consists of relation-specific images, independent object images containing identity information, and text prompts to guide relation generation. Then, we propose two key modules to tackle the two main challenges: generating accurate and natural relationships, especially when significant pose adjustments are required, and avoiding object confusion in cases of overlap. First, we introduce a keypoint matching loss that effectively guides the model in adjusting object poses closely tied to their relationships. Second, we incorporate local features of the image prompts to better distinguish between objects, preventing confusion in overlapping cases. Extensive results on our proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DreamRelation in generating precise relations while preserving object identities across a diverse set of objects and relationships.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |
| **[SDEIT: Semantic-Driven Electrical Impedance Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04185v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization methods using prior knowledge are essential in solving ill-posed inverse problems such as Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). However, designing effective regularization and integrating prior information into EIT remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of anatomical structures. In this work, we introduce SDEIT, a novel semantic-driven framework that integrates Stable Diffusion 3.5 into EIT, marking the first use of large-scale text-to-image generation models in EIT. SDEIT employs natural language prompts as semantic priors to guide the reconstruction process. By coupling an implicit neural representation (INR) network with a plug-and-play optimization scheme that leverages SD-generated images as generative priors, SDEIT improves structural consistency and recovers fine details. Importantly, this method does not rely on paired training datasets, increasing its adaptability to varied EIT scenarios. Extensive experiments on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that SDEIT outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, offering superior accuracy and robustness. This work opens a new pathway for integrating multimodal priors into ill-posed inverse problems like EIT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gaussian Scenes: Pose-Free Sparse-View Scene Reconstruction using Depth-Enhanced Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15966v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a generative approach for pose-free (without camera parameters) reconstruction of 360 scenes from a sparse set of 2D images. Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://gaussianscenes.github.io/</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose Retinal Layout-Aware Diffusion (RLAD), a novel diffusion-based framework for generating controllable layout-aware images. RLAD conditions image generation on multiple key layout components extracted from real images, ensuring high structural fidelity while enabling diversity in other components. Applied to retinal fundus imaging, we augmented the training datasets by synthesizing paired retinal images and vessel segmentations conditioned on extracted blood vessels from real images, while varying other layout components such as lesions and the optic disc. Experiments demonstrated that RLAD-generated data improved generalization in retinal vessel segmentation by up to 8.1%.

| **[A Simple Approach to Unifying Diffusion-based Conditional Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11439v3)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in image generation has sparked research into controlling these models through condition signals, with various methods addressing specific challenges in conditional generation. Instead of proposing another specialized technique, we introduce a simple, unified framework to handle diverse conditional generation tasks involving a specific image-condition correlation. By learning a joint distribution over a correlated image pair (e.g. image and depth) with a diffusion model, our approach enables versatile capabilities via different inference-time sampling schemes, including controllable image generation (e.g. depth to image), estimation (e.g. image to depth), signal guidance, joint generation (image & depth), and coarse control. Previous attempts at unification often introduce significant complexity through multi-stage training, architectural modification, or increased parameter counts. In contrast, our simple formulation requires a single, computationally efficient training stage, maintains the standard model input, and adds minimal learned parameters (15% of the base model). Moreover, our model supports additional capabilities like non-spatially aligned and coarse conditioning. Extensive results show that our single model can produce comparable results with specialized methods and better results than prior unified methods. We also demonstrate that multiple models can be effectively combined for multi-signal conditional generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lixirui142.github.io/unicon-diffusion/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://lixirui142.github.io/unicon-diffusion) |
