| **[FLUX-Reason-6M & PRISM-Bench: A Million-Scale Text-to-Image Reasoning Dataset and Comprehensive Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09680v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark). FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese) descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation.

| **[Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[SV-DRR: High-Fidelity Novel View X-Ray Synthesis Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05148v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis. Our code is available at GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Prompt Pirates Need a Map: Stealing Seeds helps Stealing Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09488v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic images conditioned on textual prompts and seeds. Given the considerable intellectual and economic value embedded in such prompts, prompt theft poses a critical security and privacy concern. In this paper, we investigate prompt-stealing attacks targeting diffusion models. We reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are fundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used during image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation vulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks, originating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$ when generating the initial random noise on CPUs. Through a large-scale empirical analysis conducted on images shared via the popular platform CivitAI, we demonstrate that approximately 95% of these images' seed values can be effectively brute-forced in 140 minutes per seed using our seed-recovery tool, SeedSnitch. Leveraging the recovered seed, we propose PromptPirate, a genetic algorithm-based optimization method explicitly designed for prompt stealing. PromptPirate surpasses state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PromptStealer, P2HP, and CLIP-Interrogator, achieving an 8-11% improvement in LPIPS similarity. Furthermore, we introduce straightforward and effective countermeasures that render seed stealing, and thus optimization-based prompt stealing, ineffective. We have disclosed our findings responsibly and initiated coordinated mitigation efforts with the developers to address this critical vulnerability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Total Disentanglement of Font Images into Style and Character Class Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12784v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate a total disentanglement of font images. Total disentanglement is a neural network-based method for decomposing each font image nonlinearly and completely into its style and content (i.e., character class) features. It uses a simple but careful training procedure to extract the common style feature from all `A'-`Z' images in the same font and the common content feature from all `A' (or another class) images in different fonts. These disentangled features guarantee the reconstruction of the original font image. Various experiments have been conducted to understand the performance of total disentanglement. First, it is demonstrated that total disentanglement is achievable with very high accuracy; this is experimental proof of the long-standing open question, ``Does `A'-ness exist?'' Hofstadter (1985). Second, it is demonstrated that the disentangled features produced by total disentanglement apply to a variety of tasks, including font recognition, character recognition, and one-shot font image generation.

| **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v5)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.VLJailbreakBench is publicly available at https://roywang021.github.io/VLJailbreakBench.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://roywang021.github.io/VLJailbreakBench) |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Parasite-1715/.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Integrating Anatomical Priors into a Causal Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09054v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses, particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches. Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature. This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon (Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models, finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American people in media professions.

| **[GenFlow: Interactive Modular System for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21369v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative art unlocks boundless creative possibilities, yet its full potential remains untapped due to the technical expertise required for advanced architectural concepts and computational workflows. To bridge this gap, we present GenFlow, a novel modular framework that empowers users of all skill levels to generate images with precision and ease. Featuring a node-based editor for seamless customization and an intelligent assistant powered by natural language processing, GenFlow transforms the complexity of workflow creation into an intuitive and accessible experience. By automating deployment processes and minimizing technical barriers, our framework makes cutting-edge generative art tools available to everyone. A user study demonstrated GenFlow's ability to optimize workflows, reduce task completion times, and enhance user understanding through its intuitive interface and adaptive features. These results position GenFlow as a groundbreaking solution that redefines accessibility and efficiency in the realm of generative art.</p></details> | CBMI 2025 | None |
| **[RoentMod: A Synthetic Chest X-Ray Modification Model to Identify and Correct Image Interpretation Model Shortcuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08640v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine. Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts, limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 + ...</summary><p>25 + 8 pages, 4 + 7 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[F-Bench: Rethinking Human Preference Evaluation Metrics for Benchmarking Face Generation, Customization, and Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13155v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence generative models exhibit remarkable capabilities in content creation, particularly in face image generation, customization, and restoration. However, current AI-generated faces (AIGFs) often fall short of human preferences due to unique distortions, unrealistic details, and unexpected identity shifts, underscoring the need for a comprehensive quality evaluation framework for AIGFs. To address this need, we introduce FaceQ, a large-scale, comprehensive database of AI-generated Face images with fine-grained Quality annotations reflecting human preferences. The FaceQ database comprises 12,255 images generated by 29 models across three tasks: (1) face generation, (2) face customization, and (3) face restoration. It includes 32,742 mean opinion scores (MOSs) from 180 annotators, assessed across multiple dimensions: quality, authenticity, identity (ID) fidelity, and text-image correspondence. Using the FaceQ database, we establish F-Bench, a benchmark for comparing and evaluating face generation, customization, and restoration models, highlighting strengths and weaknesses across various prompts and evaluation dimensions. Additionally, we assess the performance of existing image quality assessment (IQA), face quality assessment (FQA), AI-generated content image quality assessment (AIGCIQA), and preference evaluation metrics, manifesting that these standard metrics are relatively ineffective in evaluating authenticity, ID fidelity, and text-image correspondence. The FaceQ database will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Physics-Guided Rectified Flow for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08330v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image enhancement.</p></details> | 21pages,7figures | None |

In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks.

| **[Feature Space Analysis by Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07936v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains, this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into these DNNs' feature spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, codes: https://github.com/KimiakiShirahama/FeatureSpaceAnalysisByGuidedDiffusionModel</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/KimiakiShirahama/FeatureSpaceAnalysisByGuidedDiffusionModel) |
| **[Missing Fine Details in Images: Last Seen in High Frequencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, generated images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information during optimization, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Moreover, we integrate our frequency-preserving latent embeddings into a SOTA latent diffusion model, resulting in sharper and more realistic image generation. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image synthesis, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AgentX: Towards Orchestrating Robust Agentic Workflow Patterns with FaaS-hosted MCP Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07595v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has rapidly transformed various fields including code generation, text summarization, image generation and so on. Agentic AI is a recent evolution that further advances this by coupling the decision making and generative capabilities of LLMs with actions that can be performed using tools. While seemingly powerful, Agentic systems often struggle when faced with numerous tools, complex multi-step tasks,and long-context management to track history and avoid hallucinations. Workflow patterns such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct help address this. Here, we define a novel agentic workflow pattern, AgentX, composed of stage designer, planner, and executor agents that is competitive or better than the state-of-the-art agentic patterns. We also leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, and propose two alternative approaches for deploying MCP servers as cloud Functions as a Service (FaaS). We empirically evaluate the success rate, latency and cost for AgentX and two contemporary agentic patterns, ReAct and Magentic One, using these the FaaS and local MCP server alternatives for three practical applications. This highlights the opportunities and challenges of designing and deploying agentic workflows.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reconstruction Alignment Improves Unified Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07295v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 24 figures and 10 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data. Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965 resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias, generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting accountability and fairness in AI development.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interleaving Reasoning for Better Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06945v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL), which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation) |
| **[TIDE: Achieving Balanced Subject-Driven Image Generation via Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06499v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics.

While these models have shown promising performance, concerns have been raised regarding the potential misuse of the generated fake images. In response to this, we have presented a simple yet effective training-free method to attribute fake images generated by text-to-image models to their source models. Given a test image to be attributed, we first inverse the textual prompt of the image, and then put the reconstructed prompt into different candidate models to regenerate candidate fake images. By calculating and ranking the similarity of the test image and the candidate images, we can determine the source of the image. This attribution allows model owners to be held accountable for any misuse of their models. Note that our approach does not limit the number of candidate text-to-image generative models. Comprehensive experiments reveal that (1) Our method can effectively attribute fake images to their source models, achieving comparable attribution performance with the state-of-the-art method; (2) Our method has high scalability ability, which is well adapted to real-world attribution scenarios. (3) The proposed method yields satisfactory robustness to common attacks, such as Gaussian blurring, JPEG compression, and Resizing. We also analyze the factors that influence the attribution performance, and explore the boost brought by the proposed method as a plug-in to improve the performance of existing SOTA. We hope our work can shed some light on the solutions to addressing the source of AI-generated images, as well as to prevent the misuse of text-to-image generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been withdrawn by the authors because the proposed approach is currently undergoing optimization and improvement.

Unlike fully autoregressive models, Show-o unifies autoregressive and (discrete) diffusion modeling to adaptively handle inputs and outputs of various and mixed modalities. The unified model flexibly supports a wide range of vision-language tasks including visual question-answering, text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting/extrapolation, and mixed-modality generation. Across various benchmarks, it demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing individual models with an equivalent or larger number of parameters tailored for understanding or generation.

This paper looks at the duality of AI, exploring the ways that recent technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators are changing the fields of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and the arts of craft. Using examples and data, we illustrate the ways that AI can democratize creative expression, improve productivity, and preserve cultural heritage, while also examining the negative aspects, including: the threats to authenticity within art, ethical concerns around data, and issues including socio-economic factors such as job losses. While we argue for the context-dependence of the impact of AI (the potential for creative homogenization and the devaluation of human agency in artmaking), we also illustrate the potential for hybrid practices featuring AI in cuisine, etc. We advocate for the development of ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches, and inclusive technology development. In sum, we are articulating a vision of AI in which it amplifies our innate creativity while resisting the displacement of the cultural, nuanced, and emotional aspects of traditional art. The future will be determined by human choices about how to govern AI so that it becomes a mechanism for artistic evolution and not a substitute for the artist's soul.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making. We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models implement it.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear as a book chapter in a Springer book titled "Statistical Foundations and Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning" and edited by S.

HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090 GPUs, representing a significant reduction in computational requirements compared to traditional approaches.

This makes them highly promising for image reconstruction, where the goal is to recover a clean image from a degraded observation. In this work, we introduce a conditional sampling framework that leverages the powerful priors learned by diffusion models while enforcing consistency with the available measurements. To further adapt pre-trained diffusion models to the specific degradation at hand, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy. In particular, we employ LoRA-based adaptation using images that are semantically and visually similar to the degraded input, efficiently retrieved from a large and diverse dataset via an off-the-shelf vision-language model. We evaluate our approach on two leading publicly available diffusion models--Stable Diffusion and Guided Diffusion--and demonstrate that our method, termed Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction (ADIR), yields substantial improvements across a range of image reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page https://shadyabh.github.io/ADIR/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://shadyabh.github.io/ADIR) |

Critically, comparable pretrained foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure. Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

Flow-based generative models provide a powerful framework for capturing complex probability distributions, offering exact likelihood estimation, efficient sampling, and deterministic transformations between distributions. These models leverage invertible mappings governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), enabling precise density estimation and likelihood evaluation. This tutorial presents an intuitive mathematical framework for flow-based generative models, formulating them as neural network-based representations of continuous probability densities. We explore key theoretical principles, including the Wasserstein metric, gradient flows, and density evolution governed by ODEs, to establish convergence guarantees and bridge empirical advancements with theoretical insights. By providing a rigorous yet accessible treatment, we aim to equip researchers and practitioners with the necessary tools to effectively apply flow-based generative models in signal processing and machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, Special Issue on The Mathematics of Deep Learning, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing character editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential practical applications in the environment.</p></details> | 7pages, 4 figures | None |

However, acquiring sufficient data is often challenging and costly. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in high-quality image synthesis and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel framework called LLM-assisted Paired Image Generation (LaPIG). This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional approaches are labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation, and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation infrastructure planning and facility design.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures | None |

Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, these models are vulnerable to misuse, particularly generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as sexually explicit, violent, political, and disturbing images, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. We further enhance its reliability and helpfulness through a divide-and-conquer strategy, which optimizes category-specific soft prompts and combines them into holistic safety guidance. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 3.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 14 tables</p></details> | None |

A key challenge in this task is balancing category consistency and image diversity, which often compete with each other. Moreover, existing methods offer limited control over the attributes of newly generated images. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Diffusion Autoencoders (HypDAE), a novel approach that operates in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical relationships among images from seen categories. By leveraging pre-trained foundation models, HypDAE generates diverse new images for unseen categories with exceptional quality by varying stochastic subcodes or semantic codes. Most importantly, the hyperbolic representation introduces an additional degree of control over semantic diversity through the adjustment of radii within the hyperbolic disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HypDAE significantly outperforms prior methods by achieving a better balance between preserving category-relevant features and promoting image diversity with limited data. Furthermore, HypDAE offers a highly controllable and interpretable generation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Code is available at: https://github.com/lingxiao-li/HypDAE</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/lingxiao-li/HypDAE) |

However, existing diffusion parallelism inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy, demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on heterogeneous GPUs.</p></details> |  | None |

Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many prominent open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as Skywork UniPic 2.0.</p></details> |  | None |

To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyunsoocha.github.io/durian</p></details> | [Code Link](https://hyunsoocha.github.io/durian) |

In this paper, we explore the potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models to address this issue.

Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.</p></details> | Accepted to ICIP2025 | None |
| **[Straighter Flow Matching via a Diffusion-Based Coupling Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16507v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching as a paradigm of generative model achieves notable success across various domains. However, existing methods use either multi-round training or knowledge within minibatches, posing challenges in finding a favorable coupling strategy for straightening trajectories to few-step generation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, Straighter trajectories of Flow Matching (StraightFM). It straightens trajectories with the coupling strategy from the entire distribution level. More specifically, during training, StraightFM creates couplings of images and noise via one diffusion model as a coupling prior to straighten trajectories for few-step generation. Our coupling strategy can also integrate with the existing coupling direction from real data to noise, improving image quality in few-step generation. Experimental results on pixel space and latent space show that StraightFM yields attractive samples within 5 steps. Moreover, our unconditional StraightFM is seamlessly compatible with training-free multimodal conditional generation, maintaining high-quality image generation in few steps.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-Conditioning for Image Generation via Sketch-Text Pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22627v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material, texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its unprecedented level of design customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV25 (Oral).

Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image, often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets over 13 domains. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MEPG:Multi-Expert Planning and Generation for Compositionally-Rich Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04126v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hardware-Friendly Diffusion Models with Fixed-Size Reusable Structures for On-Device Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06119v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers and U-Net architectures have been widely adopted in the implementation of Diffusion Models. However, each architecture presents specific challenges while realizing them on-device. Vision Transformers require positional embedding to maintain correspondence between the tokens processed by the transformer, although they offer the advantage of using fixed-size, reusable repetitive blocks following tokenization. The U-Net architecture lacks these attributes, as it utilizes variable-sized intermediate blocks for down-convolution and up-convolution in the noise estimation backbone for the diffusion process. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that utilizes a fixed-size, reusable transformer block as a core structure, making it more suitable for hardware implementation. Our architecture is characterized by low complexity, token-free design, absence of positional embeddings, uniformity, and scalability, making it highly suitable for deployment on mobile and resource-constrained devices. The proposed model exhibit competitive and consistent performance across both unconditional and conditional image generation tasks. The model achieved a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.6 on unconditional image generation with the CelebA.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at IJCNN 2025 poster track</p></details> | None |

However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are designed for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit creative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be difficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in diverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and personalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool that (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image generative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space of generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize expansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains demonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity and help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks, thereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of possible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual creativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future text-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic values and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.</p></details> |  | None |

Considering the practical scenarios where the defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for deployment on edge devices in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop on Representation Learning with Very Limited Resources: When Data, Modalities, Labels, and Computing Resources are Scarce as an oral paper</p></details> | None |

Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Discrete Noise Inversion for Next-scale Autoregressive Text-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01984v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.</p></details> | update affiliation | None |

However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models. Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves StegaStamp by 18.743%.

To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel, unified, and highly generalizable framework that goes beyond traditional binary classification, providing detailed, textual reasoning for its predictions. Distinct from conventional methods, TruthLens performs MLLM grounding. TruthLens uses a task-driven representation integration strategy that unites global semantic context from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with region-specific forensic cues through explicit cross-modal adaptation of a vision-only model. This enables nuanced, region-grounded reasoning for both face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, and supports fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?"- capabilities beyond pretrained MLLMs alone. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens sets a new benchmark in both forensic interpretability and detection accuracy, generalizing to seen and unseen manipulations alike. By unifying high-level scene understanding with fine-grained region grounding, TruthLens delivers transparent DeepFake forensics, bridging a critical gap in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we observe that training velocity solely from the final layer output underutilizes the rich inter layer representations, potentially impeding model convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepFlow, a novel framework that enhances velocity representation through inter layer communication. DeepFlow partitions transformer layers into balanced branches with deep supervision and inserts a lightweight Velocity Refiner with Acceleration (VeRA) block between adjacent branches, which aligns the intermediate velocity features within transformer blocks. Powered by the improved deep supervision via the internal velocity alignment, DeepFlow converges 8 times faster on ImageNet with equivalent performance and further reduces FID by 2.6 while halving training time compared to previous flow based models without a classifier free guidance. DeepFlow also outperforms baselines in text to image generation tasks, as evidenced by evaluations on MSCOCO and zero shot GenEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Unlike the well-established pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids, neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency, and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications, facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions in 3D generation.

However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends. Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and expand their applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to 0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is at https://learn-to-steer-paper.github.io/</p></details> | None |

The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the size and variability of training data. However, the potential of diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion; including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at AVSS 2025 conference</p></details> | None |

Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$ between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in different settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these hallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for image generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with human aesthetic values.

While palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows, they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters: histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette adherence and high image quality.</p></details> | 14 pages, 19 figures | None |

| **[InfoScale: Unleashing Training-free Variable-scaled Image Generation via Effective Utilization of Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01421v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise. Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3) The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose \textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and achieve an effective balance between local and global information in higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3), we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

While fine-tuning large pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a 1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generality.

However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of controllable multi-subject image synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |

We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative (FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream auxiliary trainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 19 figures, ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Boosting Generative Image Modeling via Joint Image-Feature Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16064v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models (LDMs) dominate high-quality image generation, yet integrating representation learning with generative modeling remains a challenge. We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that seamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model low-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level semantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.

| **[Diffusion-Based Image-to-Brain Signal Generation with Cross-Attention Mechanisms for Visual Prostheses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing query-aware serving systems mitigate the cost by cascading lightweight and heavyweight models, but most rely on a fixed cascade configuration and route all prompts through an initial lightweight stage, wasting resources on complex queries. We present HADIS, a hybrid adaptive diffusion model serving system that jointly optimizes cascade model selection, query routing, and resource allocation. HADIS employs a rule-based prompt router to send clearly hard queries directly to heavyweight models, bypassing the overhead of the lightweight stage. To reduce the complexity of resource management, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal cascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade configuration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints. Empirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves response quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by 2.7-45$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, they also raise concerns about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy. This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization. The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025 Workshop on the Impact of Memorization on Trustworthy Foundation Models</p></details> | None |

However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too, are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96% yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes, our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.</p></details> |  | None |

Representative data augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods.

To further improve T2I models' capability in numerical and spatial reasoning, layout is employed as an intermedium to bridge large language models and layout-based diffusion models. However, these methods often rely on closed-source, large-scale LLMs for layout prediction, limiting accessibility and scalability. They also struggle with generating images from prompts with multiple objects and complicated spatial relationships. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach which decouples the generation task into multiple subtasks. First, the layout prediction stage is divided into numerical & spatial reasoning and bounding box visual planning, enabling even lightweight LLMs to achieve layout accuracy comparable to large-scale models. Second, the layout-to-image generation stage is divided into two steps to synthesize objects from easy ones to difficult ones. Experiments are conducted on the HRS and NSR-1K benchmarks and our method outperforms previous approaches with notable margins. In addition, visual results and user study demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the perceptual quality, especially when generating multiple objects from complex textural prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECAI 2025</p></details> | None |

These two aspects hinder the development of accurate machine learning models. While generative AI offers a promising solution, producing synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers remains challenging. This work addresses the classification of individual white blood cells, a critical task in diagnosing hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We introduce CytoDiff, a stable diffusion model fine-tuned with LoRA weights and guided by few-shot samples that generates high-fidelity synthetic white blood cell images. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in classifier performance when training data is limited. Using a small, highly imbalanced real dataset, the addition of 5,000 synthetic images per class improved ResNet classifier accuracy from 27\% to 78\% (+51\%). Similarly, CLIP-based classification accuracy increased from 62\% to 77\% (+15\%). These results establish synthetic image generation as a valuable tool for biomedical machine learning, enhancing data coverage and facilitating secure data sharing while preserving patient privacy.

However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on 5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to 21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives. We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across multiple evaluation dimensions.

This thesis develops frameworks that use counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems. The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution (LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts. The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular, training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals. Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias evaluation and mitigation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens when minimal score differences between images are amplified after normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM, and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences, providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally, existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27 sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/Pref-GRPO</p></details> | [Code Link](https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward) |

While X-ray imaging is a reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML) models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples. In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising results to optimize the defect localization process.</p></details> |  | None |

Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion. Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions, and is more scalable.

Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[When Memory Becomes a Vulnerability: Towards Multi-turn Jailbreak Attacks against Text-to-Image Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20376v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern text-to-image (T2I) generation systems (e.g., DALL$\cdot$E 3) exploit the memory mechanism, which captures key information in multi-turn interactions for faithful generation. Despite its practicality, the security analyses of this mechanism have fallen far behind. In this paper, we reveal that it can exacerbate the risk of jailbreak attacks. Previous attacks fuse the unsafe target prompt into one ultimate adversarial prompt, which can be easily detected or lead to the generation of non-unsafe images due to under- or over-detoxification. In contrast, we propose embedding the malice at the inception of the chat session in memory, addressing the above limitations. Specifically, we propose Inception, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack against real-world text-to-image generation systems that explicitly exploits their memory mechanisms. Inception is composed of two key modules: segmentation and recursion. We introduce Segmentation, a semantic-preserving method that generates multi-round prompts. By leveraging NLP analysis techniques, we design policies to decompose a prompt, together with its malicious intent, according to sentence structure, thereby evading safety filters. Recursion further addresses the challenge posed by unsafe sub-prompts that cannot be separated through simple segmentation. It firstly expands the sub-prompt, then invokes segmentation recursively. To facilitate multi-turn adversarial prompts crafting, we build VisionFlow, an emulation T2I system that integrates two-stage safety filters and industrial-grade memory mechanisms. The experiment results show that Inception successfully allures unsafe image generation, surpassing the SOTA by a 20.0\% margin in attack success rate. We also conduct experiments on the real-world commercial T2I generation platforms, further validating the threats of Inception in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work proposes a multi-turn jailbreak attack against real-world chat-based T2I generation systems that intergrate memory mechanism.

Can we automatically generate such images using basic product information like a product foreground image, taglines, and a target size? Existing methods mainly focus on parts of the problem and lack a comprehensive solution. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel product-centric framework for advertising image design called T-Stars-Poster. It consists of four sequential stages to highlight product foregrounds and taglines while achieving overall image aesthetics: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Different expert models are designed and trained for the first three stages: First, a visual language model (VLM) generates background prompts that match the products. Next, a VLM-based layout generation model arranges the placement of product foregrounds, graphic elements (taglines and decorative underlays), and various nongraphic elements (objects from the background prompt). Following this, an SDXL-based model can simultaneously accept prompts, layouts, and foreground controls to generate images. To support T-Stars-Poster, we create two corresponding datasets with over 50,000 labeled images. Extensive experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that T-Stars-Poster can produce more visually appealing advertising images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> | None |

This challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement, enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency. We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance. Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3, thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image. Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were entirely unseen during training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GS: Generative Segmentation via Label Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20020v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-driven image segmentation is a fundamental task in vision-language understanding, requiring models to segment regions of an image corresponding to natural language expressions. Traditional methods approach this as a discriminative problem, assigning each pixel to foreground or background based on semantic alignment. Recently, diffusion models have been introduced to this domain, but existing approaches remain image-centric: they either (i) use image diffusion models as visual feature extractors, (ii) synthesize segmentation data via image generation to train discriminative models, or (iii) perform diffusion inversion to extract attention cues from pre-trained image diffusion models-thereby treating segmentation as an auxiliary process. In this paper, we propose GS (Generative Segmentation), a novel framework that formulates segmentation itself as a generative task via label diffusion. Instead of generating images conditioned on label maps and text, GS reverses the generative process: it directly generates segmentation masks from noise, conditioned on both the input image and the accompanying language description. This paradigm makes label generation the primary modeling target, enabling end-to-end training with explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate GS on Panoptic Narrative Grounding (PNG), a representative and challenging benchmark for multimodal segmentation that requires panoptic-level reasoning guided by narrative captions. Experimental results show that GS significantly outperforms existing discriminative and diffusion-based methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

While this approach also controls the distance between the posterior measures in the case of the Kullback--Leibler divergence, this is in general not hold true for the Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we introduce a conditional Wasserstein distance via a set of restricted couplings that equals the expected Wasserstein distance of the posteriors. Interestingly, the dual formulation of the conditional Wasserstein-1 flow resembles losses in the conditional Wasserstein GAN literature in a quite natural way. We derive theoretical properties of the conditional Wasserstein distance, characterize the corresponding geodesics and velocity fields as well as the flow ODEs. Subsequently, we propose to approximate the velocity fields by relaxing the conditional Wasserstein distance. Based on this, we propose an extension of OT Flow Matching for solving Bayesian inverse problems and demonstrate its numerical advantages on an inverse problem and class-conditional image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper supersedes arXiv:2310.13433, accepted at JMLR</p></details> | None |

By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/SunzeY/X-Prompt</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SunzeY/X-Prompt) |

However, contemporary methods face challenges in capturing the precise semantics conveyed by complex multi-object prompts. Consequently, many works have sought to mitigate such semantic misalignments, typically via inference-time schemes that modify the attention layers of the denoising networks. However, prior work has mostly utilized coarse metrics, such as the cosine similarity between text and image CLIP embeddings, or human evaluations, which are challenging to conduct on a larger-scale. In this work, we perform a case study on colors -- a fundamental attribute commonly associated with objects in text prompts, which offer a rich test bed for rigorous evaluation. Our analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle to generate images that faithfully reflect multiple color attributes-far more so than with single-color prompts-and that neither inference-time techniques nor existing editing methods reliably resolve these semantic misalignments. Accordingly, we introduce a dedicated image editing technique, mitigating the issue of multi-object semantic alignment for prompts containing multiple colors. We demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts performance over a wide range of metrics, considering images generated by various text-to-image diffusion-based techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://tau-vailab.github.io/color-edit/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://tau-vailab.github.io/color-edit) |

By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Extensive experiments on our tailored metrics for CHOI task demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast to its predecessor, MonoRelief V1 [1], which was solely trained on synthetic data, MonoRelief V2 incorporates real data to achieve improved robustness, accuracy and efficiency. To overcome the challenge of acquiring large-scale real-world dataset, we generate approximately 15,000 pseudo real images using a text-to-image generative model, and derive corresponding depth pseudo-labels through fusion of depth and normal predictions. Furthermore, we construct a small-scale real-world dataset (800 samples) via multi-view reconstruction and detail refinement. MonoRelief V2 is then progressively trained on the pseudo-real and real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance both in depth and normal predictions, highlighting its strong potential for a range of downstream applications.

However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration.

Despite advances in vision and language models, this task remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model, allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh. Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing approaches.

To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the equally-weighted approach.

However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning.

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner.

To address these limitations, existing works have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities. However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance (Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%, 5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed Visual-CoG.

To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves image quality.

Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.</p></details> | 17 figures | None |
| **[Conditional Stochastic Interpolation for Generative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05579v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a conditional stochastic interpolation (CSI) method for learning conditional distributions. CSI is based on estimating probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations that transport a reference distribution to the target conditional distribution. This is achieved by first learning the conditional drift and score functions based on CSI, which are then used to construct a deterministic process governed by an ordinary differential equation or a diffusion process for conditional sampling. In our proposed approach, we incorporate an adaptive diffusion term to address the instability issues arising in the diffusion process. We derive explicit expressions of the conditional drift and score functions in terms of conditional expectations, which naturally lead to an nonparametric regression approach to estimating these functions. Furthermore, we establish nonasymptotic error bounds for learning the target conditional distribution. We illustrate the application of CSI on image generation using a benchmark image dataset.</p></details> | 60 pages, 4 figures | None |

Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification, showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation, particularly in low-data regimes.

While prior methods have introduced adversarial perturbations to prevent style imitation, most are accompanied by the degradation of artworks' visual quality. Recognizing the importance of maintaining this, we introduce a visually improved protection method while preserving its protection capability. To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off'' model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.</p></details> |  | None |

We use a comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities, reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 2024 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society; code available at https://github.com/kyrawilson/Image-Generation-Bias</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/kyrawilson/Image-Generation-Bias) |
| **[Condition Weaving Meets Expert Modulation: Towards Universal and Controllable Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17364v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness.

| **[DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17356v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\bf{3 \space billion}$ parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

While post-training alignment has proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation, its application to generative speech restoration remains largely under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency, and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models (MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce scenarios like singing voice restoration.

Because no existing datasets are available for this task, we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which consider captions and images separately.

In this paper, we show that multi-modal embeddings can be vulnerable to an attack we call "adversarial illusions." Given an image or a sound, an adversary can perturb it to make its embedding close to an arbitrary, adversary-chosen input in another modality. These attacks are cross-modal and targeted: the adversary can align any image or sound with any target of his choice. Adversarial illusions exploit proximity in the embedding space and are thus agnostic to downstream tasks and modalities, enabling a wholesale compromise of current and future tasks, as well as modalities not available to the adversary. Using ImageBind and AudioCLIP embeddings, we demonstrate how adversarially aligned inputs, generated without knowledge of specific downstream tasks, mislead image generation, text generation, zero-shot classification, and audio retrieval. We investigate transferability of illusions across different embeddings and develop a black-box version of our method that we use to demonstrate the first adversarial alignment attack on Amazon's commercial, proprietary Titan embedding. Finally, we analyze countermeasures and evasion attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In US...</summary><p>In USENIX Security'24</p></details> | None |

| **[Watermarking Visual Concepts for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11688v3)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating images with specific concepts. This ability also poses great threats to copyright protection and network security since malicious users can generate unauthorized content and disinformation relevant to a target concept. Model watermarking is an effective solution to trace the malicious generated images and safeguard their copyright. However, existing model watermarking techniques merely achieve image-level tracing without concept traceability. When tracing infringing or harmful concepts, current approaches execute image concept detection and model tracing sequentially, where performance is critically constrained by concept detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight concept watermarking framework that efficiently binds target concepts to model watermarks, supporting simultaneous concept identification and model tracing via single-stage watermark verification. To further enhance the robustness of concept watermarking, we propose an adversarial perturbation injection method collaboratively embedded with watermarks during image generation, avoiding watermark removal by model purification attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptWM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art watermarking methods, improving detection accuracy by 6.3%-19.3% across diverse datasets including COCO and StableDiffusionDB. Additionally, ConceptWM possesses a critical capability absent in other watermarking methods: it sustains a 21.7% FID/CLIP degradation under adversarial fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion models on WikiArt and CelebA-HQ, demonstrating its capability to mitigate model misuse.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances in image generation have enabled high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations, we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose, expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead. Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion, while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages(excluding references), 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing training-free acceleration methods typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed, restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency. Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models, underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures | None |

Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc, human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation, respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find better hyperparameters.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features: (1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more efficient.

| **[CineScale: Free Lunch in High-Resolution Cinematic Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15774v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated video samples are available at our website: https://eyeline-labs.github.io/CineScale/.</p></details> | <details><summary>CineS...</summary><p>CineScale is an extended work of FreeScale (ICCV 2025).

| **[Fast-DDPM: Fast Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Medical Image-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14802v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved unprecedented success in computer vision. However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures to optimize time-step utilization. Specifically, we introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling. We evaluated Fast-DDPM across three medical image-to-image generation tasks: multi-image super-resolution, image denoising, and image-to-image translation. Fast-DDPM outperformed DDPM and current state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks in all tasks. Additionally, Fast-DDPM reduced the training time to 0.2x and the sampling time to 0.01x compared to DDPM.

| **[Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15594v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial, potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes clinically viable.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Routing of Text-to-Image Generation Requests Between Large Cloud Model and Light-Weight Edge Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13787v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large text-to-image models demonstrate impressive generation capabilities; however, their substantial size necessitates expensive cloud servers for deployment. Conversely, light-weight models can be deployed on edge devices at lower cost but often with inferior generation quality for complex user prompts. To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called RouteT2I, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, RouteT2I allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud. Evaluation reveals that RouteT2I significantly reduces the number of requesting large cloud model while maintaining high-quality image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Designers have increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting. However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1) the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction (all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '25)</p></details> | None |

Sorted: Agentic System for Compositional Diagram Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15222v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools.

However, capturing such images is expensive and requires specialized equipment, making ODI synthesis increasingly important. While common 2D image generation and editing methods are rapidly advancing, these models struggle to deliver satisfactory results when generating or editing ODIs due to the unique format and broad 360$^{\circ}$ Field-of-View (FoV) of ODIs. To bridge this gap, we construct \textbf{\textit{Any2Omni}}, the first comprehensive ODI generation-editing dataset comprises 60,000+ training data covering diverse input conditions and up to 9 ODI generation and editing tasks. Built upon Any2Omni, we propose an \textbf{\underline{Omni}} model for \textbf{\underline{Omni}}-directional image generation and editing (\textbf{\textit{Omni$^2$}}), with the capability of handling various ODI generation and editing tasks under diverse input conditions using one model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed Omni$^2$ model for both the ODI generation and editing tasks.

| **[CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017 demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality.

Diffusion models, though capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source, TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW-CV4BIOM 2025</p></details> | None |

Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MAPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Dynamic watermarks in images generated by diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08927v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but their widespread use raises significant ethical concerns, including intellectual property protection and the misuse of synthetic media. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.</p></details> |  | None |

In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

An adaptation method fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets. Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities. Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the increasing resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges. Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and resolution-aware.

This is in contrast to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), which have some limitations in terms of image quality.We introduce the diffusion model to the precipitation forecasting task and propose a short-term precipitation nowcasting with condition diffusion model based on historical observational data, which is referred to as SRNDiff. By incorporating an additional conditional decoder module in the denoising process, SRNDiff achieves end-to-end conditional rainfall prediction. SRNDiff is composed of two networks: a denoising network and a conditional Encoder network. The conditional network is composed of multiple independent UNet networks. These networks extract conditional feature maps at different resolutions, providing accurate conditional information that guides the diffusion model for conditional generation.SRNDiff surpasses GANs in terms of prediction accuracy, although it requires more computational resources.The SRNDiff model exhibits higher stability and efficiency during training than GANs-based approaches, and generates high-quality precipitation distribution samples that better reflect future actual precipitation conditions. This fully validates the advantages and potential of diffusion models in precipitation forecasting, providing new insights for enhancing rainfall prediction.</p></details> |  | None |

DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect 1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age. We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based text-to-image generative models.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present a systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).

Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures.

Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce \textit{two new} jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 95\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  | None |

However, the quality of generated samples is highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap. Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[2D Gaussians Meet Visual Tokenizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13515v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially outperforming existing methods.

In CVTG, image generation models often rendering distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings. We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ID-Card Synthetic Generation: Toward a Simulated Bona fide Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13078v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, the development of a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) system for ID cards presents a challenge due to the lack of images available to train a robust PAD system and the increase in diversity of possible attack instrument species. Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and data restrictions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CCDM: Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03546v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables (aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task.

| **[Hyperspectral Image Generation with Unmixing Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02601v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention, but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an advancement in hyperspectral data generation.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked, and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks.

| **[PixelPonder: Dynamic Patch Adaptation for Enhanced Multi-Conditional Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06684v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image generation have demonstrated promising results through visual condition control. However, existing ControlNet-like methods struggle with compositional visual conditioning - simultaneously preserving semantic fidelity across multiple heterogeneous control signals while maintaining high visual quality, where they employ separate control branches that often introduce conflicting guidance during the denoising process, leading to structural distortions and artifacts in generated images. To address this issue, we present PixelPonder, a novel unified control framework, which allows for effective control of multiple visual conditions under a single control structure. Specifically, we design a patch-level adaptive condition selection mechanism that dynamically prioritizes spatially relevant control signals at the sub-region level, enabling precise local guidance without global interference. Additionally, a time-aware control injection scheme is deployed to modulate condition influence according to denoising timesteps, progressively transitioning from structural preservation to texture refinement and fully utilizing the control information from different categories to promote more harmonious image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PixelPonder surpasses previous methods across different benchmark datasets, showing superior improvement in spatial alignment accuracy while maintaining high textual semantic consistency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Next Visual Granularity Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12811v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30 -> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Single-Reference Text-to-Image Manipulation with Dual Contrastive Denoising Score](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12718v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions. To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models without further training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stable Diffusion-Based Approach for Human De-Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12663v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task. De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions. The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as 2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | MM 2025 | None |

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

| **[Local Prompt Adaptation for Style-Consistent Multi-Object Generation in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20094v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image generation, producing high-quality visuals from natural language prompts. However, when prompts involve multiple objects alongside global or local style instructions, the outputs often drift in style and lose spatial coherence, limiting their reliability for controlled, style-consistent scene generation. We present Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA), a lightweight, training-free method that splits the prompt into content and style tokens, then injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at chosen timesteps. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the denoising process, LPA improves both layout control and stylistic uniformity without additional training cost. We conduct extensive ablations across parser settings and injection windows, finding that the best configuration -- lpa late only with a 300-650 step window -- delivers the strongest balance of prompt alignment and style consistency. On the T2I benchmark, LPA improves CLIP-prompt alignment over vanilla SDXL by +0.41% and over SD1.5 by +0.34%, with no diversity loss. On our custom 50-prompt style-rich benchmark, LPA achieves +0.09% CLIP-prompt and +0.08% CLIP-style gains over baseline. Our method is model-agnostic, easy to integrate, and requires only a single configuration change, making it a practical choice for controllable, style-consistent multi-object generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages,10 figures, pre-print</p></details> | None |

In this work, we design a modular, edge-assisted architecture that supports both direct text-to-3D and text-image-to-3D pathways, enabling interchangeable integration of state-of-the-art components and systematic comparison of their performance in AR settings. Using this architecture, we implement and evaluate four representative pipelines through an IRB-approved user study with 11 participants, assessing six perceptual and usability metrics across three object prompts. Overall, text-image-to-3D pipelines deliver higher generation quality: the best-performing pipeline, which used FLUX for image generation and Trellis for 3D generation, achieved an average satisfaction score of 4.55 out of 5 and an intent alignment score of 4.82 out of 5. In contrast, direct text-to-3D pipelines excel in speed, with the fastest, Shap-E, completing generation in about 20 seconds. Our results suggest that perceptual quality has a greater impact on user satisfaction than latency, with users tolerating longer generation times when output quality aligns with expectations. We complement subjective ratings with system-level metrics and visual analysis, providing practical insights into the trade-offs of current 3D generation methods for real-world AR deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISMAR 2025 UNAI Workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[DeCoT: Decomposing Complex Instructions for Enhanced Text-to-Image Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12396v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable advancements, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models struggle with complex, long-form textual instructions, frequently failing to accurately render intricate details, spatial relationships, or specific constraints. This limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models' understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement, where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and "Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators (Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and accurate image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, evaluating the performance of image generation models remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we propose ICE-Bench, a unified and comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously assess image generation models. Its comprehensiveness could be summarized in the following key features: (1) Coarse-to-Fine Tasks: We systematically deconstruct image generation into four task categories: No-ref/Ref Image Creating/Editing, based on the presence or absence of source images and reference images. And further decompose them into 31 fine-grained tasks covering a broad spectrum of image generation requirements, culminating in a comprehensive benchmark. (2) Multi-dimensional Metrics: The evaluation framework assesses image generation capabilities across 6 dimensions: aesthetic quality, imaging quality, prompt following, source consistency, reference consistency, and controllability. 11 metrics are introduced to support the multi-dimensional evaluation. Notably, we introduce VLLM-QA, an innovative metric designed to assess the success of image editing by leveraging large models. (3) Hybrid Data: The data comes from real scenes and virtual generation, which effectively improves data diversity and alleviates the bias problem in model evaluation. Through ICE-Bench, we conduct a thorough analysis of existing generation models, revealing both the challenging nature of our benchmark and the gap between current model capabilities and real-world generation requirements. To foster further advancements in the field, we will open-source ICE-Bench, including its dataset, evaluation code, and models, thereby providing a valuable resource for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods.

However, traditional workflows face challenges in communication due to the differing backgrounds of illustrators and designers, the latter with limited artistic abilities. To overcome these challenges, we created Sketchar, a Generative AI (GenAI) tool that allows designers to prototype game characters and generate images based on conceptual input, providing visual outcomes that can give immediate feedback and enhance communication with illustrators' next step in the design cycle. We conducted a mixed-method study to evaluate the interaction between game designers and Sketchar. We showed that the reference images generated in co-creating with Sketchar fostered refinement of design details and can be incorporated into real-world workflows. Moreover, designers without artistic backgrounds found the Sketchar workflow to be more expressive and worthwhile. This research demonstrates the potential of GenAI in enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration in the game industry, enabling designers to interact beyond their own limited expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI PLAY 2024</p></details> | None |

Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data.

Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</p></details> |  | None |

A growing body of works have emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However, these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement (CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1) grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> |  | None |

Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability.

| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structured Generative Modeling with the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14167v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model offers an expressive and interpretable framework for text and image generation. However, it remains unclear how this interpretability can be used to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) to take advantage of structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, T-KAM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low dimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we demonstrate that importance sampling becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly efficient training strategy. We also introduce a training criterion using population-based LMC, which decomposes posterior sampling into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve multimodal exploration. T-KAM elegantly balances common trade-offs in generative modeling, offering fast inference, high sample quality, and stable training, while being naturally suited to upcoming Zettascale Computing Co. hardware and extendable to other high-impact research directions in generative intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite these technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these models' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal biases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is included in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes in the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel framework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social biases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an LLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in generated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module that fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate identified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and datasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining high-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and quantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space, building upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our results show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the diversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate, using the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are challenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond occupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PiT: Progressive Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13219v5)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within image generation via the transformer architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global modeling transformers, which face significant quadratic computational cost. However, through empirical analysis, we find that DiTs do not rely as heavily on global information as previously believed. In fact, most layers exhibit significant redundancy in global computation. Additionally, conventional attention mechanisms suffer from low-frequency inertia, limiting their efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Pseudo Shifted Window Attention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global attention redundancy. PSWA achieves moderate global-local information through window attention. It further utilizes a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, which both enrich the high-frequency information and strengthen inter-window connections. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation (PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention without additional computational cost. Based on these innovations, we propose a series of Pseudo Progressive Diffusion Transformer (PiT). Our extensive experiments show their superior performance; for example, our proposed PiT-L achieves 54% FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while using less computation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PromptSafe: Gated Prompt Tuning for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01272v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality, but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%), while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

The approach enables controllable synthesis and the creation of rare or out-of-distribution scenes beyond the training set. Rather than training a task-specific small model from scratch, we adapt an open-source text-to-image foundation model to the SAR modality, using its semantic prior to align prompts with SAR imaging physics (side-looking geometry, slant-range projection, and coherent speckle with heavy-tailed statistics). Using a 100k-image SAR dataset, we compare full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across the UNet diffusion backbone, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and the text encoders. Evaluation combines (i) statistical distances to real SAR amplitude distributions, (ii) textural similarity via Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) descriptors, and (iii) semantic alignment using a SAR-specialized CLIP model. Our results show that a hybrid strategy-full UNet tuning with LoRA on the text encoders and a learned token embedding-best preserves SAR geometry and texture while maintaining prompt fidelity. The framework supports text-based control and multimodal conditioning (e.g., segmentation maps, TerraSAR-X, or optical guidance), opening new paths for large-scale SAR scene data augmentation and unseen scenario simulation in Earth observation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object Fidelity Diffusion for Remote Sensing Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10801v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase. Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploiting Discriminative Codebook Prior for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10719v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook, which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance. Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS performance.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI | None |

However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts.

Yet, recent progress in generation quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2 exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%, respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\% reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling time.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with 9$\boldsymbol\times$ fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset. First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed method.

However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically, rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style (low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality and achieving improved controllability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30 of the computational resources and 20 GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Spatially Consistent Image Generation: On Incorporating Intrinsic Scene Properties into Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10382v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).</p></details> |  | None |

A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling. This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO) framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
