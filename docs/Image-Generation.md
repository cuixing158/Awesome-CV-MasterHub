| **[LARM: A Large Articulated-Object Reconstruction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11563v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site) |
| **[Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE) |
| **[CVChess: A Deep Learning Framework for Converting Chessboard Images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11522v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PAS : Prelim Attention Score for Detecting Object Hallucinations in Large Vision--Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11502v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data-efficient U-Net for Segmentation of Carbide Microstructures in SEM Images of Steel Alloys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11485v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ImAgent: A Unified Multimodal Agent Framework for Test-Time Scalable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11483v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 6 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Inferring response times of perceptual decisions with Poisson variational autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11480v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Data on the Mind and Brain</p></details> | None |
| **[Symmetrical Flow Matching: Unified Image Generation, Segmentation, and Classification with Score-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10634v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |
| **[Towards Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection via Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01603v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In AI-generated image detection, current cutting-edge methods typically adapt pre-trained foundation models through partial-parameter fine-tuning. However, these approaches often struggle to generalize to forgeries from unseen generators, as the fine-tuned models capture only limited patterns from training data and fail to reflect the evolving traits of new ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), a novel paradigm that dynamically adjusts the prompts fed into the encoder according to each testing image, rather than fixing them after training. This design significantly enhances robustness and adaptability to diverse forged images. The dynamic prompts integrate conditional information with test-time adaptive tokens through a lightweight learnable scaling factor. The conditional information is produced by a Conditional Information Learner, which leverages CNN-based feature extractors to model both forgery-specific and general conditions. The test-time adaptive tokens are optimized during inference on a single sample by enforcing prediction consistency across multiple views, ensuring that the parameters align with the current image. For the final decision, the optimal input with the highest prediction confidence is selected. Extensive experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mean accuracies of 95.61% and 96.7% on the widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage datasets, respectively. Codes and weights will be released on https://github.com/liyih/IAPL.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, codes: https://github.com/liyih/IAPL</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/liyih/IAPL) |
| **[Rethinking Efficient Mixture-of-Experts for Remote Sensing Modality-Missing Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11460v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[SimTac: A Physics-Based Simulator for Vision-Based Tactile Sensing with Biomorphic Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11456v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing in biological organisms is deeply intertwined with morphological form, such as human fingers, cat paws, and elephant trunks, which enables rich and adaptive interactions through a variety of geometrically complex structures. In contrast, vision-based tactile sensors in robotics have been limited to simple planar geometries, with biomorphic designs remaining underexplored. To address this gap, we present SimTac, a physics-based simulation framework for the design and validation of biomorphic tactile sensors. SimTac consists of particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network for predicting mechanical responses, enabling accurate and efficient simulation across a wide range of geometries and materials. We demonstrate the versatility of SimTac by designing and validating physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and further demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks, including object classification, slip detection, and contact safety assessment. Our framework bridges the gap between bio-inspired design and practical realisation, expanding the design space of tactile sensors and paving the way for tactile sensing systems that integrate morphology and sensing to enable robust interaction in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VoxTell: Free-Text Promptable Universal 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11450v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VoxTell, a vision-language model for text-prompted volumetric medical image segmentation. It maps free-form descriptions, from single words to full clinical sentences, to 3D masks. Trained on 62K+ CT, MRI, and PET volumes spanning over 1K anatomical and pathological classes, VoxTell uses multi-stage vision-language fusion across decoder layers to align textual and visual features at multiple scales. It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across modalities on unseen datasets, excelling on familiar concepts while generalizing to related unseen classes. Extensive experiments further demonstrate strong cross-modality transfer, robustness to linguistic variations and clinical language, as well as accurate instance-specific segmentation from real-world text.

| **[The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11435v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WEAVE: Unleashing and Benchmarking the In-context Interleaved Comprehension and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11434v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.</p></details> |  | None |

Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems. The dataset and model are available at $\href{https://multilingual.franreno.com}{multilingual.franreno.com}$.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages,12 figures,published to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[MicroVQA++: High-Quality Microscopy Reasoning Dataset with Weakly Supervised Graphs for Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11407v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Adaptive Cache Enhancement for Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07570v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks, particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, Under review</p></details> | None |

The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of hand-tuned force field parameters by employing a deep neural network trained to infer optimal planner gains from a single depth image of the scene. The pipeline incorporates a CUDA-accelerated perception module, a predictive agent-based planning strategy, and a dataset generated through Bayesian optimization in simulation. The resulting framework enables real-time planning without manual parameter tuning and is validated both in simulation and on a Franka Emika Panda robot. Experimental results demonstrate successful task completion and improved generalization compared to classical planners.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the Löwner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy with Vision-Language Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10769v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of regions of interest in biomedical images holds substantial value in image analysis. Although several foundation models for biomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on certain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen domain data. We owe the deficiency to lack of vision-language knowledge before segmentation. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us to leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling vision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on cross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that seamlessly uses MLLMs to guide SAM in learning microscopy cross-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy, named uLLSAM. Specifically, we propose the Vision-Language Semantic Alignment (VLSA) module, which injects VLK into Segment Anything Model (SAM). We find that after SAM receives global VLK prompts, its performance improves significantly, but there are deficiencies in boundary contour perception. Therefore, we further propose Semantic Boundary Regularization (SBR) to regularize SAM. Our method achieves performance improvements of 11.8% in SA across 9 in-domain microscopy datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our method also demonstrates improvements of 9.2% in SA across 10 out-of-domain datasets, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

In this work, we investigate how contextual cues combined with visual scene and facial information can be effectively utilized to predict and interpret social gaze patterns during conversational interactions. We introduce CSGaze, a context aware multimodal approach that leverages facial, scene information as complementary inputs to enhance social gaze pattern prediction from multi-person images. The model also incorporates a fine-grained attention mechanism centered on the principal speaker, which helps in better modeling social gaze dynamics. Experimental results show that CSGaze performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods on GP-Static, UCO-LAEO and AVA-LAEO. Our findings highlight the role of contextual cues in improving social gaze prediction. Additionally, we provide initial explainability through generated attention scores, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. We also demonstrate our model's generalizability by testing our model on open set datasets that demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, the lack of a reasonable benchmark dataset has led to inconsistent experimental settings across existing detection methods. To address these issues, we propose GreatSplicing, a manually created, large-scale, high-quality splicing dataset. GreatSplicing comprises 5,000 spliced images and covers spliced regions across 335 distinct semantic categories, enabling detection models to learn splicing traces more effectively. Empirical results show that detection models trained on GreatSplicing achieve low misidentification rates and stronger cross-dataset generalization compared to existing datasets.

For example, the Sigmoid activation is the de-facto activation in balanced classification tasks, however, in imbalanced classification, it proves inappropriate due to bias towards frequent classes. In this work, we delve deeper in this phenomenon by performing a comprehensive statistical analysis in the classification and intermediate layers of both balanced and imbalanced networks and we empirically show that aligning the activation function with the data distribution, enhances the performance in both balanced and imbalanced tasks. To this end, we propose the Adaptive Parametric Activation (APA) function, a novel and versatile activation function that unifies most common activation functions under a single formula. APA can be applied in both intermediate layers and attention layers, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art on several imbalanced benchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist2018, Places-LT, CIFAR100-LT and LVIS. Also, we extend APA to a plethora of other tasks such as classification, detection, visual instruction following tasks, image generation and next-text-token prediction benchmarks. APA increases the performance in multiple benchmarks across various model architectures.

| **[Enhancing Video Inpainting with Aligned Frame Interval Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21461v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image-to-video (I2V) based video inpainting methods have made significant strides by leveraging single-image priors and modeling temporal consistency across masked frames. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from severe content degradation within video chunks. Furthermore, the absence of a robust frame alignment scheme compromises intra-chunk and inter-chunk spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the entire video. To address these limitations, we propose VidPivot, a novel framework that decouples video inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation. Our approach introduces frame interval priors as spatiotemporal cues to guide the inpainting process. To enhance cross-frame coherence, we design a FrameProp Module that implements a frame content propagation strategy, diffusing reference frame content into subsequent frames via a splicing mechanism. Additionally, a dedicated context controller encodes these coherent frame priors into the I2V generative backbone, effectively serving as soft constrain to suppress content distortion during generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidPivot achieves competitive performance across diverse benchmarks and generalizes well to different video inpainting scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

Designing a model general enough to be employed for all kinds of novel objects without (re-) training has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we present a new training-free framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). NOCTIS integrates two pre-trained models: Grounded-SAM 2 for object proposals with precise bounding boxes and corresponding segmentation masks; and DINOv2 for robust class and patch embeddings, due to its zero-shot capabilities. Internally, the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings with a new cyclic thresholding (CT) mechanism that mitigates unstable matches caused by repetitive textures or visually similar patterns. Beyond CT, NOCTIS introduces: (i) an appearance score that is unaffected by object selection bias; (ii) the usage of the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and mask as a scoring component; and (iii) an RGB-only pipeline that performs even better than RGB-D ones. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods regarding the mean AP score on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, CVPR 2026 preprint</p></details> | None |

Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CountSteer: Steering Attention for Object Counting in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11253v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Workshop on Shaping Responsible Synthetic Data in the Era of Foundation Models (RSD)</p></details> | None |

Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Parameter-Efficient MoE LoRA for Few-Shot Multi-Style Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11236v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Gaussian and Diffusion-Based Gaze Redirection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11231v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.</p></details> |  | None |

These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup. Furthermore, this controllability enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task we propose that requires fine-grained attribute discrimination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/weikaih04/Synthetic-Detection-Segmentation-Grounding-Data</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/weikaih04/Synthetic-Detection-Segmentation-Grounding-Data) |

While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to AAAI 2026 main track</p></details> | None |

However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Existing I2V methods concatenate the full information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance. We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.

Based on this encoding method, we implement a convolutional neural network for handwritten image classification over encryption. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to perform homomorphic multiplication, the main idea behind it, in a simple version, is to encrypt matrix $A$ and the transpose of matrix $B$ into two ciphertexts respectively. With additional operations, the homomorphic matrix multiplication can be calculated over encrypted matrices efficiently. For the convolution operation, we in advance span each convolution kernel to a matrix space of the same size as the input image so as to generate several ciphertexts, each of which is later used together with the ciphertext encrypting input images for calculating some of the final convolution results. We accumulate all these intermediate results and thus complete the convolution operation. In a public cloud with 40 vCPUs, our convolutional neural network implementation on the MNIST testing dataset takes $\sim$ 287 seconds to compute ten likelihoods of 32 encrypted images of size $28 \times 28$ simultaneously.

The efficiency of AfterLearnER is demonstrated by tackling non-differentiable signals such as threshold-based criteria in depth sensing, the word error rate in speech re-synthesis, the number of kills per life at Doom, computational accuracy or BLEU in code translation, image quality in 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs), and user feedback in image generation via Latent Diffusion Models (LDM). This retrofitting can be done after training, or dynamically at inference time by taking into account the user feedback. The advantages of AfterLearnER are its versatility, the possibility to use non-differentiable feedback, including human evaluations (i.e., no gradient is needed), the limited overfitting supported by a theoretical study, and its anytime behavior. Last but not least, AfterLearnER requires only a small amount of feedback, i.e., a few dozen to a few hundred scalars, compared to the tens of thousands needed in most related published works.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OT-ALD: Aligning Latent Distributions with Optimal Transport for Accelerated Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11162v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles, specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Different from prior works that require complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM's hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, <HYBNEXT>. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training T2I LLMs from scratch, ARRA reduces FID by 16.6% (ImageNet), 12.0% (LAION-COCO) for autoregressive LLMs like LlamaGen, without modifying original architecture and inference mechanism. For training from text-generation-only LLMs, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet) for advanced LLMs like Chameleon. For domain adaptation, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). These results demonstrate that training objective redesign, rather than architectural modifications, can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges.

A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning.

| **[Medverse: A Universal Model for Full-Resolution 3D Medical Image Segmentation, Transformation and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09232v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities. Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse) |

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 7th International Conference on Trends in Computational and Cognitive Engineering(TCCE-2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[MILD: Multi-Layer Diffusion Strategy for Complex and Precise Multi-IP Aware Human Erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06543v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in image customization tasks. However, existing mask-guided human erasing methods still struggle in complex scenarios such as human-human occlusion, human-object entanglement, and human-background interference, mainly due to the lack of large-scale multi-instance datasets and effective spatial decoupling to separate foreground from background. To bridge these gaps, we curate the MILD dataset capturing diverse poses, occlusions, and complex multi-instance interactions. We then define the Cross-Domain Attention Gap (CAG), an attention-gap metric to quantify semantic leakage. On top of these, we propose Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD), which decomposes the generation process into independent denoising pathways, enabling separate reconstruction of each foreground instance and the background. To enhance human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance, a plug-and-play module that incorporates pose, parsing, and spatial relationships into the diffusion process to improve structural awareness and restoration quality. Additionally, we present Spatially-Modulated Attention, an adaptive mechanism that leverages spatial mask priors to modulate attention across semantic regions, further widening the CAG to effectively minimize boundary artifacts and mitigate semantic leakage. Experiments show that MILD significantly outperforms existing methods. Datasets and code are publicly available at: https://mild-multi-layer-diffusion.github.io/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://mild-multi-layer-diffusion.github.io/) |

However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 19 tables</p></details> | None |

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI.

As networks evolve towards Sixth Generation (6G) and semantic communication becomes increasingly central to next-generation wireless systems, securing semantic information transmission emerges as a critical challenge. While classical physical layer security (PLS) focuses on passive security, the recently proposed concept of physical layer deception (PLD) offers a semantic encryption measure to actively deceive eavesdroppers. Yet the existing studies of PLD have been dominantly information-theoretical and link-level oriented, lacking considerations of system-level design and practical implementation. In this work we propose Visual ENcryption for Eavesdropping NegAtion (VENENA), an artificial intelligence-enabled framework for secure image-based communication. VENENA protects confidential messages by encoding them visually while actively deceiving eavesdroppers: legitimate receivers use artificial intelligence (AI)-based classifiers to extract true message semantics, while interceptors perceive only falsified content. The framework transmits two superimposed image components with different power levels - a high-power decoy image and a low-power correction mask - ensuring only authorized receivers with favorable channel conditions can reconstruct the true message. Experimental validation demonstrates over 93% accuracy for legitimate users while limiting eavesdropper success to 52% even when system design is fully known, validating VENENA's active defense capability for 6G semantic communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE OJ-COMS</p></details> | None |

Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.</p></details> |  | None |

This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas.

However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology.

Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent occupancy estimation techniques using only camera images as input can provide dense occupancy representations of large-scale scenes based on the current observation. However, they are mostly limited to representing the current 3D space and do not consider the future state of surrounding objects along the time axis. To extend camera-only occupancy estimation into spatiotemporal prediction, we propose Cam4DOcc, a new benchmark for camera-only 4D occupancy forecasting, evaluating the surrounding scene changes in a near future. We build our benchmark based on multiple publicly available datasets, including nuScenes, nuScenes-Occupancy, and Lyft-Level5, which provides sequential occupancy states of general movable and static objects, as well as their 3D backward centripetal flow. To establish this benchmark for future research with comprehensive comparisons, we introduce four baseline types from diverse camera-based perception and prediction implementations, including a static-world occupancy model, voxelization of point cloud prediction, 2D-3D instance-based prediction, and our proposed novel end-to-end 4D occupancy forecasting network. Furthermore, the standardized evaluation protocol for preset multiple tasks is also provided to compare the performance of all the proposed baselines on present and future occupancy estimation with respect to objects of interest in autonomous driving scenarios.

To achieve this, some recent works have been proposed to simultaneously forecast hand trajectories and object affordances on human egocentric videos. The joint prediction serves as a comprehensive representation of future hand-object interactions in 2D space, indicating potential human motion and motivation. However, the existing approaches mostly adopt the autoregressive paradigm for unidirectional prediction, which lacks mutual constraints within the holistic future sequence, and accumulates errors along the time axis. Meanwhile, these works basically overlook the effect of camera egomotion on first-person view predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based interaction prediction method, namely Diff-IP2D, to forecast future hand trajectories and object affordances concurrently in an iterative non-autoregressive manner. We transform the sequential 2D images into latent feature space and design a denoising diffusion model to predict future latent interaction features conditioned on past ones. Motion features are further integrated into the conditional denoising process to enable Diff-IP2D aware of the camera wearer's dynamics for more accurate interaction prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both the off-the-shelf metrics and our newly proposed evaluation protocol. This highlights the efficacy of leveraging a generative paradigm for 2D hand-object interaction prediction.

Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments.

While vision-centric methods suffer from geometric inaccuracies, LiDAR-based approaches often lack rich semantic information. To address these limitations, MS-Occ, a novel multi-stage LiDAR-camera fusion framework which includes middle-stage fusion and late-stage fusion, is proposed, integrating LiDAR's geometric fidelity with camera-based semantic richness via hierarchical cross-modal fusion. The framework introduces innovations at two critical stages: (1) In the middle-stage feature fusion, the Gaussian-Geo module leverages Gaussian kernel rendering on sparse LiDAR depth maps to enhance 2D image features with dense geometric priors, and the Semantic-Aware module enriches LiDAR voxels with semantic context via deformable cross-attention; (2) In the late-stage voxel fusion, the Adaptive Fusion (AF) module dynamically balances voxel features across modalities, while the High Classification Confidence Voxel Fusion (HCCVF) module resolves semantic inconsistencies using self-attention-based refinement. Experiments on two large-scale benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On nuScenes-OpenOccupancy, MS-Occ achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 32.1% and a mean IoU (mIoU) of 25.3%, surpassing the state-of-the-art by +0.7% IoU and +2.4% mIoU. Furthermore, on the SemanticKITTI benchmark, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art mIoU of 24.08%, robustly validating its generalization capabilities.Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each individual module, highlighting substantial improvements in the perception of small objects and reinforcing the practical value of MS-Occ for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[On the Information-Theoretic Fragility of Robust Watermarking under Diffusion Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10933v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust invisible watermarking embeds hidden information in images such that the watermark can survive various manipulations. However, the emergence of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we investigate the intersection of diffusion-based image editing and robust image watermarking. We analyze how diffusion-driven image edits can significantly degrade or even fully remove embedded watermarks from state-of-the-art robust watermarking systems. Both theoretical formulations and empirical experiments are provided. We prove that as a image undergoes iterative diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded payload approaches zero, causing watermark decoding to fail. We further propose a guided diffusion attack algorithm that explicitly targets and erases watermark signals during generation. We evaluate our approach on recent deep learning-based watermarking schemes and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Finally, we discuss ethical implications of such watermark removal capablities and provide design guidelines for future watermarking strategies to be more resilient in the era of generative AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fractured Glass, Failing Cameras: Simulating Physics-Based Adversarial Samples for Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15033v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While much research has recently focused on generating physics-based adversarial samples, a critical yet often overlooked category originates from physical failures within on-board cameras-components essential to the perception systems of autonomous vehicles. Camera failures, whether due to external stresses causing hardware breakdown or internal component faults, can directly jeopardize the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To assess the safety implications, we apply the simulated broken glass effects as image filters to two autonomous driving datasets- KITTI and BDD100K- as well as the large-scale image detection dataset MS-COCO. We then evaluate detection failure rates for critical object classes using CNN-based object detection models (YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and a transformer-based architecture with Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI | None |
| **[Rethinking Target Label Conditioning in Adversarial Attacks: A 2D Tensor-Guided Generative Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14137v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to single-target adversarial attacks, multi-target attacks have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate adversarial images for multiple target classes simultaneously. However, existing generative approaches for multi-target attacks primarily encode target labels into one-dimensional tensors, leading to a loss of fine-grained visual information and overfitting to model-specific features during noise generation. To address this gap, we first identify and validate that the semantic feature quality and quantity are critical factors affecting the transferability of targeted attacks: 1) Feature quality refers to the structural and detailed completeness of the implanted target features, as deficiencies may result in the loss of key discriminative information; 2) Feature quantity refers to the spatial sufficiency of the implanted target features, as inadequacy limits the victim model's attention to this feature. Based on these findings, we propose the 2D Tensor-Guided Adversarial Fusion (TGAF) framework, which leverages the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional semantic tensors for guiding adversarial noise generation. Additionally, we design a novel masking strategy tailored for the training process, ensuring that parts of the generated noise retain complete semantic information about the target class. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGAF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across various settings.</p></details> | AAAI-26 (Oral) | None |
| **[Accuracy-Preserving CNN Pruning Method under Limited Data Availability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10861v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Image Restoration via Latent Consistency Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03500v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative image restoration (IR) have demonstrated impressive results. However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR addresses the distortion-perception trade-off within the latent space and produces high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. In addition, ELIR introduces an efficient and lightweight architecture. Consequently, ELIR is 4$\times$ smaller and faster than state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches for blind face restoration, enabling a deployment on resource-constrained devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks and datasets show that ELIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while significantly reducing model size and computational cost.

| **[Frequency-Aware Vision-Language Multimodality Generalization Network for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10774v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The booming remote sensing (RS) technology is giving rise to a novel multimodality generalization task, which requires the model to overcome data heterogeneity while possessing powerful cross-scene generalization ability. Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Formalizing Spuriousness of Biased Datasets Using Partial Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00482v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spuriousness arises when there is an association between two or more variables in a dataset that are not causally related. In this work, we propose an explainability framework to preemptively disentangle the nature of such spurious associations in a dataset before model training. We leverage a body of work in information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to decompose the total information about the target into four non-negative quantities, namely unique information (in core and spurious features, respectively), redundant information, and synergistic information. Our framework helps anticipate when the core or spurious feature is indispensable, when either suffices, and when both are jointly needed for an optimal classifier trained on the dataset. Next, we leverage this decomposition to propose a novel measure of the spuriousness of a dataset. We arrive at this measure systematically by examining several candidate measures, and demonstrating what they capture and miss through intuitive canonical examples and counterexamples. Our framework Spurious Disentangler consists of segmentation, dimensionality reduction, and estimation modules, with capabilities to specifically handle high-dimensional image data efficiently. Finally, we also perform empirical evaluation to demonstrate the trends of unique, redundant, and synergistic information, as well as our proposed spuriousness measure across $6$ benchmark datasets under various experimental settings. We observe an agreement between our preemptive measure of dataset spuriousness and post-training model generalization metrics such as worst-group accuracy, further supporting our proposition.

Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 camera ready.

We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.</p></details> | 2 figures, 11 pages | None |
| **[A Style is Worth One Code: Unlocking Code-to-Style Image Generation with Discrete Style Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10555v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests. Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Consistent and Efficient Dataset Distillation via Diffusion-Driven Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09959v4)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation provides an effective approach to reduce memory and computational costs by optimizing a compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the full original. However, for large-scale datasets and complex deep networks (e.g., ImageNet-1K with ResNet-101), the vast optimization space hinders distillation effectiveness, limiting practical applications. Recent methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to directly generate informative images, thereby bypassing pixel-level optimization and achieving promising results. Nonetheless, these approaches often suffer from distribution shifts between the pre-trained diffusion prior and target datasets, as well as the need for multiple distillation steps under varying settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that is orthogonal to existing diffusion-based distillation techniques by utilizing the diffusion prior for patch selection rather than generation. Our method predicts noise from the diffusion model conditioned on input images and optional text prompts (with or without label information), and computes the associated loss for each image-patch pair. Based on the loss differences, we identify distinctive regions within the original images. Furthermore, we apply intra-class clustering and ranking on the selected patches to enforce diversity constraints. This streamlined pipeline enables a one-step distillation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics and settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability.

| **[Panda: Test-Time Adaptation with Negative Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10481v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Continuum Dropout for Neural Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10446v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

To assess robustness under such conditions, we propose new long-tail evaluation settings that repartition datasets to create challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets. We first introduce a safety-informed scenario factorization framework, which disentangles scenarios into discrete ego and social contexts. Building on analogies to compositional zero-shot image-labeling in Computer Vision, we then hold out novel context combinations to construct challenging closed-world and open-world settings. This process induces OOD performance gaps in future motion prediction of 5.0% and 14.7% in closed-world and open-world settings, respectively, relative to in-distribution performance for a state-of-the-art baseline. To improve generalization, we extend task-modular gating networks to operate within trajectory prediction models, and develop an auxiliary, difficulty-prediction head to refine internal representations. Our strategies jointly reduce the OOD performance gaps to 2.8% and 11.5% in the two settings, respectively, while still improving in-distribution performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Depth-Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting via Physical Defocus Modeling and Multi-View Geometric Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10316v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is being withdrawn because we have identified a significant error in the implementation of our self-supervised clustering approach.

This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of digital image watermarking techniques implemented using the spatial domain (Least Significant Bit - LSB), the frequency domain (Discrete Fourier Transform - DFT), and a novel hybrid (LSB+DFT) approach. The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between imperceptibility (measured by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - PSNR) and robustness (measured by Normalized Correlation - NC and Bit Error Rate - BER). We implemented these three techniques within a unified MATLAB-based experimental framework. The watermarked images were subjected to a battery of common image processing attacks, including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and salt-and-pepper noise, at varying intensities. Experimental results generated from standard image datasets (USC-SIPI) demonstrate that while LSB provides superior imperceptibility, it is extremely fragile. The DFT method offers significant robustness at the cost of visual quality. The proposed hybrid LSB+DFT technique, which leverages redundant embedding and a fallback extraction mechanism, is shown to provide the optimal balance, maintaining high visual fidelity while exhibiting superior resilience to all tested attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2026</p></details> | None |

However, popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent advancements have explored optimization-based and learning-based layer-wise image vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://layerpeeler.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method. More implementation details and extended results are available at https://github.com/sugelamyd123/Sup-for-GEA.</p></details> | 8pages,3figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/sugelamyd123/Sup-for-GEA) |

To this end, we introduce ImageSet2Text, a novel method to automatically generate natural language descriptions of image sets. Based on large language models, visual-question answering chains, an external lexical graph, and CLIP-based verification, ImageSet2Text iteratively extracts key concepts from image subsets and organizes them into a structured concept graph. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating the quality of the generated descriptions in terms of accuracy, completeness, and user satisfaction. We also examine the method's behavior through ablation studies, scalability assessments, and failure analyses. Results demonstrate that ImageSet2Text combines data-driven AI and symbolic representations to reliably summarize large image collections for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, some foundation SNN backbones (including Spikformer and SEW ResNet) suffer from non-spike computations (integer-float multiplications) caused by the structure of their residual connections. These non-spike computations increase SNNs' power consumption and make them unsuitable for deployment on mainstream neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we analyze the spike-driven behavior of the residual connection methods in SNNs. We then present Spikingformer, a novel spiking transformer backbone that merges the MS Residual connection with Self-Attention in a biologically plausible way to address the non-spike computation challenge in Spikformer while maintaining global modeling capabilities. We evaluate Spikingformer across 13 datasets spanning large static images, neuromorphic data, and natural language tasks, and demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of Spikingformer, setting a vital benchmark for spiking neural networks. In addition, with the spike-driven features and global modeling capabilities, Spikingformer is expected to become a more efficient general-purpose SNN backbone towards energy-efficient artificial intelligence.

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation in the First Interdisciplinary Workshop on Responsible AI for Value Creation.

In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the AI4NextG Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.</p></details> |  | None |

CLTS leverages pre-trained vision-language models, BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) for caption generation and stable diffusion for sample generation. Each task is handled by a dedicated Task Head, while a Task Router learns to assign inputs to the correct Task Head using the generated data. On three benchmark datasets, CLTS improves average task accuracy by up to 54% and achieves 63 times better memory efficiency compared to four recent continual learning baselines, demonstrating improved retention and adaptability. CLTS introduces a novel perspective by integrating generative text-image augmentation for scalable continual learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the revised and peer-reviewed version of our paper, accepted and published in the Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025)</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed to achieve accurate and efficient detection of transmission line defects from UAV-acquired images. The model integrates four major components: an edge-enhanced ResNet backbone to strengthen boundary-sensitive representations, a stride-free space-to-depth module to enable detail-preserving downsampling, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention mechanism to jointly model global context and local cues, and a Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve the localization of small and difficult objects. Together, these designs effectively mitigate the limitations of conventional detectors. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR achieves superior detection performance and strong generalization capability, while maintaining modest computational overhead. The accuracy and efficiency of TinyDef-DETR make it a suitable method for UAV-based transmission line defect detection, particularly in scenarios involving small and ambiguous objects.</p></details> |  | None |

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image, without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and (RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators such as SpeechT5. Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Accepted at Workshop on AI for Cyber Threat Intelligence, co-located with ACSAC 2025</p></details> | None |

A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.</p></details> | To appear at AAAI-26 | None |
| **[DBGroup: Dual-Branch Point Grouping for Weakly Supervised 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10003v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation is essential for 3D scene understanding, especially as the growing scale of data and high annotation costs associated with fully supervised approaches. Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages; 7figures; 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Difference Vector Equalization for Robust Fine-tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09973v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Equivariant Sampling for Improving Diffusion Model-based Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09965v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method is compatible with previous problem-agnostic DMIR methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs.

To mitigate this, we propose LISA, a Layer-wise Integration and Suppression Approach. LISA leverages the layer-wise functional roles in MLLMs: shallow layers provide visual grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify spurious signals. First, layer-wise spectral modulation stabilizes attention by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces hallucinations by up to 53.6% in $\text{CHAIR}_\text{I}$ and improves POPE F1 by up to 5.1%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

| **[Robust Object Detection with Pseudo Labels from VLMs using Per-Object Co-teaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09955v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Debiased Dual-Invariant Defense for Adversarially Robust Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09933v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.</p></details> | Independent Work | None |

Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scale-Aware Relay and Scale-Adaptive Loss for Tiny Object Detection in Aerial Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09891v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).</p></details> |  | None |

However, using masked images diversifies perceptual inputs, potentially offering significant advantages in concept learning with large-scale Transformer models. To this end, we propose Multi-layer Concept Map (MCM), the first work to devise an efficient concept learning method based on masked images. In particular, we introduce an asymmetric concept learning architecture by establishing correlations between different encoder and decoder layers, updating concept tokens using backward gradients from reconstruction tasks. The learned concept tokens at various levels of granularity help either reconstruct the masked image patches by filling in gaps or guide the reconstruction results in a direction that reflects specific concepts. Moreover, we present both quantitative and qualitative results across a wide range of metrics, demonstrating that MCM significantly reduces computational costs by training on fewer than 75% of the total image patches while enhancing concept prediction performance. Additionally, editing specific concept tokens in the latent space enables targeted image generation from masked images, aligning both the visible contextual patches and the provided concepts. By further adjusting the testing time mask ratio, we could produce a range of reconstructions that blend the visible patches with the provided concepts, proportional to the chosen ratios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.

However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gradient-Guided Exploration of Generative Model's Latent Space for Controlled Iris Image Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09749v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.</p></details> |  | None |

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.</p></details> | 7 figures, 3 tables | None |

However, tuning microscopy controls (e.g. scanning speed, current setpoint, tip bias etc.) to obtain a high-quality of images is a non-trivial and time-consuming effort. On the other hand, with sub-standard images, the key features are not accurately discovered due to noise and artifacts, leading to erroneous analysis. Existing denoising models mostly build on generalizing the weak signals as noises while the strong signals are enhanced as key features, which is not always the case in microscopy images, thus can completely erase a significant amount of hidden physical information. To address these limitations, we propose a global denoising model (GDM) to smartly remove artifacts of microscopy images while preserving weaker but physically important features. The proposed model is developed based on 1) first designing a two-imaging input channel of non-pair and goal specific pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off information between two channels and 2) then integrating a loss function of pixel- and fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) based on training the U-net model. We compared the proposed GDM with the non-FFT denoising model over STM-generated images of Copper(Cu) and Silicon(Si) materials, AFM-generated Pantoea sp.YR343 bio-film images and SEM-generated plastic degradation images. We believe this proposed workflow can be extended to improve other microscopy image quality and will benefit the experimentalists with the proposed design flexibility to smartly tune via domain-experts preferences.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures | None |

Given a large, unstructured image collection, the goal is to automatically discover several, diverse semantic clustering criteria (e.g., Activity or Location) from the images, and subsequently organize them according to the discovered criteria, without requiring any human input. Our framework, X-Cluster: eXploratory Clustering, treats text as a reasoning proxy: it concurrently scans the entire image collection, proposes candidate criteria in natural language, and groups images into meaningful clusters per criterion. This radically differs from previous works, which either assume predefined clustering criteria or fixed cluster counts. To evaluate X-Cluster, we create two new benchmarks, COCO-4C and Food-4C, each annotated with four distinct grouping criteria and corresponding cluster labels. Experiments show that X-Cluster can effectively reveal meaningful partitions on several datasets. Finally, we use X-Cluster to achieve various real-world applications, including uncovering hidden biases in text-to-image (T2I) generative models and analyzing image virality on social media. Code and datasets will be open-sourced for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[Density Estimation and Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09723v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains, evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation in discrete spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://hexiaoxiao-cs.github.io/DICE/.

We study monoids containing only such matrices. A finite set of zero-one matrices generating such a monoid can be seen as the matrix representation of an unambiguous finite automaton, an important generalisation of deterministic finite automata which shares many of their good properties. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set of $n \times n$ zero-one matrices generating a monoid of zero-one matrices, and $m$ be the cardinality of $\mathcal{A}$. We study the computational complexity of computing the minimum rank of a matrix in the monoid generated by $\mathcal{A}$. By using linear-algebraic techniques, we show that this problem is in $\textsf{NC}$ and can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(mn^4)$ time. We also provide a combinatorial algorithm finding a matrix of minimum rank in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2 + ω} + mn^4)$ time, where $2 \le ω\le 2.4$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. As a byproduct, we show a very weak version of a generalisation of the Černý conjecture: there always exists a straight line program of size $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ describing a product resulting in a matrix of minimum rank. For the special case corresponding to total DFAs (that is, for the case where all matrices have exactly one 1 in each row), the minimum rank is the size of the smallest image of the set of all states under the action of a word. Our combinatorial algorithm finds a matrix of minimum rank in time $\mathcal{O}(n^3 + mn^2)$ in this case.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the complexity of interpreting CTPA scans and generating accurate radiology reports remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Abn-BLIP (Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), an advanced diagnosis model designed to align abnormal findings to generate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of radiology reports. By leveraging learnable queries and cross-modal attention mechanisms, our model demonstrates superior performance in detecting abnormalities, reducing missed findings, and generating structured reports compared to existing methods. Our experiments show that Abn-BLIP outperforms state-of-the-art medical vision-language models and 3D report generation methods in both accuracy and clinical relevance. These results highlight the potential of integrating multimodal learning strategies for improving radiology reporting.

| **[Minimax Analysis of Estimation Problems in Coherent Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18503v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike conventional imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, which are often well described by a linear regression framework, coherent imaging systems follow a significantly more complex model. In these systems, the task is to estimate the unknown image ${\boldsymbol x}_o \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from observations ${\boldsymbol y}_1, \ldots, {\boldsymbol y}_L \in \mathbb{R}^m$ of the form \[ {\boldsymbol y}_l = A_l X_o {\boldsymbol w}_l + {\boldsymbol z}_l, \quad l = 1, \ldots, L, \] where $X_o = \mathrm{diag}({\boldsymbol x}_o)$ is an $n \times n$ diagonal matrix, ${\boldsymbol w}_1, \ldots, {\boldsymbol w}_L \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,I_n)$ represent speckle noise, and ${\boldsymbol z}_1, \ldots, {\boldsymbol z}_L \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,σ_z^2 I_m)$ denote additive noise. The matrices $A_1, \ldots, A_L$ are known forward operators determined by the imaging system. The fundamental limits of conventional imaging systems have been extensively studied through sparse linear regression models. However, the limits of coherent imaging systems remain largely unexplored. Our goal is to close this gap by characterizing the minimax risk of estimating ${\boldsymbol x}_o$ in high-dimensional settings. Motivated by insights from sparse regression, we observe that the structure of ${\boldsymbol x}_o$ plays a crucial role in determining the estimation error. In this work, we adopt a general notion of structure based on the covering numbers, which is more appropriate for coherent imaging systems. We show that the minimax mean squared error (MSE) scales as \[ \frac{\max\{σ_z^4,\, m^2,\, n^2\}\, k \log n}{m^2 n L}, \] where $k$ is a parameter that quantifies the effective complexity of the class of images.</p></details> | 63 pages | None |

Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there are significant challenges that hinder the optimal use of multimodal e-commerce data by foundation models: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality multimodal benchmark datasets; and (2) the lack of effective multimodal information integration methods. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce MMECInstruct, the first-ever, large-scale, and high-quality multimodal instruction dataset for e-commerce. We also develop CASLIE, a simple, lightweight, yet effective framework for integrating multimodal information for e-commerce. Leveraging MMECInstruct, we fine-tune a series of e-commerce MFMs within CASLIE, denoted as CASLIE models. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that CASLIE models substantially outperform 5 categories of advanced baseline models in the in-domain evaluation. Moreover, CASLIE models show strong generalizability to out-of-domain settings.

Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

Traditional methods are often fixed and only work with one type of carrier media. This means they don't work well with all the different types of media that are out there. This system doesn't send data to "weak" or easily detectable carriers because it can't adapt. This makes the system less safe and less secret in general. This paper proposes a novel Intelligent Carrier Allocation framework founded on a Cross-Modal Reasoning (CMR) Engine. This engine looks at a wide range of carriers, such as images, audio, and text, to see if they are good for steganography. It uses important measurements like entropy, signal complexity, and vocabulary richness to come up with a single reliability score for each modality. The framework uses these scores to fairly and intelligently share the secret bitstream, giving more data to carriers that are thought to be stronger and more complex. This adaptive allocation strategy makes the system as hard to find as possible and as strong as possible against steganalysis. We demonstrate that this reasoning-based approach is more secure and superior in data protection compared to static, non-adaptive multimodal techniques. This makes it possible to build stronger and smarter secret communication systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, existing unsupervised methods for maritime object classification often struggle with the long-tail data distributions in both object categories and weather conditions. In this paper, we construct a dataset named AIMO produced by large-scale generative models with diverse weather conditions and balanced object categories, and collect a dataset named RMO with real-world images where long-tail issue exists. We propose a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages AIMO (source domain) to address the problem of limited labeled data, unbalanced distribution and domain shift in RMO (target domain), enhance the generalization of source features with the Vision-Language Models such as CLIP, and propose a difficulty score for curriculum learning to optimize training process. Experimental results shows that the proposed method significantly improves the classification accuracy, particularly for samples within rare object categories and weather conditions.

Recent studies have demonstrated the practical advantages of Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS), notably its ability to achieve stable information embedding and extraction without any additional network training. However, the stego images generated by FNNS still exhibit noticeable distortion and limited robustness. These drawbacks compromise the security of the embedded information and restrict the practical applicability of the method. To address these limitations, we propose Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography (RFNNS). Specifically, a texture-aware localization technique selectively embeds perturbations carrying secret information into regions of complex textures, effectively preserving visual quality. Additionally, a robust steganographic perturbation generation (RSPG) strategy is designed to enhance the decoding accuracy, even under common and unknown attacks. These robust perturbations are combined with AI-generated cover images to produce stego images. Experimental results demonstrate that RFNNS significantly improves robustness compared to state-of-the-art FNNS methods, achieving an average increase in SSIM of 23\% for recovered secret images under common attacks. Furthermore, the LPIPS value of recovered secrets images against previously unknown attacks achieved by RFNNS was reduced to 39\% of the SOTA method, underscoring its practical value for covert communication.</p></details> |  | None |

Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://wm-po.github.io</p></details> | None |

We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through edit operations$\unicode{x2013}$insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori. Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |

Existing AI-generated image detection (AGID) methods often overfit to known generators and falter on outputs from newer or unseen models. We introduce the Visual Counter Turing Test (VCT2), a comprehensive benchmark of 166,000 images, comprising both real and synthetic prompt-image pairs produced by six state-of-the-art T2I systems: Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, SD3 Medium, SD3.5 Large, DALL.E 3, and Midjourney 6. We curate two distinct subsets: COCOAI, featuring structured captions from MS COCO, and TwitterAI, containing narrative-style tweets from The New York Times. Under a unified zero-shot evaluation, we benchmark 17 leading AGID models and observe alarmingly low detection accuracy, 58% on COCOAI and 58.34% on TwitterAI. To transcend binary classification, we propose the Visual AI Index (VAI), an interpretable, prompt-agnostic realism metric based on twelve low-level visual features, enabling us to quantify and rank the perceptual quality of generated outputs with greater nuance. Correlation analysis reveals a moderate inverse relationship between VAI and detection accuracy: Pearson of -0.532 on COCOAI and -0.503 on TwitterAI, suggesting that more visually realistic images tend to be harder to detect, a trend observed consistently across generators. We release COCOAI, TwitterAI, and all codes to catalyze future advances in generalized AGID and perceptual realism assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |

Large language models (LLMs)-powered agents offer a promising solution by enabling dynamic task planning and predictive decision support. Despite recent advances, the absence of surgical agent datasets and robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques limits the development of LLM agents capable of complex intraoperative reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Surgical AI Copilot, an LLM agent for image-guided pituitary surgery, capable of conversation, planning, and task execution in response to queries involving tasks such as MRI tumor segmentation, endoscope anatomy segmentation, overlaying preoperative imaging with intraoperative views, instrument tracking, and surgical visual question answering (VQA). To enable structured agent planning, we develop the PitAgent dataset, a surgical context-aware planning dataset covering surgical tasks like workflow analysis, instrument localization, anatomical segmentation, and query-based reasoning. Additionally, we propose DEFT-GaLore, a Deterministic Energy-based Fourier Transform (DEFT) gradient projection technique for efficient low-rank adaptation of recent LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3.2, Qwen 2.5), enabling their use as surgical agent planners. We extensively validate our agent's performance and the proposed adaptation technique against other state-of-the-art low-rank adaptation methods on agent planning and prompt generation tasks, including a zero-shot surgical VQA benchmark, demonstrating the significant potential for truly efficient and scalable surgical LLM agents in real-time operative settings.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

However, existing pipelines mostly yield semantic-level prompts, which drive SAM to coarse semantic masks and struggle to handle multiple discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical limitation, we propose an \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF) tailored for the first training-free COS that upgrades prompt granularity from semantic to instance-level while keeping all components frozen. The centerpiece is an Instance Mask Generator that (i) leverages a detector-agnostic enumerator to produce precise instance-level box prompts for the foreground tag, and (ii) introduces the Single-Foreground Multi-Background Prompting (SFMBP) strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts within each box prompt, enabling SAM to output instance masks. The pipeline is supported by a simple text prompt generator that produces image-specific tags and a self-consistency vote across synonymous task-generic prompts to stabilize inference. Extensive evaluations on three COS benchmarks, two CIS benchmarks, and two downstream datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods.

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.</p></details> |  | None |

Using a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) as its central reasoning engine, EyeAgent interprets user queries and dynamically orchestrates 53 validated ophthalmic tools across 23 imaging modalities for diverse tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, image/report generation, and quantitative analysis. Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 5 figures | None |

Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel CAD data annotation engine that leverages intrinsic attributes from systematically archived CAD drawings to automatically generate high-quality annotations, thus significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. Utilizing this engine, we construct ArchCAD-400K, a large-scale CAD dataset consisting of 413,062 chunks from 5538 highly standardized drawings, making it over 26 times larger than the largest existing CAD dataset. ArchCAD-400K boasts an extended drawing diversity and broader categories, offering line-grained annotations. Furthermore, we present a new baseline model for panoptic symbol spotting, termed Dual-Pathway Symbol Spotter (DPSS). It incorporates an adaptive fusion module to enhance primitive features with complementary image features, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DPSS, demonstrating the value of ArchCAD-400K and its potential to drive innovation in architectural design and construction.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models. These results suggest that the apparent "reasoning" of VLMs often reflects prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Several studies propose robust watermarking methods to track the copyright of Screen-Camera (SC) images, facilitating post-hoc certification against infringement. These techniques typically employ heuristic mathematical modeling or supervised neural network fitting as the noise layer, to enhance watermarking robustness against SC. However, both strategies cannot fundamentally achieve an effective approximation of SC noise. Mathematical simulation suffers from biased approximations due to the incomplete decomposition of the noise and the absence of interdependence among the noise components. Supervised networks require paired data to train the noise-fitting model, and it is difficult for the model to learn all the features of the noise. To address the above issues, we propose Simulation-to-Real (S2R). Specifically, an unsupervised noise layer employs unpaired data to learn the discrepancy between the modeled simulated noise distribution and the real-world SC noise distribution, rather than directly learning the mapping from sharp images to real-world images. Learning this transformation from simulation to reality is inherently simpler, as it primarily involves bridging the gap in noise distributions, instead of the complex task of reconstructing fine-grained image details. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating superior watermark robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-2026</p></details> | None |

The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches rely on generative models to synthesize multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction and animation. However, directly generating multiple views from a single human image suffers from geometric inconsistencies, resulting in issues like fragmented or blurred limbs in the reconstructed models. To tackle these limitations, we introduce \textbf{HumanDreamer-X}, a novel framework that integrates multi-view human generation and reconstruction into a unified pipeline, which significantly enhances the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models. In this framework, 3D Gaussian Splatting serves as an explicit 3D representation to provide initial geometry and appearance priority. Building upon this foundation, \textbf{HumanFixer} is trained to restore 3DGS renderings, which guarantee photorealistic results. Furthermore, we delve into the inherent challenges associated with attention mechanisms in multi-view human generation, and propose an attention modulation strategy that effectively enhances geometric details identity consistency across multi-view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly improves generation and reconstruction PSNR quality metrics by 16.45% and 12.65%, respectively, achieving a PSNR of up to 25.62 dB, while also showing generalization capabilities on in-the-wild data and applicability to various human reconstruction backbone models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://humandreamer-x.github.io/</p></details> | None |

In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to traditional detection methods and human evaluators, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

Models such as CLIP are currently widely used to bridge cross-modal representations, and text-to-image diffusion models are arguably the leading models in terms of realistic image generation. Image generative models are trained on massive datasets that provide them with powerful internal spatial representations. In this work, we explore the potential benefits of such representations, beyond image generation, in particular, for dense visual prediction tasks. We focus on the task of image segmentation, which is traditionally solved by training models on closed-vocabulary datasets, with pixel-level annotations. To avoid the annotation cost or training large diffusion models, we constraint our setup to be zero-shot and training-free. In a nutshell, our pipeline leverages different and relatively small-sized, open-source foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. The pipeline is as follows: the image is passed to both a captioner model (i.e. BLIP) and a diffusion model (i.e., Stable Diffusion Model) to generate a text description and visual representation, respectively. The features are clustered and binarized to obtain class agnostic masks for each object. These masks are then mapped to a textual class, using the CLIP model to support open-vocabulary. Finally, we add a refinement step that allows to obtain a more precise segmentation mask. Our approach (dubbed FreeSeg-Diff), which does not rely on any training, outperforms many training-based approaches on both Pascal VOC and COCO datasets. In addition, we show very competitive results compared to the recent weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. We provide comprehensive experiments showing the superiority of diffusion model features compared to other pretrained models.

| **[Towards Understanding the Mechanisms of Classifier-Free Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19210v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a core technique powering state-of-the-art image generation systems, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we begin by analyzing CFG in a simplified linear diffusion model, where we show its behavior closely resembles that observed in the nonlinear case. Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and (iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the behavior of its nonlinear counterpart. Although the two eventually diverge at low noise levels, we discuss how the insights from the linear analysis still shed light on the CFG's mechanism in the nonlinear regime.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Identifying Drift, Diffusion, and Causal Structure from Temporal Snapshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22729v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from data is a challenging task, especially if individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution lacks any generalized rotational symmetries. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that APPEX iteratively decreases Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true solution, and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Prompt-Based Safety Guidance Is Ineffective for Unlearned Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04834v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1) fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of input prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Generative and Protective AI for Content Creation</p></details> | None |

This study introduces G-TRACE (GenAI Transformative Carbon Estimator), a cross-modal, region-aware framework that quantifies training- and inference-related emissions across modalities and deployment geographies. Using real-world analytics and microscopic simulation, G-TRACE measures energy use and carbon intensity per output type (text, image, video) and reveals how decentralized inference amplifies small per-query energy costs into system-level impacts. Through the Ghibli-style image generation trend (2024-2025), we estimate 4,309 MWh of energy consumption and 2,068 tCO2 emissions, illustrating how viral participation inflates individual digital actions into tonne-scale consequences. Building on these findings, we propose the AI Sustainability Pyramid, a seven-level governance model linking carbon accounting metrics (L1-L7) with operational readiness, optimization, and stewardship. This framework translates quantitative emission metrics into actionable policy guidance for sustainable AI deployment. The study contributes to the quantitative assessment of emerging digital infrastructures as a novel category of climate risk, supporting adaptive governance for sustainable technology deployment. By situating GenAI within climate-risk frameworks, the work advances data-driven methods for aligning technological innovation with global decarbonization and resilience objectives.</p></details> | 27 page, 4 figures | None |

To avoid the prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++ optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones ($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals, $\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer $\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent $2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, federated fine-tuning has emerged, allowing FMs to be fine-tuned on distributed datasets across multiple devices while ensuring data privacy. However, the substantial parameter size and the multi-round communication in federated learning algorithms result in prohibitively high communication costs, challenging the practicality of federated fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify and analyze, both theoretically and empirically, that the traditional multi-round aggregation algorithms may not be necessary for federated fine-tuning large FMs. Our experiments reveal that a single round of aggregation (i.e., one-shot federated fine-tuning) yields a global model performance comparable to that achieved through multiple rounds of aggregation. Through rigorous mathematical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that large FMs, due to their extensive parameter sizes and pre-training on general tasks, achieve significantly lower training loss in one-shot federated fine-tuning compared to smaller models. Our extensive experiments show that one-shot federated fine-tuning significantly reduces communication costs. It also has the potential to enable asynchronous aggregation, enhances privacy, and maintains performance consistency with multi-round federated fine-tuning on both text generation and text-to-image generation tasks. Our findings provide insights to revolutionize federated fine-tuning in practice, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and expanding accessibility for FMs.</p></details> |  | None |

Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency.

Embedding Space Exploration, especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models. Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts (P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning. This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space exploration of deep generative models and outlines future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, 6 appendix figures, 1 appendix table</p></details> | None |

However, prior work typically (i) introduces extra latent variables and heavy image generators that bias training toward reconstruction, (ii) fixes a single data-generating direction (\(Y\rightarrow\!X\) or \(X\rightarrow\!Y\)), limiting adaptability, and (iii) assumes a uniform prior over clean labels, ignoring instance-level uncertainty. We propose a single-stage, EM-style framework for generative noisy-label learning that is \emph{direction-agnostic} and avoids explicit image synthesis. First, we derive a single Expectation-Maximization (EM) objective whose E-step specializes to either causal orientation without changing the overall optimization. Second, we replace the intractable \(p(X\mid Y)\) with a dataset-normalized discriminative proxy computed using a discriminative classifier on the finite training set, retaining the structural benefits of generative modeling at much lower cost. Third, we introduce \emph{Partial-Label Supervision} (PLS), an instance-specific prior over clean labels that balances coverage and uncertainty, improving data-dependent regularization. Across standard vision and natural language processing (NLP) noisy-label benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, lower transition-matrix estimation error, and substantially less training compute than current generative and discriminative baselines.

Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering), a training-free framework for concept erasure in diffusion models using steering vectors to influence hidden representations dynamically. CASteer precomputes concept-specific steering vectors by averaging neural activations from images generated for each target concept. During inference, it dynamically applies these vectors to suppress undesired concepts only when they appear, ensuring that unrelated regions remain unaffected. This selective activation enables precise, context-aware erasure without degrading overall image quality. This approach achieves effective removal of harmful or unwanted content across a wide range of visual concepts, all without model retraining. CASteer outperforms state-of-the-art concept erasure techniques while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects.

At its core is a speech information bottleneck (SIB) module, which compresses raw speech into compact semantic tokens, preserving prosody and emotional nuance. By operating directly on these tokens, VoxStudio eliminates the need for an additional speech-to-text system, which often ignores the hidden details beyond text, e.g., tone or emotion. We also release VoxEmoset, a large-scale paired emotional speech-image dataset built via an advanced TTS engine to affordably generate richly expressive utterances. Comprehensive experiments on the SpokenCOCO, Flickr8kAudio, and VoxEmoset benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility of our method and highlight key challenges, including emotional consistency and linguistic ambiguity, paving the way for future research.</p></details> | In progress | None |

Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization, yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG), which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches mainly rely on training binary classifiers, which depend heavily on the quantity and quality of available generated images. In this work, we propose a novel framework that exploits geometric differences between the data manifolds of natural and generated images. To exploit this difference, we employ a pair of functions engineered to yield consistent outputs for natural images but divergent outputs for generated ones, leveraging the property that their gradients reside in mutually orthogonal subspaces. This design enables a simple yet effective detection method: an image is identified as generated if a transformation along its data manifold induces a significant change in the loss value of a self-supervised model pre-trained on natural images. Further more, to address diminishing manifold disparities in advanced generative models, we leverage normalizing flows to amplify detectable differences by extruding generated images away from the natural image manifold.

| **[Epistemic Uncertainty for Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05897v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for AI-generated image detection through epistemic uncertainty, aiming to address critical security concerns in the era of generative models. Our key insight stems from the observation that distributional discrepancies between training and testing data manifest distinctively in the epistemic uncertainty space of machine learning models. In this context, the distribution shift between natural and generated images leads to elevated epistemic uncertainty in models trained on natural images when evaluating generated ones. Hence, we exploit this phenomenon by using epistemic uncertainty as a proxy for detecting generated images. This converts the challenge of generated image detection into the problem of uncertainty estimation, underscoring the generalization performance of the model used for uncertainty estimation. Fortunately, advanced large-scale vision models pre-trained on extensive natural images have shown excellent generalization performance for various scenarios. Thus, we utilize these pre-trained models to estimate the epistemic uncertainty of images and flag those with high uncertainty as generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

| **[Inference-Time Personalized Alignment with a Few User Preference Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02966v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of aligning a generative model's response with a user's preferences. Recent works have proposed several different formulations for personalized alignment; however, they either require a large amount of user preference queries or require that the preference be explicitly specified as a text input. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time personalized alignment method, UserAlign, that elicits the user's preferences with a few queries as pairwise response comparisons. In particular, UserAlign builds on the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the best response quickly. Experimental results across several tasks, involving personalized text and image generation, showcase the effectiveness of UserAlign in achieving personalized alignment.</p></details> | NeurIPS'25 paper | None |
| **[A Practical Investigation of Spatially-Controlled Image Generation with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15724v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR https://openreview.net/forum?id=loT6xhgLYK</p></details> | None |
| **[TAUE: Training-free Noise Transplant and Cultivation Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02580v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

However, applying these models to the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks, including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire understanding in the AI community.

| **[Synthetic Crop-Weed Image Generation and its Impact on Model Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02417v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of 10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model training.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Diffusion Transformer meets Multi-level Wavelet Spectrum for Single Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01175v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been widely explored to enhance the performance of image superresolution (SR). Despite some DWT-based methods improving SR by capturing fine-grained frequency signals, most existing approaches neglect the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands, resulting in inconsistencies and unnatural artifacts in the reconstructed images. To address this challenge, we propose a Diffusion Transformer model based on image Wavelet spectra for SR (DTWSR). DTWSR incorporates the superiority of diffusion models and transformers to capture the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands, leading to a more consistence and realistic SR image. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose images into wavelet spectra. A pyramid tokenization method is proposed which embeds the spectra into a sequence of tokens for transformer model, facilitating to capture features from both spatial and frequency domain. A dual-decoder is designed elaborately to handle the distinct variances in low-frequency and high-frequency sub-bands, without omitting their alignment in image generation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with high performance on both perception quality and fidelity.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Oral Paper | None |
| **[Structured Cognitive Loop for Behavioral Intelligence in Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05107v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, but their use as autonomous agents introduces architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often mix cognition, memory, and control in a single prompt, reducing coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings should be regarded as preliminary evidence, with broader tests across model families and task domains planned for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revisions included clarifying that this work is a preliminary study in the Abstract, improving the readability of figures, and adding emphasis on the role of the meta-prompt in the system's architecture and hallucination control</p></details> | None |
| **[Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15591v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.

Classical generative models typically demand extensive computational and sample resources. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods remain limited in scale and often face barren plateaus. We present MediQ-GAN, a quantum-inspired GAN with prototype-guided skip connections and a dual-stream generator that fuses classical and quantum-inspired branches. Its variational quantum circuits inherently preserve full-rank mappings, avoid rank collapse, and are theory-guided to balance expressivity with trainability. Beyond generation quality, we provide the first latent-geometry and rank-based analysis of quantum-inspired GANs, offering theoretical insight into their performance. Across three medical imaging datasets, MediQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models. While validated on IBM hardware for robustness, our contribution is hardware-agnostic, offering a scalable and data-efficient framework for medical image generation and augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unified Diffusion VLA: Vision-Language-Action Model via Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01718v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language instructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an embodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the understanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand, generate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and actions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate processes, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our core philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a synchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions to evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance. We ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process that integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve as the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be intrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified tokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques that optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv with 4$\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world evaluations.

Simply finetuning them on the target style datasets still struggles to grasp the style features. In this work, we present a novel contrastive learning framework to improve the stylization capability of large text-to-image diffusion models. Motivated by the astonishing advance in image generation models that makes synthetic data an intrinsic part of model training in various computer vision tasks, we exploit synthetic image generation in our approach. Usually, the generated synthetic data is dependent on the task, and most of the time it is used to enlarge the available real training dataset. With NSYNC, alternatively, we focus on generating negative synthetic sets to be used in a novel contrastive training scheme along with real positive images. In our proposed training setup, we forward negative data along with positive data and obtain negative and positive gradients, respectively. We then refine the positive gradient by subtracting its projection onto the negative gradient to get the orthogonal component, based on which the parameters are updated. This orthogonal component eliminates the trivial attributes that are present in both positive and negative data and directs the model towards capturing a more unique style. Experiments on various styles of painters and illustrators show that our approach improves the performance over the baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

While recent voxel-based approaches can generate both geometric structures and semantic labels, existing range-view methods are limited to producing unlabeled LiDAR scenes. Relying on pretrained segmentation models to predict the semantic maps often results in suboptimal cross-modal consistency. To address this limitation while preserving the advantages of range-view representations, such as computational efficiency and simplified network design, we propose Spiral, a novel range-view LiDAR diffusion model that simultaneously generates depth, reflectance images, and semantic maps. Furthermore, we introduce novel semantic-aware metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated labeled range-view data. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Spiral achieves state-of-the-art performance with the smallest parameter size, outperforming two-step methods that combine the generative and segmentation models. Additionally, we validate that range images generated by Spiral can be effectively used for synthetic data augmentation in the downstream segmentation training, significantly reducing the labeling effort on LiDAR data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 24 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables; Code at https://dekai21.github.io/SPIRAL/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://dekai21.github.io/SPIRAL) |

Its computational complexity remains a bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space, finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii) it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings. We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>LC an...</summary><p>LC and RT have equal contribution</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we observe that diffusion models struggle to accurately reconstruct mid-band frequency information in real images, suggesting the limitation could serve as a cue for detecting diffusion model generated images. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel method called Frequency-guided Reconstruction Error (FIRE), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the influence of frequency decomposition on reconstruction error. FIRE assesses the variation in reconstruction error before and after the frequency decomposition, offering a robust method for identifying diffusion model generated images. Extensive experiments show that FIRE generalizes effectively to unseen diffusion models and maintains robustness against diverse perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures.

In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap.

However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image.

Such explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet their Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) layer still performs a quadratic query-key interaction for every token pair, spending the bulk of computation on visually weak or redundant correlations. We introduce Visual-Contrast Attention (VCA), a drop-in replacement for MHSA that injects an explicit notion of discrimination while reducing the theoretical complexity from O(N N C) to O(N n C) with n << N. VCA first distils each head's dense query field into a handful of spatially pooled visual-contrast tokens, then splits them into a learnable positive and negative stream whose differential interaction highlights what truly separates one region from another. The module adds fewer than 0.3M parameters to a DeiT-Tiny backbone, requires no extra FLOPs, and is wholly architecture-agnostic. Empirically, VCA lifts DeiT-Tiny top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K from 72.2% to 75.6% (+3.4) and improves three strong hierarchical ViTs by up to 3.1%, while in class-conditional ImageNet generation it lowers FID-50K by 2.1 to 5.2 points across both diffusion (DiT) and flow (SiT) models. Extensive ablations confirm that (i) spatial pooling supplies low-variance global cues, (ii) dual positional embeddings are indispensable for contrastive reasoning, and (iii) combining the two in both stages yields the strongest synergy. VCA therefore offers a simple path towards faster and sharper Vision Transformers.

We trace these limitations to a myopic view of the denoising trajectories that govern diffusion based generation. We introduce EraseFlow, the first framework that casts concept unlearning as exploration in the space of denoising paths and optimizes it with GFlowNets equipped with the trajectory balance objective. By sampling entire trajectories rather than single end states, EraseFlow learns a stochastic policy that steers generation away from target concepts while preserving the model's prior. EraseFlow eliminates the need for carefully crafted reward models and by doing this, it generalizes effectively to unseen concepts and avoids hackable rewards while improving the performance.

Increasingly content on the internet has been artificially generated, leading to concerns that these norms are being exaggerated. The aim of this work is to study how generative AI models may encode 'beauty' and erase 'ugliness', and discuss the implications of this for society. To investigate these aims, we create two image generation pipelines: a text-to-image model and a text-to-language model-to image model. We develop a structured beauty taxonomy which we use to prompt three language models (LMs) and two text-to-image models to cumulatively generate 5984 images using our two pipelines. We then recruit women and non-binary social media users to evaluate 1200 of the images through a Likert-scale within-subjects study. Participants show high agreement in their ratings. Our results show that 86.5% of generated images depicted people with lighter skin tones, 22% contained explicit content despite Safe for Work (SFW) training, and 74% were rated as being in a younger age demographic. In particular, the images of non-binary individuals were rated as both younger and more hypersexualised, indicating troubling intersectional effects. Notably, prompts encoded with 'negative' or 'ugly' beauty traits (such as "a wide nose") consistently produced higher Not SFW (NSFW) ratings regardless of gender. This work sheds light on the pervasive demographic biases related to beauty standards present in generative AI models -- biases that are actively perpetuated by model developers, such as via negative prompting. We conclude by discussing the implications of this on society, which include pollution of the data streams and active erasure of features that do not fall inside the stereotype of what is considered beautiful by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint under review</p></details> | None |
| **[Why Attention Fails: A Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96 projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.</p></details> |  | None |
